<h1 id="a-guide-to-techno-galactic-software-observation">A guide to
techno-galactic software observation</h1>

<blockquote>
<p>I am less interested in the critical practice of reflection, of
showing once-again that the emperor has no clothes, than in finding
a way to <em>diffract</em> critical inquiry in order to make
difference patterns in a more worldly way.<sup id="bafaaafc" class=
"f"><a href="#cfaaafab">1</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>

<p>The techno-galactic software survival guide that you are holding
right now was collectively produced as an outcome of the
Techno-Galactic Software Observatory. This guide proposes several
ways to achieve critical distance from the seemingly endless
software systems that surround us. It offers practical and
fantastical tools for the tactical (mis)use of software,
empowering/enabling users to resist embedded paradigms and
assumptions. It is a collection of methods for approaching
software, experiencing its myths and realities, its risks and
benefits.</p>

<p>With the rise of online services, software use has been
increasingly knitted into production, while suggesting that these
roles constitute separate realms. This has an effect on the way
software is used and produced, and radically alters its operative
role in society. The shifts ripple across galaxies, through social
structures, working conditions and personal relations, resulting in
a profusion of apparatuses aspiring to be seamless while optimizing
and monetizing individual and collective flows of information in
line with the interests of a handful of actors. The diffusion of
software services affects the personal, in the form of intensified
identity shaping and self-management. It also affects the public,
as more and more libraries, universities and public infrastructures
as well as the management of public life rely on "solutions"
provided by private companies. Centralizing data flows in the
clouds, services blur the last traces of the thin line that
separates bio- from necro-politics.</p>

<p>Given how fast these changes resonate and reproduce, there is a
growing urgency to engage in a critique of software that goes
beyond taking a distance, and that deals with the fact that we are
inevitably already entangled. How can we interact, intervene,
respond and think with software? What approaches can allow us to
recognize the agency of different actors, their ways of functioning
and their politics? What methods of observation enable critical
inquiry and affirmative discord? What techniques can we apply to
resurface software where it has melted into the infrastructure and
into the everyday? How can we remember that software is always at
work, especially where it is designed to disappear into the
background?</p>

<p>We took on the term of observation for a number of reasons. We
regard observation as a way to approach software, as one way to
organize engagement with its implications. Observation, and the
enabling of observation through intensive data-centric feedback
mechanisms, is part of the cybernetic principles that underpin
present day software production. Our aim was to scrutinize this
methodology in its many manifestations, including in
"observatories" -- high cost infrastructures [testing
infrastructures?CITECLOSE25236 of observation troubled by colonial,
imperial traditions and their problematic divisions of nature and
culture -- with the hope of opening up questions about who gets to
observe software (and how) and who is being observed by software
(and with what impact)? It is a question of power, one that we
answer, at least in part, with critical play.</p>

<p>We adopted the term techno-galactic to match the advertised
capability of "scaling up to the universe" that comes in
contemporary paradigms of computation, and to address different
scales of software communities and related political economies that
involve and require observation.</p>

<p>Drawing on theories of software and computation developed in
academia and elsewhere, we grounded our methods in hands-on
exercises and experiments that you now can try at home. This Guide
to Techno-Galactic Software Observation offers methods developed in
and inspired by the context of software production, hacker culture,
software studies, computer science research, Free Software
communities, privacy activism, and artistic practice. It invites
you to experiment with ways to stay with the trouble of
software.</p>

<h2 id="the-techno-galactic-software-observatory">The
Techno-Galactic Software Observatory</h2>

<p>In the summer of 2017, around thirty people gathered in Brussels
to explore practices of proximate critique with and of software in
the context of a worksession entitled "Techno-Galactic Software
Observatory".<sup id="fcdcaacb" class="f"><a href=
"#bcaacdcf">2</a></sup> The worksession called for software-curious
people of all kinds to ask questions about software. The intuition
behind such a call was that different types of engagement requires
a heterogeneous group of participants with different levels of
expertise, skill and background. During three sessions of two days,
participants collectively inspected the space-time of computation
and probed the universe of hardware-software separations through
excursions, exercises and conversations. They tried out various
perspectives and methods to look at the larger picture of software
as a concept, as a practice, and as a set of techniques.</p>

<p>The first two days of The Techno-Galactic Software Observatory
included visits to the Mus&eacute;e de l'Informatique
Pionni&egrave;re en Belgique<sup id="ffeaecaa" class="f"><a href=
"#aaceaeff">3</a></sup> in Namur and the Computermuseum
KULeuven<sup id="dbabebfa" class="f"><a href=
"#afbebabd">4</a></sup>. In the surrounding of these collections of
historical &rsquo;numerical artefacts&rsquo;, we started viewing
software in a long-term context. It offered us the occasion to
reflect on the conditions of its appearance, and allowed us to take
on current-day questions from a genealogical perspective. What is
software? How did it appear as a concept, in what industrial and
governmental circumstances? What happens to the material conditions
of its production (minerals, factory labor, hardware) when it
evaporates into a cloud?</p>

<p>The second two days we focused on the space-time dimension of IT
development. The way computer programs and operating systems are
manufactured changed tremendously through time, and so did its
production times and places. From military labs via the
mega-corporation cubicles to the open-space freelancer utopia, what
ruptures and continuities can be traced in the production,
deployment, maintenance and destruction of software? From
time-sharing to user-space partitions and containerization, what
separations were and are at work? Where and when is software made
today?</p>

<h2 id="the-walk-in-clinic">The Walk-in Clinic</h2>

<p>The last two days at the Techno-galactic software observatory
were dedicated to observation and its consequences. The development
of software encompasses a series of practices whose evocative names
are increasingly familiar: feedback, report, probe, audit, inspect,
scan, diagnose, explore, test ... What are the systems of knowledge
and power within which these activities take place, and what other
types of observation are possible? As a practical set for our
investigations, we set up a walk-in clinic on the 25th floor of the
World Trade Center, where users and developers could arrive with
software-questions of all kinds.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Do you suffer from the disappearance of your software into the
cloud, feel oppressed by unequal user privilege, or experience the
torment of software-ransom of any sort? Bring your devices and
interfaces to the World Trade Center! With the help of a clear and
in-depth session, at the Techno-Galactic Walk-In Clinic we
guarantee immediate results. The Walk-In Clinic provides free
hands-on observations to software curious people of all kinds. A
wide range of professional and amateur practitioners will provide
you with Software-as-a-Critique-as-a-Service on the spot. Available
services range from immediate interface critique, collaborative
code inspection, data dowsing, various forms of network analyses,
unusability testing, identification of unknown viruses, risk
assessment, opening of black-boxes and more. Free software
observations provided. Last intake at 16:45.<br>
(invitation to the Walk-In Clinic, June 2017)</p>

the conservation of multiple stages of life of a software since its
initial computerization until today. The idea of introducing
informatics into the work of working with/on the Bible (versions in
Hebrew, Greek, Latin, and French) dates back to 1971, via punch
card recordings and their memorization on magnetic tape. Then came
the step of analyzing texts using computers.</p>

"remember descriptor"><span>Remember:</span> In Unix-like operating
systems, a device file or special file is an interface for a device
driver that appears in a file system as if it were an ordinary
file. In the early days you could fully access your memory via the
memory device (<code>/dev/mem</code>) but over time the access was
more and more restricted in order to avoid malicious processes to
directly access the kernel memory. The kernel option
CONFIG_STRICT_DEVMEM was introduced in kernel version 2.6 and upper
(2.6.36&ndash;2.6.39, 3.0&ndash;3.8, 3.8+HEAD). So you'll need to
use the Linux kernel module fmem: this module creates
<code>/dev/fmem</code> device, that can be used for accessing
physical memory without the limits of /dev/mem (1MB/1GB, depending
on distribution).</span>

<code class="bash">
   ps ax | grep process

<p>The proc filesystem is a pseudo-filesystem which provides an
interface to kernel data structures. It is commonly mounted at
<code>/proc</code>. Most of it is read-only, but some files allow
kernel variables to be changed.</p>

</code>
</pre>

<p>Besides opening the memory dump with an hex editor you can also

<p>The Technogalactic Software Observatory &ndash; Comfortable
silence, one way mirrors</p>

<p>A drinking fountain and screens of one-way mirrors as part of
the work session "<em>The Technogalactic Software Observatory</em>"
organised by Constant.</p>

<p>For the past 100 years the western ideal of a corporate
landscape has been has been moving like a pendulum, oscillating
between grids of cubicles and organic, open landscapes, in a near
to perfect 25-year rhythm. These days the changes in office
organisation is supplemented by sound design, in corporate settings
mostly to create comfortable silence. Increase the sound and the
space becomes more intimate, the person on the table next to you
can not immediately hear what you are saying. It seems that actual
silence in public and corporate spaces has not been sought after
since the start of the 20th century. Actual silence is not at the
moment considered comfortable. One of the visible symptoms of our
desire to take the edge off the silence is to be observed through
the appearance of fountains in public space. The fountains purpose
being to give off neutral sound, like white noise without the
negative connotations. However as a sound engineer's definition of
noise is unwanted sound that all depends on ones personal relation
to the sound of dripping water.</p>

<p>This means that there needs to be a consistent inoffensiveness
to create comfortable silence.</p>

<p>In corporate architecture the arrival of glass buildings were
originally seen as a symbol of transparency, especially loved by
governmental buildings. Yet the reflectiveness of this shiny
surface once combined with strong light &ndash; known as the
treason of the glass &ndash; was only completely embraced at the
invention of one-way-mirror foil. And it was the corporate
business-world that would come to be known for their reflective
glass skyscrapers. As the foil reacts to light, it appears
transparent to someone standing in the dark, while leaving the side
with the most light with an opaque surface. Using this foil as room
dividers in a room with a changing light, what is hidden or visible
will vary throughout the day. So will the need for comfortable
silence. Disclaimer :<br>
Similar to the last 100 years of western office organisation,<br>
this fountain only has two modes:<br>
on or off</p>

<p>If it is on it also offers two options<br>
cold water and hot water</p>

<p>This fountain has been tampered with and has not in any way been
approved by a proffesional fountain cleaner. I do urge you to
consider this before you take the decision to drink from the
fountain.</p>

<p>Should you chose to drink from the fountain, then I urge you to
write your name on your cup, in the designated area, for a
customised experience of my care for you.</p>

<p>I do want you to be comfortable.</p>

<p>Nannyware is software meant to protect users while limiting
their space of activity. It is software that passive-aggressively
suggests or enforces some kind of discipline. In other words,
create a form of parental control extended to adults by means of
user experience / user interfaces.</p>

<p>Nannyware is a form of Content-control software: software
designed to restrict or control the content a reader is authorised
to access, especially when utilised to restrict material delivered
over the Internet via the Web, e-mail, or other means.
Content-control software determines what content will be available
or be blocked.</p>

a government can attempt to apply them nationwide (see Internet

clients, by an employer to its personnel, by a school to its
students, by a library to its visitors, by a parent to a child's

<p>Unlike filtering, accountability software simply reports on
Internet usage. No blocking occurs. In setting it up, you decide
who will receive the detailed report of the computer&rsquo;s usage.
Web sites that are deemed inappropriate, based on the options
you&rsquo;ve chosen, will be red-flagged. Because monitoring
software is of value only &ldquo;after the fact&rdquo;, we do not
recommend this as a solution for families with children. However,
it can be an effective aid in personal accountability for adults.

<p>As with all new lifestyle technologies that come along, in the
beginning there is also some chaos until their impact can be
assessed and rules put in place to bring order and respect to their
implementation and use in society. When the automobile first came
into being there was much confusion regarding who had the right of
way, the horse or the car. There were no paved roads, speed limits,
stop signs, or any other traffic rules. Many lives were lost and
much property was destroyed as a result. Over time, government and
society developed written and unwritten rules as to the proper use
of the car.<sup id="fbaaebbb" class="f"><a href=

<p>Disadvantages of explicit proxy deployment include a user's
ability to alter an individual client configuration and bypass the

<p>The main problem here is that the settings that are required are
different from person to person. For example, I use workrave with a
25 second micropause every two and a half minute, and a 10 minute
restbreak every 20 minutes. I need these frequent breaks, because
I'm recovering from RSI. And as I recover, I change the settings to
fewer breaks. If you have never had any problem at all (using the
computer, that is), then you may want much fewer breaks, say 10
seconds micropause every 10 minutes, and a 5 minute restbreak every
hour. It is very hard to give proper guidelines here. My best
advice is to play around and see what works for you. Which settings
"feel right". Basically, that's how Workrave's defaults
evolve.<sup id="cbbdbff" class="f"><a href=

<h2 id="case-study-w.-w.">Case study : W. W.</h2>

<p>...ww.AsExperiencedAdventerousUSER - experiments with software
every two days as she uses FLOSS and Gnu/Linux, cares the most for
maliabity of the software - as a result she has big expectations of
flexibility even in software category which is quite conventional
and stability focused like file-hosting.</p>

<p>...ww.AsAnInevstorInSoftware - paid compiled version of FLOSS
audio software 5 years ago as she is supportive of economy and work
around production, maintainance and support, but she also used
closed hardware/software where she had to agree on licences she
finds unfair, but then she was hacking it in order to use it as an
expert - when she had time.</p>

<p>...ww.AsCommunicationSoftwareUSER - she is not using commercial
social networks, so she is very concious of information transfers
and time relations, but has no strong media/format/design
focus.</p>

<p>Scrum is a framework for managing software development. It is
designed for teams of three to nine developers who break their work
into actions that can be completed within fixed duration cycles
(called "sprints"), track progress and re-plan in daily 15-minute
stand-up meetings, and collaborate to deliver workable software
every sprint. Approaches to coordinating the work of multiple scrum
teams in larger organizations include Large-Scale Scrum, Scaled

rejecting en bloc all wisdom from the past, just because it is from
the past, adopting fads and new jargon, at times cocky and
arrogant. But I have no doubts that it will mature further, become

<p>Hello and welcome to the presentation of the agile yoga
methodology. I am Allegra, and today I'm going to be your personal
guide to YOGA, an acronym for why organize? Go agile! I'll be part
of your team today and we'll do a few exercises together as an
introduction to a new path into your professional and personal life
towards creativity, focus and health.</p>

<p>A few months ago, I was stressed, overwhelmed with my work,
feeling alone, inadequate, but since I started practicing agile
yoga, I feel more productive. I have many clients as an agile yoga
coach, and I've seen new creative business opportunities coming to
me as a software developer.</p>

<p>For this first experience with the agile yoga method and before
we do physical exercises together, I would like to invite you to
close your eyes. Make yourself comfortable, lying on the floor, or
sitting with your back on the wall. Close your eyes, relax. Get
comfortable. Feel the weight of your body on the floor or on the
wall. Relax.</p>

<p>Leave your troubles at the door. Right now, you are not
procrastinating, you are having a meeting at the &lt;SAY THE NAME
OF YOUR LOCATION HERE&gt;, a professional building dedicated to
business, you are meeting yourself, you are your own business
partner, you are one. You are building your future.</p>

<p>You are in a room standing with your team, a group of lean
programmers. You are watching a white board together. You are
starting your day, a very productive day as you are preparing to
run a sprint together. Now you turn towards each other, making a
scrum with your team, you breathe together, slowly, inhaling and
exhaling together, slowly, feeling the air in and out of your body.
Now you all turn towards the sun to prepare to do your ASSanas, the
agile Sun Salutations or ASS with the team dedicated ASS Master.
She's guiding you. You start with Namaskar, the Salute. your palms
joined together, in prayer pose. you all reflect on the first
principle of the agile manifesto. your highest priority is to
satisfy the customer through early and continuous delivery of
valuable software.</p>

<p>Next pose, is Ardha Chandrasana or (Half Moon Pose). With a deep
inhalation, you raise both arms above your head and tilt slightly
backward arching your back. you welcome changing requirements, even
late in development. Agile processes harness change for the
customer's competitive advantage. then you all do Padangusthasana
(Hand to Foot Pose). With a deep exhalation, you bend forward and
touch the mat, both palms in line with your feet, forehead touching
your knees. you deliver working software frequently.</p>

<p>Surya Darshan (Sun Sight Pose). With a deep inhalation, you take
your right leg away from your body, in a big backward step. Both
your hands are firmly planted on your mat, your left foot between
your hands. you work daily throughout the project, business people
and developers together. now, you're flowing into Purvottanasana
(Inclined Plane) with a deep inhalation by taking your right leg
away from your body, in a big backward step. Both your hands are
firmly planted on your mat, your left foot between your hands. you
build projects around motivated individuals. you give them the
environment and support they need, and you trust them to get the
job done.</p>

<p>You're in Adho Mukha Svanasana (Downward Facing Dog Pose). With
a deep exhalation, you shove your hips and butt up towards the
ceiling, forming an upward arch. Your arms are straight and aligned
with your head. The most efficient and effective method of
conveying information to and within a development team is
face-to-face conversation.</p>

<p>Then, Sashtang Dandawat (Forehead, Chest, Knee to Floor Pose).
With a deep exhalation, you lower your body down till your
forehead, chest, knees, hands and feet are touching the mat, your
butt tilted up. Working software is the primary measure of
progress.</p>

<p>Next is Bhujangasana (Cobra Pose). With a deep inhalation, you
slowly snake forward till your head is up, your back arched
concave, as much as possible. Agile processes promote sustainable
development. You are all maintaining a constant pace indefinitely,
sponsors, developers, and users together.</p>

<p>Now back into Adho Mukha Svanasana (Downward Facing Dog Pose).
Continuous attention to technical excellence and good design
enhances agility.</p>

<p>And then again to Surya Darshan (Sun Sight Pose).
Simplicity--the art of maximizing the amount of work not done--is
essential. Then to Padangusthasana (Hand to Foot Pose). The best
architectures, requirements, and designs emerge from
self-organizing teams.</p>

<p>You all do again Ardha Chandrasana (Half Moon Pose). At regular
intervals, you as the team reflect on how to become more effective,
then tune and adjust your behavior accordingly. you end our ASSanas
session with a salute to honor your agile yoga practices. you have
just had a productive scrum meeting. now i invite you to open your
eyes, move your body around a bit, from the feet up to the head and
back again.</p>

<p>Stand up on your feet and let's do a scrum together if you're ok
being touched on the arms by someone else. if not, you can do it on
your own. so put your hands on the shoulder of the SCP around you.
now we're joined together, let's look at the screen together as we
inhale and exhale. syncing our body together to the rythms of our
own internal software, modulating our oxygen level intake
requirements to the oxygen availability of our service
facilities.</p>

<p>Now, let's do together a couple of exercise to protect and
strengthen our wrists. as programmers, as internauts, as
entrepreneurs, they are a very crucial parts of the body to
protect. in order to be able to type, to swipe, to shake hands
vigourously, we need them in good health. So bring to hands towards
each other in a prayer pose, around a book, a brick. You can do it
without but I'm using my extreme programming book - embrace change
- for that. So press the palms together firmly, press the pad of
your fingers together. do that while breathing in and out
twice.</p>

<p>Now let's expand our arms towards us, in the air, face and
fingers facing down. like we're typing. make your shoulders round.
let's breath while visualizing in our heads the first agile mantra
: Individuals and interactions over processes and tools.</p>

<p>Now let's bring back the arms next to the body and raise them
again. And let's move our hands towards the ceiling this time.
Strenghtening our back. In our head, the second mantra. Working
software over comprehensive documentation. now let's bring back the
hands in the standing position. Then again the first movement while
visualizing the third mantra : Customer collaboration over contract
negotiation and then the second movement thinking about the fourth
and last mantra : Responding to change over following a plan and of
course we continue breathing. Now to finish this session, let's do
a sprint together in the corridor !</p>

Method:</a></span> Something in the Middle Maybe (SitMM)</span>
<span class="what descriptor"><span>What:</span> The network
traffic gets observed. There are different sniffing software out
there which differ in granularity and how far the user can taylor
the different functionality. SitMM builds on one of these tools
called <a href=
"http://www.secdev.org/projects/scapy/">scapy</a>.</span>
<span class="how descriptor"><span>How:</span> SitMM takes a closer
look at the network traffic coming from/going to a software curious
person's device. The software curious person using SitMM may ask to
filter the traffic based on application or device of
interest.</span> <span class=
"who empty descriptor"><span>Who</span></span>
<p>The software curious person gets to observe their own traffic.
Ideally, observing ones own network traffic should be available to
anyone, but using such software can be deemed illegal under
different jurisdictions.</p>

<p>For example, in the US wiretap law limit packet-sniffing to
parties owning the network that is being sniffed or the
availability of consent from one of the communicating parties.
Section 18 U.S. Code &sect; 2511 (2) (a) (i) says:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>It shall not be unlawful ... to intercept ... while engaged in
any activity which is a necessary incident to the rendition of his
service or to the protection of the rights or property of the
provider of that service</p>
</blockquote>

<p>See here for a <a href=
"http://spot.colorado.edu/~sicker/publications/issues.pdf">paper</a>
on the topic. Google went on a big legal spree to defend their
right to capture unencrypted wireless traffic with google street
view cars. The courts were concerned about wiretapping and
infringements on the privacy of users, and not with the leveraging
of private and public WiFi infrastructure for the gain of a for
profit company. The case raises hard questions about the state,
ownership claims and material reality of WiFi signals. So, while
WiFi sniffing is common and the tools like SitMM are widely
available, it is not always possible for software curious persons
to use them legally or to neatly filter out "their traffic" from
that of "others".</p>
<span class="when descriptor"><span>When:</span> SitMM can be used
any time a software curious person feels the weight of the
(invisible) networks.</span> <span class=
"why descriptor"><span>Why:</span> SitMM is intended to be a tool
that gives artists, designers and educators an easy to use custom
WiFi router to work with networks and explore the aspects of our
daily communications that are exposed when we use WiFi. The goal is
to use the output to encourage open discussions about how we use
our devices online.</span> <span class=

the conservation of multiple stages of life of a software since its
initial computerization until today. The idea of introducing
informatics into the work of working with/on the Bible (versions in
Hebrew, Greek, Latin, and French) dates back to 1971, via punch
card recordings and their memorization on magnetic tape. Then came
the step of analyzing texts using computers.</p>

Testing the testbed: testing software with observatory ambitions
(SWOA)</span> <span class=
"warning descriptor"><span>WARNING:</span> this method may make
more sense if you first take a look at the <a href=
"http://pad.constantvzw.org/p/observatory.guide.sitmm">Something in
the Middle Maybe (SitMM)</a> which is an instance of a SWOA</span>
<span class="how descriptor"><span>How:</span> The interwebs hosts
many projects that aim to produce software for observing software,
(from now on Software With Observatory Ambitions (SWOA)). A
comparative methodology can be produced by testing different SWOA
to observe software of interest. Example: use different sniffing
software to observe wireless networks, e.g., wireshark vs tcpdump
vs SitMM. Comparing SWOA reveals what is seen as worthy of
observation (e.g., what protocols, what space, which devices), the
granularity of the observation (e.g., how is the observation
captured, in what detail), the logo and conceptual framework of
choice etc. This type of observation may be turned into a service
(See also: Something in the Middle Maybe (SitMM)).</span>
<span class="when descriptor"><span>When:</span> Ideally, SWOA can
be used everywhere and in every situation. In reality,
institutions, laws and administrators like to limit the use of SWOA
on infrastructures to people who are also administering these
networks. Hence, we are presented with the situation that the use
of SWOA is condoned when it is down by researchers and pen testers
(e.g., they were hired) and shunned when done by others (often
subject to name calling as hackers or attackers).</span>
<span class="what descriptor"><span>What:</span> Deep philosophical
moment: most software has a recursive observatory ambition (it
wants to be observed in its execution, output etc.). Debuggers,
logs, dashboards are all instances of software with observatory
ambitions and can not be separated from software itself. Continuous
integration is the act of folding the whole software development
process into one big feedback loop. So, what separates SWOA from
software itself? Is it the intention of observing software with a
critical, agonistic or adversarial perspective vs one focused on
productivity and efficiency that distinguishes SWOA from software?
What makes SWOA a critical practice over other forms of sotware
observation. If our methodology is testing SWOA, then is it a meta
critique of critique?</span> <span class=
"who descriptor"><span>Who:</span> If you can run multiple SWOAs,
you can do it. The question is: will people like it if you turn
your gaze on their SWOA based methods of observation? Once again we
find that observation can surface power asymmetries and lead to
defensiveness or desires to escape the observation in the case of
the observed, and a instinct to try to conceal that observation is
taking place.</span> <span class=
"urgency descriptor"><span>Urgency:</span> If observation is a form
of critical engagement in that it surfaces the workings of software
that are invisible to many, it follows that people would develop
software to observe (SWOAs). Testing SWOAs puts this form of
critical observation to test with the desire to understand how what
is made transparent through each SWOA also makes things invisible
and reconfigures power.</span> <span class=
"note descriptor"><span>Note:</span> Good SWOA software usually
uses an animal as a logo.:D</span> <span class=
"warning descriptor"><span>WARNING:</span> Many of the SWOA
projects we looked at are promises more than running
software/available code. Much of it is likely to turn into obsolete
gradware, making testing difficult.</span> <span class="tmp">TODO:
