% METHOD: Space-Noise Rearrangements

% REMEMBER:
% WHAT: Interventions in your working-environment 
% HOW: Different strategies can be applied to temporarily redefine the workspace and its perception.
% WHEN:
% WHO: 
% URGENCY: Aknowledging space and its correlate, noise, as conditioning observations (WTC vs. Museum vs. University vs. Startup Office vs. Shifting Walls that became Water Fountains)
% NOTE: EU-OSHA (European Agency for Safety and Health at Work) Directive 2003/10/EC describes the minimum health and safety requirements regarding the exposure of workers to the risks arising from physical agents (noise). However no current European guidelines exist on the potential benefitial uses of tactially designed additive noise systems.
% WARNING:

% EXAMPLE: -

 Fountain refreshment: augmenting a piece of standardised office equipment designed to dispense water to perform a decorative and soothing function.

> Actual silence is not at the moment considered comfortable. One of the visible symptoms of our desire to take the edge off the silence is to be observed through the appearance of fountains in public space. The fountains purpose being to give off neutral sound, like white noise without the negative connotations.

% NOTE: Gaining access to standardised water dispensing equipment turned out to be more difficult than expected as such equipment is typically licensed / rented rather than purchased outright. Acquiring a unit that could be modified required access to secondary markets of second hand office equiment in order to purchase a disused model.

% EXAMPLE: -

One-way mirrors can be used to partition your working environment in a 4-dimensional way.

> As the foil reacts to light, it appears transparent to someone standing in the dark, while leaving the side with the most light with an opaque surface. Using this foil as room dividers in a room with a changing light, what is hidden or visible will vary throughout the day. So will the need for comfortable silence.
