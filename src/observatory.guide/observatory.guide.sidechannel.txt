% METHOD: Side Channel Analysis


% WHAT:    "Leakage from boundaries" is what is considered a side channel attack
% HOW:  As software runs on hardware it emanates radio-magnetic waves. You can build an antenna and use it to capture these waves and reconstruct what the software is doing.
% WHEN:
% REMEMBER:     "Hardware lives in the real world and real world properties lead to side channels"          
% WHO: bad guys/good guys
% URGENCY:  Side Channel attacks are possible by disregarding the abstraction of software into pure logic: the physical effects of the running of software become backdoors to observe its functioning, hence re-affirming the materiality of software.

% NOTE:
% WARNING: **engineers are good guys!**
