% METHOD: Side Channel Analysis

% REMEMBER:

% WHAT:
% HOW:
% WHEN:
% WHO:
% URGENCY:  Side Channel attacks are possible by disregarding the abstraction of software into pure logic: the physical effects of the running of the software become backdoors to observe its functioning, both threatening the control of processes and the re-affirming the materiality of software.
% NOTE:
% WARNING: **engineers are good guys!**
