A spectre is haunting the galaxy. It is neither revolutionary [@marx:1848:cmanifesto] nor is it a global scale vulnerability [@meltdown:2018:spectre17], but no matter where you happen to be, there is the spectre of a software running somewhere in the background. Look! There it is, looking right back at you. Be it your phone screen or a passing satellite, software's observation and entanglement in the everyday feels complete. 

But is it really? The Techno-Galactic Software Survival Guide is an obsessive fantasy of optimization turned on its head, and stuck to the ceiling of a self-reflecting elevator. It is the ultimate book of dos and don'ts, of forgotten histories and un-inevitable futures, of mindful agile presences and improvisational service architectures, and all that you can and cannot imagine needing in a techno-galaxy. Reading is not enough, software is not just a text, observation is one potential beginning, engagement is tickling.

With the rediscovery of online services in the 1990s [@haigh:2001:soft60], the use of software has increasingly been knitted into the production of software, even while the rhetoric, rights and procedures continue to suggest that use and production constitute separate realms. This knitting together and its corresponding disavowal has an effect on the way software is used and produced that radically alters its operative role in society. The shifts ripple across galaxies, through social structures, working conditions and personal relations, resulting in a profusion of apparatuses aspiring to be seamless while optimizing and monetizing individual and collective flows of information in line with the interests of a handful of actors. The diffusion of software services affects the personal, in the form of intensified identity shaping and self-management. It also affects the public, as more and more libraries, universities and public infrastructures as well as the management of public life rely on "solutions" provided by private companies. Centralizing data flows in the clouds, services blur the last traces of the thin line that separates bio- from necro-politics.


Given how fast software resonates and reproduces, there is a growing urgency to engage with it in manners that goes beyond taking a distance, and that deal with the fact that we are inevitably already entangled. (% CARLINSAYS: repetitive?) How can we interact, respond and think with software? What approaches can we use to recognize the agency of different actors, their ways of working and their politics? What methods of observation are conducive to critical inquiry and affirmative discord? What techniques can we apply to resurface software, finding the sites where their infrastructures are reconfiguring the everyday? How can we remember that software is always at work, especially where it is designed to disappear into the background? 

We pick up the word "observation", turning it over and around. (% CARLINSAYS: use past tense?) We are looking forward to a better look , holding all of the stories of people looking at people in mind, holding terminals and keyboards in hand. We sync our breath to the rhythm of our software. We look at this wholistic observation as a way to approach software, as one way to organize engagement with its implications. Observation, and the Enabling of it intensively through data-centric Feedback Mechanisms, is share of the cybernetic spell That underpins present day software production. Our aim was ??to scrutinize this methodology in its many manifestations, including in "observatories" - high cost infrastructures of observation troubled by colonial, imperial, empirical traditions and their problematic divisions of nature and culture. And through scrutiny, what do you think about who gets to watch software (and how) and who is being observed by software (and with what impact)? It is a question of power, one that we answer, at least in part, with critical play. But also with slow pedagogy.

We pick up the word "observation", turning it over and around. We bring it right up to our noses and hold it outstretched to get a better look, holding all of the histories of people looking at other people in mind, holding terminals and keyboards in hand. We sync our breath to the rhythm of our software. We propose holistic observation as a way to approach software, as one way to organize engagement with its implications. Observation, and the enabling of it through intensive data-centric feedback mechanisms, is part of the cybernetic spells that underpin present day software production.

We respond by cargo cult programming 
we name the actors, we reject the hierarchies of knowledge, deflect erasures, 
some call this cargo-culting, we call it method, rejecting their colonial presumption that functionality is the only purpose, and expertise is the only source of knowlede misunderstanding
criteria for inclusion
ritual includsion of code with no real purpose, we reject optimization as the only value 
ritual of shotgun debugging or deep magic
We question the naming of the non functional as unnecessary, we question the description of code as self-explanatory 


Our aim was to scrutinize this methodology in its many manifestations, including in "observatories" -- high cost infrastructures of observation troubled by colonial, imperial, empirical traditions and their problematic divisions of nature and culture. And through scrutiny, we hope to open up a set of questions about who gets to observe software (and how) and who is being observed by software (and with what impact)? It is a question of power, one that we answer, at least in part, with critical play. But also with slow pedagogy.

Together we picked up the word "observation", turning it over and around. We are here to help you get a better look, holding all of the stories of people looking for people in mind, holding terminals and keyboards in hand. We see how to approach the software, how to organize and engage with its implications. Observation, and the enabling of it through intensive data-centric feedback mechanisms, is part of the cybernetic principles that underpin present day software production.


We are techno-galactic as we meet the contemporary paradigms of computation that proudly announce their capability for "scaling up to the universe." We stand here as modest witnesses to the scales of software communities and related political economies that involve and require observation.

This guide offers a set of practical and fantastical tools for the tactical (mis)use of software, empowering/enabling users to resist embedded paradigms and assumptions. It is a collection of methods for approaching software, experiencing its myths and realities, its risks and benefits. Drawing on theories of software and computation developed in academia and elsewhere, we grounded our methods in hands-on exercises and experiments that you now can try at home. This Guide to Techno-Galactic Software Observation offers methods developed in and inspired by the context of software production, hacker culture, software studies, computer science research, Free Software communities, privacy activism, and artistic practice. It invites you to experiment with ways to stay with the trouble of software. Come join us at the edge of the universe, on the metro platform, at your kitchen table, as we mark and measure critical distances from and entanglements with the seemingly endless software systems that surround us.

The techno-galactic software survival guide was collectively produced as an outcome of the Techno-Galactic Software Observatory.

Remaining thoughts/notes for inspiration:
You may want to just throw all your devices away, but before you do so, wouldn't you want to, for once poke them back?
You may think about retreating to a wooden cabin, and live a software-free life, but even then, do you think you could manage without talking about your past software troubles.
And, how about those drawings at the nearby cave, that look eerily similar to an ancient flowchart, you think you can just ignore its poetry?

kostas axelos, planetary interlude, maybe some bits fit with the intro?:

%  We open ourselves to abysses and we are swallowed up in sys-
%  tems and totalizations - for these are fragments and segments of
%  "totality" which establish themselves as total and/or partial totali-
%  tarisms - without foreseeing what might be the home, the house, the
%  habitat of living, thinking man, an unfinished, unfinishable being in a
%  history which is equally so, neither a shell stuck fast to a rock, nor a
%  simple nomad or vagabond. Mortals wish for the familiar and for
%  adventure, the known and the unknown, undecided as to who decides
%  and to what he decides, chosen rather than choosing. Since they are
%  unable to be their own master, they allow themselves to be fixed,
%  tossed about, carried away, scattered and put to flight, incapable of
%  choosing - if choice there be - between success in and in relation to
%  the world, and the World. All this does not constitute an error; wan-
%  dering (errance) commands it. 
 Galactic irony is watching us. 
%  Dream of a shadow and dispenser of light, conquistador and
%  deserter of the World, pawn and pioneer, man sets out to conquer
%  the stars and he ploughs the sea. The assault he launches against the
%  astral earth and against the celestial stars is not without disaster.
 Whether he delves into analysis and disintegration -- since he needs
 analyses, concrete and tangible solutions and experimentations -- or
 whether he plunges into syntheses -- since the abstracting power and
 the ungraspable attract him equally --, as precisely and as far as he
 may cast his nets, what his nets catch and what passes through them
 communicate. Never quite awake and never quite beclouded, will we
 learn to live and to see beings and things simultaneously from close
 up and far away, large and small, in their and in our wandering
 (errance), in the great World which is at the same time small, where
 there are no victors - would there be vanquished?

## The Techno-Galactic Software Observatory

In the summer of 2017, thirty or so people gathered in Brussels to explore practices of proximate critique with and of software in the context of a worksession entitled "Techno-Galactic Software Observatory".[^]{Worksessions are intensive transdisciplinary moments, organised twice a year by Constant. They aim to provide conditions for participants with different experiences and capabilities to temporarily link their practice and to  develop ideas, prototypes and  research projects together. For the worksessions, primarily Free, Libre and Open Source software is used and material that is available under Open Content Licenses.} The worksession called for software-curious people of all kinds to ask questions about software. The intuition behind such a call was that developing different types of engagement requires a heterogeneous group of participants with different levels of expertise,  skill and background. During three sessions that were two days each, participants collectively inspected the space-time of computation and probed the universe of hardware-software separations through excursions, exercises and conversations. They tried out various perspectives and methods to look at the larger picture of software as a concept, as a practice, and as a set of techniques.

The first two days of The Techno-Galactic Software Observatory included visits to the Musée de l'Informatique Pionnière en Belgique [^]{http://www.nam-ip.be} in Namur and the Computermuseum KULeuven[^]{http://etwie.be/database/actor/computermuseum-ku-leuven}. Surrounded by these collections of historical ’numerical artefacts’, we started considering software in a long-term context (% CARLINSAYS: Do we mean a long historical context or longue duree or something else?). The museum visits provided an occasion to reflect on the conditions of software's appearance (% CARLINSAYS: appearances?) and to take on current-day questions from a genealogical perspective. What is software? How did it appear as a concept, in what industrial and governmental circumstances? What happens to the material conditions of its production (minerals, factory labor, hardware) when it evaporates into a cloud?

The second two days were spent focusing on the space-time dimension of IT development. The way computer programs and operating systems are manufactured has changed tremendously over the last seventy years, as has its production times and places. From military labs to the mega-corporation cubicles to the open-space freelancer utopia, what ruptures and continuities can be traced in the production, deployment, maintenance and destruction of software? From time-sharing to user-space partitions and containerization, what separations were and are at work? Where and when is software made today?

The last two days at the Techno-Galactic Software Observatory were dedicated to observation and its consequences. The development of software encompasses a series of practices whose evocative names are increasingly familiar: feedback, report, probe, audit, inspect, scan, diagnose, explore, test. What are the systems of knowledge and power within which these activities take place, and what other types of observation are possible? As a practical set for our investigations, we set up a walk-in clinic on the 25th floor of the World Trade Center, where users and developers could arrive with software-questions of all kinds.

## The Walk-in Clinic (% CARLINSAYS: I think this title should go below the description of the walk-in clinic as the last two days of the observatory worksession and should come instead right above the invitation to the clinic so I have moved it there)

> Do you suffer from the disappearance of your software into the cloud,
> feel oppressed by unequal user privilege, or experience the torment of
> software-ransom of any sort?
> Bring your devices and interfaces to the World Trade Center!
> With the help of a clear and in-depth session, at the Techno-Galactic
> Walk-In Clinic we guarantee immediate results.
> The  Walk-In Clinic provides free hands-on observations to software
> curious  people of all kinds. A wide range of professional and amateur 
> practitioners will provide you with Software-as-a-Critique-as-a-Service
> on the spot. Available services range from immediate interface critique, 
> collaborative code inspection, data dowsing, various forms of network
> analyses, unusability testing, identification of unknown viruses,
> risk assessment, opening of black-boxes and more.
> Free software observations provided.
> Last intake at 16:45.

(% CARLINSAYS: I would suggest switching the order of these pages so the intake form is first and the list of services poster is second. It also seems important to make sure that the two page list of services poster for the clinic is printed on pages that are facing each other. If they are already set to do that then maybe nix my suggestion of moving the intake form up, but if they are not then that would be one way to shift the pages to make that happen.)
