A spectre is haunting the galaxy. No matter where you happen to be, if you are looking at the worlds around you, there is software running somewhere in the background. Look! There it is, looking right back at you. Be it your phone screen or a passing satellite, software's observation feels complete. Or, is it? The techno-galactic software survival guide that you are reading right now turns this image of a totally observed world on its head, and sets it dancing.

With the rise of online services, the use of software has increasingly been knitted into the production of software, even while the rhetoric, rights and procedures continue to suggest that use and production constitute separate realms. This knitting together and its corresponding disavowal has an effect on the way software is used and produced that radically alters its operative role in society. The shifts ripple across galaxies, through social structures, working conditions and personal relations, resulting in a profusion of apparatuses aspiring to be seamless while optimizing and monetizing individual and collective flows of information in line with the interests of a handful of actors. The diffusion of software services affects the personal, in the form of intensified identity shaping and self-management. It also affects the public, as more and more libraries, universities and public infrastructures as well as the management of public life rely on "solutions" provided by private companies. Centralizing data flows in the clouds, services blur the last traces of the thin line that separates bio- from necro-politics.

Given how fast these changes resonate and reproduce, there is a growing urgency to engage in a critique of software that goes beyond taking a distance, and that deals with the fact that we are inevitably already entangled. How can we interact, intervene, respond and think with software? What approaches can allow us to recognize the agency of different actors, their ways of functioning and their politics? What methods of observation enable critical inquiry and affirmative discord? What techniques can we apply to resurface software where it has melted into the infrastructure and into the everyday? How can we remember that software is always at work, especially where it is designed to disappear into the background?

We pick up the word "observation", turning it over and around. We bring it right up to our noses and hold it outstretched to get a better look, holding all of the histories of people looking at other people in mind, holding terminals and keyboards in hand. We regard observation as a way to approach software, as one way to organize engagement with its implications. Observation, and the enabling of it through intensive data-centric feedback mechanisms, is part of  the cybernetic principles that underpin present day software production. Our aim was to scrutinize this methodology in its many manifestations, including in "observatories" -- high cost infrastructures of observation troubled by colonial, imperial, empirical traditions and their problematic divisions of nature and culture. And through scrutiny, we hope to open up a set of questions about who gets to observe software (and how) and who is being observed by software (and with what impact)? It is a question of power, one that we answer, at least in part, with critical play. But also with slow pedagogy.

Together we picked up the word "observation", turning it over and around. We brought it right up to our noses and held it outstretched to get a better look, holding all of the histories of people looking at other people in mind, holding terminals and keyboards in hand. We regarded observation as a way to approach software, as one way to organize engagement with its implications. Observation, and the enabling of it through intensive data-centric feedback mechanisms, is part of  the cybernetic principles that underpin present day software production.


We are techno-galactic as we meet the contemporary paradigms of computation that proudly announce their capability for "scaling up to the universe." We stand here as modest witnesses to the scales of software communities and related political economies that involve and require observation.

This guide offers a set of practical and fantastical tools for the tactical (mis)use of software, empowering/enabling users to resist embedded paradigms and assumptions. It is a collection of methods for approaching software, experiencing its myths and realities, its risks and benefits. Drawing on theories of software and computation developed in academia and elsewhere, we grounded our methods in hands-on exercises and experiments that you now can try at home. This Guide to Techno-Galactic Software Observation offers methods developed in and inspired by the context of software production, hacker culture, software studies, computer science research, Free Software communities, privacy activism, and artistic practice. It invites you to experiment with ways to stay with the trouble of software. Come join us at the edge of the universe, on the metro platform, at your kitchen table, as we mark and measure critical distances from and entanglements with the seemingly endless software systems that surround us.

The techno-galactic software survival guide was collectively produced as an outcome of the Techno-Galactic Software Observatory.

Remaining thoughts/notes for inspiration:
You may want to just throw all your devices away, but before you do so, wouldn't you want to, for once poke them back?
You may think about retreating to a natural reserve, and live a software free life, but even then, do you think you could manage without talking about your past software troubles.
And, how about those drawings at the nearby cave, that look eerily similar to an ancient flowchart, you think you can just ignore its poetry?

## The Techno-Galactic Software Observatory

In the summer of 2017, around thirty people gathered in Brussels to explore practices of proximate critique with and of software in the context of a worksession entitled "Techno-Galactic Software Observatory".[^]{Worksessions are intensive transdisciplinary moments, organised twice a year by Constant. They aim to provide conditions for participants with different experiences and capabilities to temporarily link their practice and to  develop ideas, prototypes and  research projects together. For the worksessions, primarily Free, Libre and Open Source software is used and material that is available under Open Content Licenses.} The worksession called for software-curious people of all kinds to ask questions about software. The intuition behind such a call was that different types of engagement requires a heterogeneous group of participants with different levels of expertise,  skill and background. During three sessions of two days, participants collectively inspected the space-time of computation and probed the universe of hardware-software separations through excursions, exercises and conversations. They tried out various perspectives and methods to look at the larger picture of software as a concept, as a practice, and as a set of techniques.

The first two days of The Techno-Galactic Software Observatory included visits to the Musée de l'Informatique Pionnière en Belgique [^]{http://www.nam-ip.be} in Namur and the Computermuseum KULeuven[^]{http://www.etwie.be/database/actor/computermuseum-ku-leuven}. In the surroundings of these collections of historical ’numerical artefacts’, we started viewing software in a long-term context. It was an occasion to reflect on the conditions of its appearance, and allowed us to take on current-day questions from a genealogical perspective. What is software? How did it appear as a concept, in what industrial and governmental circumstances? What happens to the material conditions of its production (minerals, factory labor, hardware) when it evaporates into a cloud?

The second two days we focused on the space-time dimension of IT development. The way computer programs and operating systems are manufactured changed tremendously through time, and so did its production times and places. From military labs via the mega-corporation cubicles to the open-space freelancer utopia, what ruptures and continuities can be traced in the production, deployment, maintenance and destruction of software? From time-sharing to user-space partitions and containerization, what separations were and are at work? Where and when is software made today?

## The Walk-in Clinic

The last two days at the Techno-galactic software observatory were dedicated to observation and its consequences. The development of software encompasses a series of practices whose evocative names are increasingly familiar: feedback, report, probe, audit, inspect, scan, diagnose, explore, test ... What are the systems of knowledge and power within which these activities take place, and what other types of observation are possible? As a practical set for our investigations, we set up a walk-in clinic on the 25th floor of the World Trade Center, where users and developers could arrive with software-questions of all kinds.

> Do you suffer from the disappearance of your software into the cloud,
> feel oppressed by unequal user privilege, or experience the torment of
> software-ransom of any sort?
> Bring your devices and interfaces to the World Trade Center!
> With the help of a clear and in-depth session, at the Techno-Galactic
> Walk-In Clinic we guarantee immediate results.
> The  Walk-In Clinic provides free hands-on observations to software
> curious  people of all kinds. A wide range of professional and amateur 
> practitioners will provide you with Software-as-a-Critique-as-a-Service
> on the spot. Available services range from immediate interface critique, 
> collaborative code inspection, data dowsing, various forms of network
> analyses, unusability testing, identification of unknown viruses,
> risk assessment, opening of black-boxes and more.
> Free software observations provided.
> Last intake at 16:45.
