% METHOD: Setup a Relational software observatory consultancy (RSOC)
% REMEMBER: - 

* Collectivise research around hacking to save time.
* Self-articulate software needs as your own Operating (system) perspective.
* Change the lens by looking to software through a time perspective.

% WHAT: By paying a visit to our ethnomethodology interview practice youâ€™ll learn to observe software from different angles / perspectives. Our practionners passion is to make the "what is the relation to software" discussion into a service.
% HOW: Reading the signs. Considering the everchanging nature of software development and use and its vast impact on globalized societies, it is necessary to recognize some of  the issues of how software is (often) either passively-perceived or actively-observed, without an articulation of the relations. We offer a method to read the signs of the relational aspect of software observance. It's a crucial aspect of our guide. It will give you another view on software that will shape your ability to survive any kind of software disaster.

**Possible/anticipated user profiles**

**...meAsHardwareOwnerSoftwareUSER:**

"I did not own a computer personally until very very late as I did not enjoy gaming as a kid or had interest in spending much time behind PC beyond work (and work  computer). My first was hence  I think in 2005 and it was a SGI  workstation that was the computer of the year 2000 (cost 10.000USD)  and I got it for around 300USD. Proprietary drivers for unified  graphics+RAM were never released, so it remained a software dead-end in  gorgeous blue curved chassis http://www.sgidepot.co.uk/sgidepot/pics/vwdocs.jpg" 

**...meAsSoftwareCONSUMER:**

"I payed/purchased  software only twice  in my life (totalling less then 25eur), as I could access most  commercial software as widely pirated in Balkans and later had more  passion for FLOSS anyway, this made me relate to software as material to  exchange and work it, rather than commodity goods I could or not  afford."

**...meAsSoftwareINVESTOR:**

"I did it as both of those apps  were niche products in early beta (one was Jeeper Elvis, real-time-non-linear-video-editor for BeOS) that failed to reach market,  but I think I would likely do it again and only in that mode  (supporting the bleeding edge and off-stream work), but maybe with more  than 25eur." 

**...meAsSoftwareUserOfOS:**

"I would spend most of 80s  ignoring computers, 90ties figuring out software from high-end to  low-end, starting with OSF/DecAlpha and SunOS, than IRIX and MacOS,  finally Win 95/98 SE, that permanently pushed me into niches (of montly  LINUX distro install fests, or even QNX/Solaris experiments and finally  BeOS use)."

**...meAsSoftwareWEBSURFER:**

"I got used to websurfing in  more than 15 windows on UNIX systems and never got used to less than  that ever since, furthermore with addition of more browser options this  number only multiplied (always wondered if my first system was Windows  3.11 - would I be a more focused person and how would that form my relations to browser windows>tabs)."

**...meAsSoftwareUserOfPropertarySoftware:**

"I signed one NDA contract in person on the paper and with ink on a  rainy day while stopping of at trainstaion in north Germany for the  software that was later to be pulled out of market due to problematic  licencing agreement (intuitivly I knew it was wrong) - it had too much  unprofessional pixeleted edges in its graphics.

**...meAsSoftwareUserOfDatingWebsites:**

"I got one feature request implemented by a prominent dating website  (to search profiles by language they speak), however I was never  publicly acknowledged (though I tried to make use of it few times), that  made our relations feel a bit exploitative and underappreciated. "

**...meAsSoftwareUserTryingToGoPRO:**

"my only two attempts to get into the software company failed as they  insisted on full time commitments. Later I found out ones were  intimidated in interview and other gave it to a person that negotiated  to work part time with friend!  My relation to professionalism is likely  equally complex and pervert as one to the software."
