Proprietary drivers for unified  graphics+RAM were never released, so it remained a software dead-end in  gorgeous blue curved chassis http://www.sgidepot.co.uk/sgidepot/pics/vwdocs.jpg\" \n\n% MEAS: SoftwareCONSUMER\n\"I payed/purchased  software only twice  in my life (totalling less then 25eur), as I could access most  commercial software as widely pirated in Balkans and later had more  passion for FLOSS anyway, this made me relate to software as material to  exchange and work with, rather than commodity goods I could or could not afford.\"\n\n% MEAS: SoftwareINVESTOR\n\"I did it as both of those apps  were niche products in early beta (one was Jeeper Elvis, real-time-non-linear-video-editor for BeOS) that failed to reach market,  but I think I would likely do it again and only in that mode  (supporting the bleeding edge and off-stream work), but maybe with more  than 25eur.\" \n\n% MEAS: SoftwareUserOfOS\n\"I would spend most of 80s  ignoring computers, 90ties figuring out software from high-end to  low-end, starting with OSF/DecAlpha and SunOS, than IRIX and MacOS,  finally Win 95/98 SE, that permanently pushed me into niches (of montly  LINUX distro install fests, or even QNX/Solaris experiments and finally  BeOS use).\"\n\n% MEAS: SoftwareWEBSURFER\n\"I got used to websurfing in  more than 15 windows on UNIX systems and never got used to less than  that ever since, furthermore with addition of more browser options this  number only multiplied (always wondered if my first system was Windows  3.11 - would I be a more focused person and how would that form my relations to browser windows>tabs).\"\n\n% MEAS: SoftwareUserOfProprietarySoftware\n\"I signed one NDA contract in person on the paper and with ink on a  rainy day while stopping of at trainstaion in north Germany for the software that was later to be pulled out of market due to problematic  licencing agreement (intuitively I knew it was wrong) - it had too much unprofessional pixeleted edges in its graphics.\n\n% MEAS: SoftwareUserOfDatingWebsites\n\"I got one feature request implemented by a prominent dating website  (to search profiles by language they speak), however I was never  publicly acknowledged (though I tried to make use of it few times), that  made our relations feel a bit exploitative and underappreciated. \"\n\n% MEAS: SoftwareUserTryingToGoPRO\n\"my only two attempts to get into the software company failed as they  insisted on full time commitments. Later I found out ones were  intimidated in interview and other gave it to a person that negotiated  to work part time with friend!  My relation to professionalism is likely  equally complex and pervert as one to the software.\"\n\n% Rsoc - Relational software observatory Consultancy service\n\n\n%!NEWPAGE:\n\n% http://gallery.constantvzw.org/index.php/Techno-Galactic-Software-Observatory/IMG_0892\n% TODO: tgsoimages.svg foilpeople\n\n## Case study : W. W.\n\n% WWAS: ExperiencedAdventerousUSER: experiments with software every two days as she uses FLOSS and GNU/Linux, cares the most for malleability of the software - as a result she has big expectations of flexibility even in software category which is quite conventional and stability focused like file-hosting. \n\n% WWAS: AnInevstorInSoftware: paid compiled version of FLOSS audio software 5 years ago as she is supportive of economy and work around production, maintainance and support, but she also used closed hardware/software where she had to agree on licences she finds unfair, but then she was hacking it in order to use it as an expert - when she had time.  \n\n% WWAS: CommunicationSoftwareUSER: she is not using commercial social networks, so she is very concious of information transfers and time relations, but has no strong media/format/design focus. \n\n% Q: What is your first recollection of software use?   \n% A: MS-DOS in 1990 at school -- I was 15 or 16.

It was Linux Mint something.\n\n% Q: Do you know about scripting?  \n% A: I do automating scripts for any operation I have to doi several times like format conversion.\n\n% Q: Can you talk about your most technical encounter with your computer / telephone?  \n% A: I've tried to root it. But i didn't succeed.\n\n% Q: How much time do you wish to spend on such activities like hacking, rooting your device?  \n% A: Hours. You should take your time.\n\n% Q: Did you ever sign licence agreement you were not agree with? How does that affect you?  \n% A: This is the first thing your when you have a phone. It's obey or die.\n\n% Q: What is the software feature you care for the most?  \n% A: Malleability. Different ways to approach a problem, a challenge, an issue.\n\n% Q: Do you use any free software?  \n% A: Yes.

My first was hence  I think in 2005 and it was a SGI  workstation that was the computer of the year 2000 (cost 10.000USD)  and I got it for around 300USD. Proprietary drivers for unified  graphics+RAM were never released, so it remained a software dead-end in  gorgeous blue curved chassis http://www.sgidepot.co.uk/sgidepot/pics/vwdocs.jpg\" \n\n**...meAsSoftwareCONSUMER:**\n\n\"I payed/purchased  software only twice  in my life (totalling less then 25eur), as I could access most  commercial software as widely pirated in Balkans and later had more  passion for FLOSS anyway, this made me relate to software as material to  exchange and work it, rather than commodity goods I could or not  afford.\"\n\n**...meAsSoftwareINVESTOR:**\n\n\"I did it as both of those apps  were niche products in early beta (one was Jeeper Elvis, real-time-non-linear-video-editor for BeOS) that failed to reach market,  but I think I would likely do it again and only in that mode  (supporting the bleeding edge and off-stream work), but maybe with more  than 25eur.\" \n\n**...meAsSoftwareUserOfOS:**\n\n\"I would spend most of 80s  ignoring computers, 90ties figuring out software from high-end to  low-end, starting with OSF/DecAlpha and SunOS, than IRIX and MacOS,  finally Win 95/98 SE, that permanently pushed me into niches (of montly  LINUX distro install fests, or even QNX/Solaris experiments and finally  BeOS use).\"\n\n**...meAsSoftwareWEBSURFER:**\n\n\"I got used to websurfing in  more than 15 windows on UNIX systems and never got used to less than  that ever since, furthermore with addition of more browser options this  number only multiplied (always wondered if my first system was Windows  3.11 - would I be a more focused person and how would that form my relations to browser windows>tabs).\"\n\n**...meAsSoftwareUserOfPropertarySoftware:**\n\n\"I signed one NDA contract in person on the paper and with ink on a  rainy day while stopping of at trainstaion in north Germany for the  software that was later to be pulled out of market due to problematic  licencing agreement (intuitivly I knew it was wrong) - it had too much  unprofessional pixeleted edges in its graphics.\n\n**...meAsSoftwareUserOfDatingWebsites:**\n\n\"I got one feature request implemented by a prominent dating website  (to search profiles by language they speak), however I was never  publicly acknowledged (though I tried to make use of it few times), that  made our relations feel a bit exploitative and underappreciated. \"\n\n**...meAsSoftwareUserTryingToGoPRO:**\n\n\"my only two attempts to get into the software company failed as they  insisted on full time commitments.

Our practionners passion is to make the \"what is the relation to software\" discussion into a service.\n% HOW: Reading the signs. Considering the everchanging nature of software development and use and its vast impact on globalized societies, it is necessary to recognize some of  the issues of how software is (often) either passively-perceived or actively-observed, without an articulation of the relations. We offer a method to read the signs of the relational aspect of software observance. It's a crucial aspect of our guide.

Proprietary drivers for unified  graphics+RAM were never released, so it remained a software dead-end in  gorgeous blue curved chassis http://www.sgidepot.co.uk/sgidepot/pics/vwdocs.jpg\" \n\n**...meAsSoftwareCONSUMER:**\n\n\"I payed/purchased  software only twice  in my life (totalling less then 25eur), as I could access most  commercial software as widely pirated in Balkans and later had more  passion for FLOSS anyway, this made me relate to software as material to  exchange and work it, rather than commodity goods I could or not  afford.\"\n\n**...meAsSoftwareINVESTOR:**\n\n\"I did it as both of those apps  were niche products in early beta (one was Jeeper Elvis, real-time-non-linear-video-editor for BeOS) that failed to reach market,  but I think I would likely do it again and only in that mode  (supporting the bleeding edge and off-stream work), but maybe with more  than 25eur.\" \n\n**...meAsSoftwareUserOfOS:**\n\n\"I would spend most of 80s  ignoring computers, 90ties figuring out software from high-end to  low-end, starting with OSF/DecAlpha and SunOS, than IRIX and MacOS,  finally Win 95/98 SE, that permanently pushed me into niches (of montly  LINUX distro install fests, or even QNX/Solaris experiments and finally  BeOS use).\"\n\n**...meAsSoftwareWEBSURFER:**\n\n\"I got used to websurfing in  more than 15 windows on UNIX systems and never got used to less than  that ever since, furthermore with addition of more browser options this  number only multiplied (always wondered if my first system was Windows  3.11 - would I be a more focused person and how would that form my relations to browser windows>tabs).\"\n\n**...meAsSoftwareUserOfPropertarySoftware:**\n\n\"I signed one NDA contract in person on the paper and with ink on a  rainy day while stopping of at trainstaion in north Germany for the  software that was later to be pulled out of market due to problematic  licencing agreement (intuitivly I knew it was wrong) - it had too much  unprofessional pixeleted edges in its graphics.\n\n**...meAsSoftwareUserOfDatingWebsites:**\n\n\"I got one feature request implemented by a prominent dating website  (to search profiles by language they speak), however I was never  publicly acknowledged (though I tried to make use of it few times), that  made our relations feel a bit exploitative and underappreciated. \"\n\n**...meAsSoftwareUserTryingToGoPRO:**\n\n\"my only two attempts to get into the software company failed as they  insisted on full time commitments. Later I found out ones were  intimidated in interview and other gave it to a person that negotiated  to work part time with friend!  My relation to professionalism is likely  equally complex and pervert as one to the software.\"\n\n% Rsoc - Relational software observatory Consultancy service\n\n% NEWPAGE:\n\n## Case study : W.

My first was hence I think in 2005 and it was a SGI workstation that was the computer of the year 2000 (cost 10.000USD)  and I got it for around 300USD. Proprietary drivers for unified  graphics+RAM were never released, so it remained a software dead-end in  gorgeous blue curved chassis http://www.sgidepot.co.uk/sgidepot/pics/vwdocs.jpg\" \n\n**...meAsSoftwareCONSUMER:**\n\n\"I payed/purchased  software only twice  in my life (totalling less then 25eur), as I could access most  commercial software as widely pirated in Balkans and later had more  passion for FLOSS anyway, this made me relate to software as material to  exchange and work with, rather than commodity goods I could or could not afford.\"\n\n**...meAsSoftwareINVESTOR:**\n\n\"I did it as both of those apps  were niche products in early beta (one was Jeeper Elvis, real-time-non-linear-video-editor for BeOS) that failed to reach market,  but I think I would likely do it again and only in that mode  (supporting the bleeding edge and off-stream work), but maybe with more  than 25eur.\" \n\n**...meAsSoftwareUserOfOS:**\n\n\"I would spend most of 80s  ignoring computers, 90ties figuring out software from high-end to  low-end, starting with OSF/DecAlpha and SunOS, than IRIX and MacOS,  finally Win 95/98 SE, that permanently pushed me into niches (of montly  LINUX distro install fests, or even QNX/Solaris experiments and finally  BeOS use).\"\n\n**...meAsSoftwareWEBSURFER:**\n\n\"I got used to websurfing in  more than 15 windows on UNIX systems and never got used to less than  that ever since, furthermore with addition of more browser options this  number only multiplied (always wondered if my first system was Windows  3.11 - would I be a more focused person and how would that form my relations to browser windows>tabs).\"\n\n**...meAsSoftwareUserOfPropertarySoftware:**\n\n\"I signed one NDA contract in person on the paper and with ink on a  rainy day while stopping of at trainstaion in north Germany for the software that was later to be pulled out of market due to problematic  licencing agreement (intuitively I knew it was wrong) - it had too much  unprofessional pixeleted edges in its graphics.\n\n**...meAsSoftwareUserOfDatingWebsites:**\n\n\"I got one feature request implemented by a prominent dating website  (to search profiles by language they speak), however I was never  publicly acknowledged (though I tried to make use of it few times), that  made our relations feel a bit exploitative and underappreciated. \"\n\n**...meAsSoftwareUserTryingToGoPRO:**\n\n\"my only two attempts to get into the software company failed as they  insisted on full time commitments.

My first was hence I think in 2005 and it was a SGI workstation that was the computer of the year 2000 (cost 10.000USD)  and I got it for around 300USD. Proprietary drivers for unified  graphics+RAM were never released, so it remained a software dead-end in  gorgeous blue curved chassis http://www.sgidepot.co.uk/sgidepot/pics/vwdocs.jpg\" \n\n**...meAsSoftwareCONSUMER:**\n\n\"I payed/purchased  software only twice  in my life (totalling less then 25eur), as I could access most  commercial software as widely pirated in Balkans and later had more  passion for FLOSS anyway, this made me relate to software as material to  exchange and work with, rather than commodity goods I could or could not afford.\"\n\n**...meAsSoftwareINVESTOR:**\n\n\"I did it as both of those apps  were niche products in early beta (one was Jeeper Elvis, real-time-non-linear-video-editor for BeOS) that failed to reach market,  but I think I would likely do it again and only in that mode  (supporting the bleeding edge and off-stream work), but maybe with more  than 25eur.\" \n\n**...meAsSoftwareUserOfOS:**\n\n\"I would spend most of 80s  ignoring computers, 90ties figuring out software from high-end to  low-end, starting with OSF/DecAlpha and SunOS, than IRIX and MacOS,  finally Win 95/98 SE, that permanently pushed me into niches (of montly  LINUX distro install fests, or even QNX/Solaris experiments and finally  BeOS use).\"\n\n**...meAsSoftwareWEBSURFER:**\n\n\"I got used to websurfing in  more than 15 windows on UNIX systems and never got used to less than  that ever since, furthermore with addition of more browser options this  number only multiplied (always wondered if my first system was Windows  3.11 - would I be a more focused person and how would that form my relations to browser windows>tabs).\"\n\n**...meAsSoftwareUserOfPropertarySoftware:**\n\n\"I signed one NDA contract in person on the paper and with ink on a  rainy day while stopping of at trainstaion in north Germany for the software that was later to be pulled out of market due to problematic  licencing agreement (intuitively I knew it was wrong) - it had too much unprofessional pixeleted edges in its graphics.\n\n**...meAsSoftwareUserOfDatingWebsites:**\n\n\"I got one feature request implemented by a prominent dating website  (to search profiles by language they speak), however I was never  publicly acknowledged (though I tried to make use of it few times), that  made our relations feel a bit exploitative and underappreciated. \"\n\n**...meAsSoftwareUserTryingToGoPRO:**\n\n\"my only two attempts to get into the software company failed as they  insisted on full time commitments. Later I found out ones were  intimidated in interview and other gave it to a person that negotiated  to work part time with friend!  My relation to professionalism is likely  equally complex and pervert as one to the software.\"\n\n% Rsoc - Relational software observatory Consultancy service\n\n% NEWPAGE:\n\n% http://gallery.constantvzw.org/index.php/Techno-Galactic-Software-Observatory/IMG_0892\n% SHOW: tgsoimages.svg foilpeople\n\n## Case study : W.

My first was hence I think in 2005 and it was a SGI workstation that was the computer of the year 2000 (cost 10.000USD)  and I got it for around 300USD. Proprietary drivers for unified  graphics+RAM were never released, so it remained a software dead-end in  gorgeous blue curved chassis http://www.sgidepot.co.uk/sgidepot/pics/vwdocs.jpg\" \n\n**...meAsSoftwareCONSUMER:**\n\n\"I payed/purchased  software only twice  in my life (totalling less then 25eur), as I could access most  commercial software as widely pirated in Balkans and later had more  passion for FLOSS anyway, this made me relate to software as material to  exchange and work with, rather than commodity goods I could or could not afford.\"\n\n**...meAsSoftwareINVESTOR:**\n\n\"I did it as both of those apps  were niche products in early beta (one was Jeeper Elvis, real-time-non-linear-video-editor for BeOS) that failed to reach market,  but I think I would likely do it again and only in that mode  (supporting the bleeding edge and off-stream work), but maybe with more  than 25eur.\" \n\n**...meAsSoftwareUserOfOS:**\n\n\"I would spend most of 80s  ignoring computers, 90ties figuring out software from high-end to  low-end, starting with OSF/DecAlpha and SunOS, than IRIX and MacOS,  finally Win 95/98 SE, that permanently pushed me into niches (of montly  LINUX distro install fests, or even QNX/Solaris experiments and finally  BeOS use).\"\n\n**...meAsSoftwareWEBSURFER:**\n\n\"I got used to websurfing in  more than 15 windows on UNIX systems and never got used to less than  that ever since, furthermore with addition of more browser options this  number only multiplied (always wondered if my first system was Windows  3.11 - would I be a more focused person and how would that form my relations to browser windows>tabs).\"\n\n**...meAsSoftwareUserOfPropertarySoftware:**\n\n\"I signed one NDA contract in person on the paper and with ink on a  rainy day while stopping of at trainstaion in north Germany for the software that was later to be pulled out of market due to problematic  licencing agreement (intuitively I knew it was wrong) - it had too much unprofessional pixeleted edges in its graphics.\n\n**...meAsSoftwareUserOfDatingWebsites:**\n\n\"I got one feature request implemented by a prominent dating website  (to search profiles by language they speak), however I was never  publicly acknowledged (though I tried to make use of it few times), that  made our relations feel a bit exploitative and underappreciated. \"\n\n**...meAsSoftwareUserTryingToGoPRO:**\n\n\"my only two attempts to get into the software company failed as they  insisted on full time commitments. Later I found out ones were  intimidated in interview and other gave it to a person that negotiated  to work part time with friend!  My relation to professionalism is likely  equally complex and pervert as one to the software.\"\n\n% Rsoc - Relational software observatory Consultancy service\n\n\n% NEWPAGE:\n\n% http://gallery.constantvzw.org/index.php/Techno-Galactic-Software-Observatory/IMG_0892\n% TODO: tgsoimages.svg foilpeople\n\n## Case study : W.

My first was hence I think in 2005 and it was a SGI workstation that was the computer of the year 2000 (cost 10.000USD)  and I got it for around 300USD. Proprietary drivers for unified  graphics+RAM were never released, so it remained a software dead-end in  gorgeous blue curved chassis http://www.sgidepot.co.uk/sgidepot/pics/vwdocs.jpg\" \n\n**...meAsSoftwareCONSUMER:**\n\n\"I payed/purchased  software only twice  in my life (totalling less then 25eur), as I could access most  commercial software as widely pirated in Balkans and later had more  passion for FLOSS anyway, this made me relate to software as material to  exchange and work with, rather than commodity goods I could or could not afford.\"\n\n**...meAsSoftwareINVESTOR:**\n\n\"I did it as both of those apps  were niche products in early beta (one was Jeeper Elvis, real-time-non-linear-video-editor for BeOS) that failed to reach market,  but I think I would likely do it again and only in that mode  (supporting the bleeding edge and off-stream work), but maybe with more  than 25eur.\" \n\n**...meAsSoftwareUserOfOS:**\n\n\"I would spend most of 80s  ignoring computers, 90ties figuring out software from high-end to  low-end, starting with OSF/DecAlpha and SunOS, than IRIX and MacOS,  finally Win 95/98 SE, that permanently pushed me into niches (of montly  LINUX distro install fests, or even QNX/Solaris experiments and finally  BeOS use).\"\n\n**...meAsSoftwareWEBSURFER:**\n\n\"I got used to websurfing in  more than 15 windows on UNIX systems and never got used to less than  that ever since, furthermore with addition of more browser options this  number only multiplied (always wondered if my first system was Windows  3.11 - would I be a more focused person and how would that form my relations to browser windows>tabs).\"\n\n**...meAsSoftwareUserOfPropertarySoftware:**\n\n\"I signed one NDA contract in person on the paper and with ink on a  rainy day while stopping of at trainstaion in north Germany for the software that was later to be pulled out of market due to problematic  licencing agreement (intuitively I knew it was wrong) - it had too much unprofessional pixeleted edges in its graphics.\n\n**...meAsSoftwareUserOfDatingWebsites:**\n\n\"I got one feature request implemented by a prominent dating website  (to search profiles by language they speak), however I was never  publicly acknowledged (though I tried to make use of it few times), that  made our relations feel a bit exploitative and underappreciated. \"\n\n**...meAsSoftwareUserTryingToGoPRO:**\n\n\"my only two attempts to get into the software company failed as they  insisted on full time commitments. Later I found out ones were  intimidated in interview and other gave it to a person that negotiated  to work part time with friend!  My relation to professionalism is likely  equally complex and pervert as one to the software.\"\n\n% Rsoc - Relational software observatory Consultancy service\n\n\n% NEWPAGE:\n\n% http://gallery.constantvzw.org/index.php/Techno-Galactic-Software-Observatory/IMG_0892\n% TODO: tgsoimages.svg foilpeople\n\n## Case study : W.

METHOD: Setup a Relational software observatory consultancy (RSOC)\n% WHAT: Ethnomethodological interview\n\n% HOW: Read the signs. Considering the ever changing nature of software development and use, and its vast impact on globalized societies, it is necessary to recognize the problems arising from software (often) being either passively-perceived or actively-observed without an articulation of the relations. Reading the signs of the relational aspect of software observance will give you another view on software that will shape your ability to survive any kind of software disaster.\n\n\n\n% ![Reading the signs.

It will help you to shape your own relation to software. You will be able to construct your own taxonomy and classification of software users which is necessary in order to find a means of rescue in case of a software catastrophe. \n\n### User Habits\n* What kind of user would you say that you are? \n* What is your most frequently used type of software?\n* How often do you install/experiment/learn new software?\n\n### History\n* What is your first recollection of software use? \n* How often do / when did you last purchase software or pay for a software service?\n\n### Ethics \n* What is the software feature you care about the most?\n* Do you use any free software?    \n  If yes than\n**  do you remember your first attempt at using this software service?

How do you feel about that?\n*  Have you ever read a terms of software service, what about one that is not targeting the American market?\n\n\n\n% **Sample questionnaire results**\n% THESE ARE QUOTES FROM THE FORMS:%\n% ROLEPLAY, SAMPLES OF ANSWERS:\n\n\n\n## Possible/anticipated user profiles\n\n% MEAS: HardwareOwnerSoftwareUSER\nI did not own a computer personally until very very late as I did not enjoy gaming as a kid or had interest in spending much time behind PC beyond work (and work  computer). My first was hence I think in 2005 and it was a SGI workstation that was the computer of the year 2000 (cost 10.000USD)  and I got it for around 300USD. Proprietary drivers for unified  graphics+RAM were never released, so it remained a software dead-end in  gorgeous blue curved chassis http://www.sgidepot.co.uk/sgidepot/pics/vwdocs.jpg\n\n% MEAS: SoftwareCONSUMER\nI payed/purchased  software only twice  in my life (totalling less then 25eur), as I could access most  commercial software as widely pirated in Balkans and later had more  passion for FLOSS anyway, this made me relate to software as material to  exchange and work with, rather than commodity goods I could or could not afford.\n\n% MEAS: SoftwareINVESTOR\nI did it as both of those apps  were niche products in early beta (one was Jeeper Elvis, real-time-non-linear-video-editor for BeOS) that failed to reach market,  but I think I would likely do it again and only in that mode  (supporting the bleeding edge and off-stream work), but maybe with more than 25eur.\n\n% MEAS: SoftwareUserOfOS\nI would spend most of 80s  ignoring computers, 90s figuring out software from high-end to  low-end, starting with OSF/DecAlpha and SunOS, than IRIX and MacOS,  finally Win 95/98 SE, that permanently pushed me into niches (of montly  LINUX distro install fests, or even QNX/Solaris experiments and finally BeOS use).\n\n% MEAS: SoftwareWEBSURFER\nI got used to websurfing in  more than 15 windows on UNIX systems and never got used to less than  that ever since, furthermore with addition of more browser options this  number only multiplied (always wondered if my first system was Windows  3.11 - would I be a more focused person and how would that form my relations to browser windows>tabs).\n\n% MEAS: SoftwareUserOfProprietarySoftware\nI signed one NDA contract in person on the paper and with ink on a  rainy day while stopping of at trainstaion in north Germany for the software that was later to be pulled out of market due to problematic  licencing agreement (intuitively I knew it was wrong) - it had too much unprofessional pixeleted edges in its graphics.\n\n% MEAS: SoftwareUserOfDatingWebsites\nI got one feature request implemented by a prominent dating website  (to search profiles by language they speak), however I was never  publicly acknowledged (though I tried to make use of it few times), that  made our relations feel a bit exploitative and underappreciated.\n\n% MEAS: SoftwareUserTryingToGoPRO\nMy only two attempts to get into the software company failed as they  insisted on full time commitments.
