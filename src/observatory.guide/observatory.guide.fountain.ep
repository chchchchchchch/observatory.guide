Using this foil as room dividers in a room with a changing light, what is hidden or visible will vary throughout the day. So will the need for comfortable silence.\nDisclaimer :  \nSimilar to the last 100 years of western office organisation,  \nthis fountain only has two modes:  \non or off\n\nIf it is on it also offers two options  \ncold water and hot water \n\nThis fountain has been tampered with and has not in any way been approved by a proffesional fountain cleaner. I do urge you to consider this before you take the decision to drink from the fountain. \n\nShould you chose to drink from the fountain, then I urge you to write your name on your cup, in the designated area, for a customised experience of my care for you.\n\nI do want you to be comfortable.\n\n% SHOW: http://observatory.constantvzw.org/documents/mia/mia6.gif\n% SHOW: http://observatory.constantvzw.org/documents/mia/FullSizeRender%2811%29.jpg\n% SHOW: http://observatory.constantvzw.org/documents/mia/IMG_5695.JPG\n% SHOW: http://observatory.constantvzw.org/documents/mia/IMG_5698.JPG\n\n% RELATESTO:\n% SOURCE: Mia Melvaer\n\n","attribs":"+2*1*2+6|2+o+2*1*2+8|1+2+2*1*2+4|1+37+2*1*2+3|1+43+2*1*2+4|1+2+2*1*2+3|1+99+2*1*2+7|1+9u+2*1*2+4|1+2+2*1*2+7|1+2*0|1+1+2*1*2+7|4+2b+26*0|1+1*0+2+13*0+2|l+1yp*0+8|1+1m*0+8|1+24*0+8|1+1q*0+8|2+1r+2*0+9|3+p"},"pool":{"numToAttrib":{"0":["author","a.PRabeGfk5jCXUq8V"],"1":["bold","true"],"2":["underline","true"],"3":["bold",""],"4":["underline",""]},"nextNum":5},"head":65,"chatHead":-1,"publicStatus":false,"passwordHash":null,"savedRevisions":[]},"globalAuthor:a.PRabeGfk5jCXUq8V":{"colorId":"#e267fe","name":"CH","timestamp":1515593615676,"padIDs":"observatory.guide.fountain"}}
