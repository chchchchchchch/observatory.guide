METHOD: Encounter several collections of historical hardware back-to-back\n% REMEMBER:\n% WHAT:\n% HOW: -\n\nThis can be done by identifying one or more computer museums and visit them with little time in-between. Visiting a friend with a large basement and lots of left-over computer equipment can help. Seeing and possibly touching hardware from different contexts (state-administration, business, research, ...), periods of time, cultural contexts (California, Germany, French-speaking Belgium) and price ranges allows you to sense the interactions between hardware and software development.\n\n% WHEN:\n% WHO:\n% URGENCY:\n% NOTE: It's a perfect way to hear people speak about the objects and their contexts, how they worked or not and how objects are linked one with another.  It also shows the economic and cultural aspects of softwares.\n\n% WARNING: **DO NOT FOLD, SPINDLE OR MUTILATE**\n\n% EXAMPLE: Spaghetti Suitcase\n\nAt one point during the demonstration of a Bull computer, the guide revealed the system's \"software\" -- a suitcase sized module with dozens of patch cords. She made the comment that the term \"spaghetti code\" (a derogatory expression about early code usign many \"GOTO\" statments) had its origin in this physical arrangement of code as patchings.\n\nPreserving old hardware in order to observe physical manifestation of software. \nSee software here : we did experienced the incredible possibility of actually touching software.\n\n% SHOW: http://observatory.constantvzw.org/images/wednesday/IMG_20170607_113634_585.jpg\n% SHOW: http://gallery.constantvzw.org/var/resizes/Techno-Galactic-Software-Observatory/IMG_1163.JPG?m=1496916927\n\n\n% EXAMPLE: Playing with the binary.
