                                  \n**You have been using computers since a long time, as you explained us during the tour we had the joy of assisting during the TGSO.**\n**I heard that that until recently, let's say the late 1990's when learning computer programming you had to start by  writing down the program on paper ? ** \n\nIn 1973, i did study computer sciences, it was the second year of the department, here in leuven. At the time computers were mainframes and you did fed them with programms by punch cards. Programing was writing down the program, than you punched it and the next day you get results, mostly errors, that the way it worked at that time. To teach us programing, they used the langage of that time, fortran and some kind of invented assembly langage, it didn't really exist, it was simplified.\n\nMost of the time you did write down your program the teachera and the assistant would have to tell you what is wrong or good, you didn't had much practical experience.\n\n\n**How was it like, tons of pages ?** \n\nNo as an anecdocte, i remember punchcards were a block of papers, we were jealous of the people who came in the computer center with huge stacks of cards. That were really small programs, not complicated one. The fact you had to learn to use the computer from scratch, everything was new, you couldn't rely on previous experiences, everything was new. And to start with small programms was difficult enough. \n\nThat was also the time when the guy who forked the goto (Edsger W. Dijkstra?), i still remember him, i an audience, telling us xxxxxx.\n\nAnd then from 75 on, computers became cheaper and could be bought by departments and smaller entities. And than came the first interactive computer. Still beasts about two cubics meters, costing two millions belgian francs. But it was low enough to allow people to type in directly commands. I started working here in 75 as a researcher, it have evolved continuasly and i saw computer getting cheaper and getting easier to use.The way to use it was simplified, you could start to go to the beast and try it out.\n\nI remember more or less: you did write down the program in Fortran for instance… We always thought in the beginning that it would work and it didn't, so after a turn around you were giving it back to the operator and you have to wait half a day or a night to get the results.\n\n\n**What kind of program you were working on? ** \n\nI remember the first program i had to work on. You got three numbers, you had to make the program decide if you caxn construct a triangle with the numbers being the sides of the triangle.\n\n\n**That took an afternoon to be processed ?** \n\nWell, yeah. You had to imagine how to do it which was also one problem, than you prepare the card with the punching machine and you give it the package of cards to the operator  who was feeeding the computer with the cards. People hathe taks to fed the computers with paper, cards, than disks and it last onto the magnetic disks period.And after anuber of hours you get a listing, a piece of paper, with the results.\n\n**When where you able to record the program onto the machine?**\n\nI think that happens between 75 and 80. After the punching cards which was a way to record the program we had terminals and typewriters burbyou coylds recordnthe programms. Type writers, terminals, we couldn't record the programms.\n\nWe could store onto the computer, IBM had number for ecerything in remember the 33-30 was a magnetic disk. We didn't touch the machines, operators would change the disks, we could only access the typewriter. That was our most direct connexion to the computer. The mainframes were such huge costly beasts that it had operators day and night keeping it busy. Even at night there were two or three guys mounting tapes, dismounting tapes, that kind of stuff.\n\n**When did you stop working with operators?** \n\nSomewhere between 80 and 90. There were still operators at the main computer of the university, but there were small computer so researchers and student can have direct access when needed.\n\n\n**When did you start to work with software sold by others or gived away in order to do your research?** \n\nYou did need an operating system on the mainframe that was delivered by IBM or \nthe constructor delivering the mainframe. When you bought mini computers, which were the  smaller versions of mainframes in most cases you did buy an operating systems, compilers and all the stuff you need to be able to work with all those things. In most cases because the computer sciences department did buy the mini computer from for instance *digital equipment*  a manufactorer of that time but they didn't buy the software from them. It was not open source or free, but you could get Unix and could run it on those digital equipment computers. That is what the computer department of the University of Louvain la Neuve *l'unité d'informatique* , did.","meta":{"author":"a.kqv62Q3nhchdwIuK","timestamp":1518012713703}},"pad:observatory.guide.jean.heuns:revs:127":{"changeset":"Z:4qd<bu|l=le|4-95-2p$","meta":{"author":"a.kqv62Q3nhchdwIuK","timestamp":1518012736903}},"pad:observatory.guide.jean.heuns:revs:128":{"changeset":"Z:4ej>1|l=le*6+1$\"","meta":{"author":"a.kqv62Q3nhchdwIuK","timestamp":1518012833679}},"pad:observatory.guide.jean.heuns:revs:129":{"changeset":"Z:4ek>1|l=le=ax*6+1$\"","meta":{"author":"a.kqv62Q3nhchdwIuK","timestamp":1518012835828}},"pad:observatory.guide.jean.heuns:revs:13":{"changeset":"Z:vf>4|k=k8=3*0+4$HOIW","meta":{"author":"a.PRabeGfk5jCXUq8V","timestamp":1515339060915}},"pad:observatory.guide.jean.heuns:revs:130":{"changeset":"Z:4el<4n|n=we-4n$","meta":{"author":"a.kqv62Q3nhchdwIuK","timestamp":1518012842415}},"pad:observatory.guide.jean.heuns:revs:131":{"changeset":"Z:49y>1|s=xk=bc*6+1$\"","meta":{"author":"a.kqv62Q3nhchdwIuK","timestamp":1518012856690}},"pad:observatory.guide.jean.heuns:revs:132":{"changeset":"Z:49z<1|s=xk=bc-1$","meta":{"author":"a.kqv62Q3nhchdwIuK","timestamp":1518012864003}},"pad:observatory.guide.jean.heuns:revs:133":{"changeset":"Z:49y>a|u=18y=s-8*6+i$Edsger W.

Programing was writing down the program, than you punched it and the next day you get results, mostly errors, that the way it worked at that time. To teach us programing, they used the langage of that time, fortran and some kind of invented assembly langage, it didn't really exist, it was simplified.\"\n\n\n\"I remember punchcards were a block of papers, we were jealous of the people who came in the computer center with huge stacks of cards. That were really small programs, not complicated one. The fact you had to learn to use the computer from scratch, everything was new, you couldn't rely on previous experiences, everything was new. And to start with small programms was difficult enough. \nThat was also the time when Edsger W. Dijkstra who forked the goto... i still remember him, in an audience, giving us a lecture on intuition at the International computing symposium 1977 in Liège on programming: from craft to scientific discipline https://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/EWD/transcriptions/EWD05xx/EWD566.html. He told us\n\nAnd then from 75 on, computers became cheaper and could be bought by departments and smaller entities. And than came the first interactive computer. Still beasts about two cubics meters, costing two millions belgian francs. But it was low enough to allow people to type in directly commands. I started working here in 75 as a researcher, it have evolved continuasly and i saw computer getting cheaper and getting easier to use.The way to use it was simplified, you could start to go to the beast and try it out.\n\nI remember more or less: you did write down the program in Fortran for instance… We always thought in the beginning that it would work and it didn't, so after a turn around you were giving it back to the operator and you have to wait half a day or a night to get the results.\n\n\n**What kind of program you were working on? ** \n\nI remember the first program i had to work on. You got three numbers, you had to make the program decide if you caxn construct a triangle with the numbers being the sides of the triangle.\n\n\n**That took an afternoon to be processed ?** \n\nWell, yeah. You had to imagine how to do it which was also one problem, than you prepare the card with the punching machine and you give it the package of cards to the operator  who was feeeding the computer with the cards. People hathe taks to fed the computers with paper, cards, than disks and it last onto the magnetic disks period.And after anuber of hours you get a listing, a piece of paper, with the results.\n\n**When where you able to record the program onto the machine?**\n\nI think that happens between 75 and 80. After the punching cards which was a way to record the program we had terminals and typewriters burbyou coylds recordnthe programms. Type writers, terminals, we couldn't record the programms.\n\nWe could store onto the computer, IBM had number for ecerything in remember the 33-30 was a magnetic disk. We didn't touch the machines, operators would change the disks, we could only access the typewriter. That was our most direct connexion to the computer. The mainframes were such huge costly beasts that it had operators day and night keeping it busy. Even at night there were two or three guys mounting tapes, dismounting tapes, that kind of stuff.\n\n**When did you stop working with operators?** \n\nSomewhere between 80 and 90. There were still operators at the main computer of the university, but there were small computer so researchers and student can have direct access when needed.\n\n\n**When did you start to work with software sold by others or gived away in order to do your research?** \n\nYou did need an operating system on the mainframe that was delivered by IBM or \nthe constructor delivering the mainframe. When you bought mini computers, which were the  smaller versions of mainframes in most cases you did buy an operating systems, compilers and all the stuff you need to be able to work with all those things. In most cases because the computer sciences department did buy the mini computer from for instance *digital equipment*  a manufactorer of that time but they didn't buy the software from them. It was not open source or free, but you could get Unix and could run it on those digital equipment computers. That is what the computer department of the University of Louvain la Neuve *l'unité d'informatique* , did.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n%

Programing was writing down the program, than you punched it and the next day you get results, mostly errors, that the way it worked at that time. To teach us programing, they used the langage of that time, fortran and some kind of invented assembly langage, it didn't really exist, it was simplified.\"\n\n\n\"I remember punchcards were a block of papers, we were jealous of the people who came in the computer center with huge stacks of cards. That were really small programs, not complicated one. The fact you had to learn to use the computer from scratch, everything was new, you couldn't rely on previous experiences, everything was new. And to start with small programms was difficult enough. \nThat was also the time when Edsger W. Dijkstra who forked the goto... i still remember him, in an audience, giving us a lecture on modernisation in programming at the International computing symposium 1977 in Liège (programming: from craft to scientific discipline https://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/EWD/transcriptions/EWD05xx/EWD566.html). He told usxx (i'll complete it as soon as possible. i need )\"\n\n\n\"I remember the first program i had to work on. You got three numbers, you had to make the program decide if you caxn construct a triangle with the numbers being the sides of the triangle.\"\n\n\n\n%

To teach us programing, they used the langage of that time, fortran and some kind of invented assembly langage, it didn't really exist, it was simplified.\"\n\n\"I remember punchcards were a block of papers, we were jealous of the people who came in the computer center with huge stacks of cards. That were really small programs, not complicated one. The fact you had to learn to use the computer from scratch, everything was new, you couldn't rely on previous experiences, everything was new. And to start with small programms was difficult enough. \nThat was also the time when Edsger W. Dijkstra who forked the goto... i still remember him, in an audience, giving us a lecture on modernisation in programming at the International computing symposium 1977 in Liège (programming: from craft to scientific discipline https://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/EWD/transcriptions/EWD05xx/EWD566.html). He told usxx (i'll complete it as soon as possible. i need Jean's input)\"\n\n\n\"I remember the first program i had to work on. You got three numbers, you had to make the program decide if you caxn construct a triangle with the numbers being the sides of the triangle.\"\n\n\n\n% http://gallery.constantvzw.org/index.php/Techno-Galactic-Software-Observatory/PWFU3356\n% http://gallery.constantvzw.org/index.php/Techno-Galactic-Software-Observatory/PWFU3343\n% SHOW: tgsoimages.svg kuleuven2\n\n% http://gallery.constantvzw.org/index.php/Techno-Galactic-Software-Observatory/PWFU3350\n% http://gallery.constantvzw.org/index.php/Techno-Galactic-Software-Observatory/PWFU3361\n% SHOW: tgsoimages.svg kuleuven1\n\n\n% RELATESTO:\n% SOURCE:\n\n","attribs":"+2*3*4+6|7+bl+7*6+n|a+8x*0|1+1+26*6|2+2+ay*6|2+2+at*6|1+1+5z*7+3e*4+1*9*4+20*9+1*6|3+3+59*6|1+1|1+1*0|1+1|1+1+2g*0|1+1+2g*0|1+1+w*0|2+2|1+2h+2g*0|1+1|1+x*0|2+2|3+o"},"pool":{"numToAttrib":{"0":["author","a.PRabeGfk5jCXUq8V"],"1":["author",""],"2":["removed","true"],"3":["bold","true"],"4":["underline","true"],"5":["author","a.I4FbrrCTDQNN8GIf"],"6":["author","a.kqv62Q3nhchdwIuK"],"7":["italic","true"],"8":["italic",""],"9":["color","red"]},"nextNum":10},"head":320,"chatHead":-1,"publicStatus":false,"passwordHash":null,"savedRevisions":[{"revNum":320,"savedById":"a.kqv62Q3nhchdwIuK","label":"Revision 320","timestamp":1518017961742,"id":"f422de49a220d7a94449"}]},"globalAuthor:a.PRabeGfk5jCXUq8V":{"colorId":"#0c8ae5","name":"CH","timestamp":1518028734619,"padIDs":"observatory.guide.jean.heuns"},"globalAuthor:":null,"globalAuthor:a.I4FbrrCTDQNN8GIf":{"colorId":"#8af9d7","name":"FS","timestamp":1518027679202,"padIDs":"observatory.guide.jean.heuns"},"globalAuthor:a.kqv62Q3nhchdwIuK":{"colorId":26,"name":null,"timestamp":1518017961742,"padIDs":"observatory.guide.jean.heuns"}}
