% WHAT: Observe and catalog the common gestures, common comportments, and common sense(s) surrounding software.
% HOW: This can be done through observation of yourself or others. Separate the apprehended and matter of fact from the meanings, actions, reactions, judgements, and assessments that the apprehension occasions. Step 1: Begin by assembling a list of questions such as: When you see a software application icon what are you most likely to do? When a software application you are using presents you with a user agreement what are you most likely to do? When a software applciation does something that frustrates you what are you most likely to do? When a software application you are using crashes what are you most likely to do? Step 2: Write down your responses and the responses of any subjects you are observing. Step 3: For each question, think up three other possible responses. Write these down. Step 4: (this step is only for the very curious) Try the other possible responses out the next time you encounter each of the given scenarios.
% WHO:
% URGENCY: 
% NOTE: The common senses and comportments of software are of course informed and conditioned by those of hardware and so perhaps this is more accurately a method for articulating comportments of computing. 

% WARNING: Software wears on both individual and collective bodies and selves. Software may harm your physical and emotional health and that of your society both by design and by accident.
