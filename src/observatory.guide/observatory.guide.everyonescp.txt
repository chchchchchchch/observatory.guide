% METHOD: Persist in calling everyone a Software Curious Person

% REMEMBER:
% WHAT: Naming can be a method for changing a person's relationship to software. For example by (sometimes forcibly) calling everyone a Software Curious Person.
% HOW: Insisting on curiosity as a relation, rather than for example 'fear' or 'admiration' might help cut down the barriers between different types of expertise and allows multiple stakeholders feel entitled to ask questions, to engage, to investigate and to observe.
% WHEN: Persistently
% WHO:
% URGENCY: Software is too important to not be curious about. Observations could benefit from recognising different forms of knowledge. It seems important to engage with software through multiple interests, not only by means of technical expertise.
% NOTE:
% WARNING:

% EXAMPLE: This method was used to address each of the visitors at the Technogalactic Walk-in Clinic.

% TODO: include pdf here linktothepdf can we put the "software curious person intake form" here? --- it is already included near the introduction maybe there is the file there, and here can be the photo of the printed one?
