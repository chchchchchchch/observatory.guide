% METHOD: "Nannyware": Software that observes and addresses the user
% REMEMBER:

% WHAT: - 
    
Nannyware is software meant to protect users while limiting their space of activity. It is software that passive-aggressively suggests or enforces some kind of discipline. In other words, create a form of parental control extended to adults by means of user experience / user interfaces.

Nannyware is a form of Content-control software: software designed to restrict or control the content a reader is authorised to  access, especially when utilised to restrict material delivered over the Internet via the Web, e-mail, or other means. Content-control software determines what content will be available or be blocked.


% HOW: - 

> [...Restrictions] can be applied at various levels: a government
> can attempt to apply them nationwide (see Internet censorship),
> or they can, for example, be applied by an ISP  to its clients,
> by an employer to its personnel, by a school to its  students,
> by a library to its visitors, by a parent to a child's  computer,
> or by an individual user to his or her own computer.
> [@wikipedia:2018:contentcontrolsoftware]

% WHEN:

% WHO: - 

> Unlike filtering, accountability software simply reports on Internet usage.
> No blocking occurs. In setting it up, you decide who will receive 
> the detailed report of the computer’s usage. Web sites that are deemed
> inappropriate, based on the options you’ve chosen, will be red-flagged.
> Because monitoring software is of value only “after the fact”, we do not 
> recommend this as a solution for families with children.
> However, it can be an effective aid in personal accountability for adults.
> There are several available products out there.

% URGENCY: - 

> As with all new lifestyle technologies that come along,
> in the beginning there is also some chaos until their
> impact can be assessed and rules  put in place to bring
> order and respect to their implementation and use  in society.
> When the automobile first came into being there was much 
> confusion regarding who had the right of way, the horse or the car.
> There were no paved roads, speed limits, stop signs, or any other 
> traffic rules. Many lives were lost and much property was destroyed
> as a result. Over time, government and society developed written and 
> unwritten rules as to the proper use of the car.

% WARNING: - 

> Disadvantages of explicit proxy deployment include a user's
> ability to alter an individual client configuration and bypass
> the proxy. To counter this, you can configure the firewall
> to allow client traffic to proceed only through the proxy.
> Note that this type of firewall blocking may result in some

% EXAMPLE: - 

> The main problem here is that the settings that are required
> are different from person to person. For example, I use workrave
> with a 25 second micropause every two and a half minute, and a
> 10 minute restbreak every 20 minutes. I need these frequent breaks,
> because I'm recovering from RSI. And as I recover, I change the
> settings to fewer breaks.  If you have never had any problem at all
> (using the computer, that is), then you may want much fewer breaks,
> say 10 seconds micropause every 10 minutes, and a 5 minute restbreak
> every hour. It is very hard to give proper guidelines here.
> My best advice is to play around and see what works for you.
> Which settings "feel right". Basically, that's how Workrave's defaults
> evolve. [@workrave:2018:faq]
