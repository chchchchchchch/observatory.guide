forensics tools for studying software (or what it is?) <--- This seems too general? Agreed

OTHER NOTES

I think about methods as ways of knowing. One way to handle the publication/documentation tension would be to structure a publication around a set of ways of knowing/methods and then select and shape documentation from the worksession as samples of these methods or taking moments from the workshop as prompts for reflection on these methods. Some of the play would come in from the mix of recognizable and common methods (visit a museum (ie. Namur and Leuven), conduct interviews (ie. with Jean Heuns but also as Relational software observatory consultancy service), organize and hold a worksession (ie. what we did), listen to an expert (ie. sidechannel)) with the less common ones (ie. create a bestiary of software logos, engaging with code through collective reading/performance, etc).

NOTES ON THE GUIDE DURING TGSO

Multiple tasks:
    
    guide for software observation: for participants, for the walk-in clinic, but also a more general public (dissemination)
    guide for the cross session knowledge accumulation: for participants, archiving
    curation/organization is part of both
    a "how to contribute?"
*etherbox as infrastructure
*creation of categories/nomination for topics
*opening/transfer/closure of the guide across the session
*aphorisms for observing software: 
*solidarity in bewilderment
*creating environments where people feel authorized to be in the room
glossary
table of contents

inspiration from the zombie survial guide:
*    software: myths and realities
*how does software come to being and how does it spread (virus)
*how does software survive and/or die
*treatment of the infected
*weapons and combat techniques, places of safety, and how to survive a zombie-infested world
fictional list of documented software encounters throughout history/ daily list of software encounter

Appendix:
    journal of the walk-in clinic
*what models of encounter/observations are there and what works or doesn't work
collection of observation metaphors: from Autopsy to Zone-H (the internet thermomether)
*
a place for whoever is using the guide to also add own experiences
*diagnosis and prescription sheet as a possible record of the encounter at the walk-in clinic
*how could the people who bring in "software" to the walk-in clinic be brought into this
*diagrams, explanations, drawings used at the walk-in clinic can also be recorded here
*provide napkins at the walk-in clinic

COMMENTS...
Indeed the "survivalist" aspect of the guide and the situation of  it's writing could be interesting dimensions to explore. In the past  we've played with the "lego/toy" like aspect of a DIY network  infrastructure in an attempt to emphasize its composability and an  imagination of what custom infrastructures might be. In this case though  perhaps a more explicit survivalist aesthetic could make sense and here  I guess I'm imaging like camping / wilderness survival (a la compasses,  metal food tins, and swiss army knives). In any case, I'm quite  interested in how the infrastrucure of the local server + collaboration  software can take physical form to in some sense "speak for itself" as a  way to somehow both be present but then also remain functional (as any  tool / infrastructure also needs to be). IN this sense, I don't think it  needs to be mentioned per se in the email as it should hopefully just  follow from the idea of writing of the guide -- and this writing will be  "ground based" (as opposed to "cloud based" ;)

Looking forward to the event, until then I will be attempting to get  some kind of automated workflow in place so that the guide can be more  or less "automatically" given form (from say etherpad inputs to PDF  output). The idea though is to do this in a way that remains open to  contribution, in the form of revised and additional flows and outputs.  In any case, I will try to share any mockups along the way.

some visual inspiration?

+cargo cult aesthetics.. roelof wireless totem? ;)

And had to think about bolo bolo, too, some linking elements like the Machine-Travail planétaire (MTP)
https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bolo%27bolo
https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/13/Bolo-glyph_bolo%27bolo_P_M.svg

Yes I was thinking of the camping, compasses aesthetic as well. One thing that I can imagine if it is manageable fundingwise is some kind of wearable USB drive that has the guide in PDF form as a takeaway from the workshop. (Even if the guide is updated/changed after the workshop people could always reload it onto their drive and it would follow the have the essential tools/information on your body at all times motto.)

How to think about image aesthetics such as:
    http://www.infographicsblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/zombie-survival-infographic.jpg
    https://mir-s3-cdn-cf.behance.net/project_modules/disp/78ff3f9590303.560d664d0ff9b.jpg
    
 I think we are proposing already a lot in terms of structuring, focus, topics, approaches.. I would then avoid suggesting aesthetics, especially if they are already ironical takes on formats (in this case the combination of apocalyptic themes with pseudo advisory aesthetics)
