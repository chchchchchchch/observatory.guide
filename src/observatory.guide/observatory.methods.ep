(now under the essentials)\nShe Does Not Feel Lost.\nWhat scale of conversation? Intro could do with some tweaking, but in general works.\nRead through half of the methods. Feels familiar. Need to hand it to interested people that were not at the workshop.\nSend this to people that were at TGSO first.\nLikes the mix: Conversational and some more 'technical'.\n\nSeda also had a look -- some things to add and remove ... introduction (stops with freelancer-utopia, but what about turkers, clickworkers, on-line task workers ...)\nMight need something on services in the clinic description. Some humor!\nIn general: we could be funnier and more surreal! Funny + sharp.

Do we want it to be of use? The difference between documentation and publication is the imagined audience\ndocumentation: audience is the participants, does not have the ambition to be legible to non-participants\npublication: a broader audience (with contributions from other participants but not from those who did not participate in the work session) who would be able to pick it up and understand the techno-galactic condition\n\n\nCan we decide on a few kinds of formats and test them\n- one can be a breakdown like on the methods list\n- one can be more just description/summary/exericse\n\nwe look at the methods\nand other forms of documentation\nsee if the proposed structure works\nspecifically:\n*test: make a round of groupings / hierarchies affinities\n*test: make more methods\n*test: other templates\n*\n7:20 CET back to discuss\n\nPeggy:\n\nFor the interview ... something that could be easily done, short bio interview with 2-3 q to the participants.

What software category does it apply to agile/SaaS?]\n*Who: [who/what gets to observe]\n*Why: [what is the engagement, of the observer with the observed and vice versa]\n*Note: [anything that did not fit above.]\n\n*Method: Testing the testbed: testing software with observatory ambitions (SWOA)\n*By/history/source/origin/process: the \"original testbed\" was proposed by researchers/collaborators in Princeton. Testing this testbed at a local Constant workshop led to the meta-project of testing software meant for testing software. \n*How: The interwebs hosts many projects that aim to produce software for observing software, (from now on Software With Observatory Ambitions (SWOA)). A comparative methodology can be produced by using different SWOA to observe software of interest. Example: use different sniffing software to observe wireless networks. Doing so reveals what is seen as worthy of observation (e.g., what protocols, what space, which devices), the granularity of the observation (e.g., how is the observation captured, in what detail), the logo and conceptual framework of choice etc. \n*Where/when/situation?: Ideally, SWOA can be used everywhere. In reality, institutions, laws and administrators like to control the use of SWOA on infrastructures not also run by the people running it. Hence, we get distinctions like researchers and pen testers (e.g., they were hired) vs. hackers. \n*What: Deep philosophical moment: most software has a recursive observatory ambition (it wants to be observed in its execution, output etc.). Debuggers, logs, dashboards are all instances of software with observatory ambitions and can not be separated from software itself. So, what separates SWOA from software itself? HELP! \n*Who/with: If you can run the SWOA (many of these are promises more than running software/available code), you can do it. The question is: will people like it if you observe their SWOA?\n*Why/urgency/ [this is maybe related to the engagement question?]: If critical engagement in software is a thing, it follows that people would develop software to observe. \n*Note: [anything that did not fit above.]\n*WARNING: \n*REMEMBER: Good SWOA software usually uses an animal as a logo.:D\n*See also: making a bestiary of visual cultures/logos around it\n\n*Method: Rearranging space as conditioning observations (WTC vs. Museum vs. University vs. Startup Office vs. Shifting Walls that became Water Fountains)\n*By: [who developed, tested, proposed this method]\n*How: [ideas for how the observation method can be applied]\n*Where/when: [in what situation, space, circumstances does the observation take place]\n*What: [what/who gets observed.

Editing glossary.\nQuestion: what about this warning:\nhttp://pad.constantvzw.org/p/observatory.guide.warning -- it is a meta-warning that should go first? (now under the essentials)\nShe Does Not Feel Lost.\nWhat scale of conversation? Intro could do with some tweaking, but in general works.\nRead through half of the methods. Feels familiar. Need to hand it to interested people that were not at the workshop.\nSend this to people that were at TGSO first.\nLikes the mix: Conversational and some more 'technical'.\n\nSeda also had a look -- some things to add and remove ... introduction (stops with freelancer-utopia, but what about turkers, clickworkers, on-line task workers ...)\nMight need something on services in the clinic description. Some humor!\nIn general: we could be funnier and more surreal! Funny + sharp. Could use some edge. \"We cannot be funny with software right now\"\nDatabases of populations (El Salvadoreans about to be deported, India's biometric database being sold to journalists etc)\nEmergency ... games of words. Needs some push.\nContinuous integration missing from html?\n\nhttps://pad.constantvzw.org/p/observatory.guide.introduction\nTension in the introduction. First: critical distance, then entanglement. Need to name it/connect it. Helps to tie in the quote?\nLater: \"going beyond\" ... MMo -- need to reformulate. Make quote (why it is there) more xplicit.\nDistance can be critical but not always. \n\n\nWork a bit more on the introduction, this can work on its own\n\n\nPeggy interview\nPeggy has done the interview and will do the transciption by next week\nMeeting was very nice! New stories added. Anecdotes.\n(CH: what about the interview, where/how to put it?)\nLet's just put it into the https://pad.constantvzw.org/p/observatory.guide.jean.heuns pad\ndon't mind the formatting right now.\n\nCluster descriptions not done yet/not in the html.

To keep track of things to be done I added a temporary '% TODO:' \n\nFYI: http://gitlab.constantvzw.org/ch/observatory.guide\n\n\nLAST ROUNDS 2 DECEMBER\n\nPlanning\n\nBefore January 9:\n- Finish descriptions of clusters (Martino? + Femke?) NOT DONE\n- Finish introduction (Done for now? Maybe another round on Feb. 9?) DONE\n- Interview Jean Huens + transcription (Peggy) interview DONE, transcription next week Wed\n- Establish a level of editing that shows a balance between documentation and guidance (all of us try to finish the entries we took on)\n- Finish pdf to a point that no content is missing and we can start discussing design (Christoph) DONE!\n\nMeet January 9, 20h CET (1.5 hr meeting max)\n- See what still needs to be done\n- Send out e-mail to TGSO list: deadline 29 January\n\n[Carlin starts editing]\n\n9 February 12h CET: we meet to finish whatever needs to be done \nCarlin joins at 16h CET\n\nEnd February: print\nMain pads:\nhttp://pad.constantvzw.org/p/observatory.methods\nhttp://pad.constantvzw.org/p/observatory.guide\n\n---\n\nCarlin's questions\n- editing process\n*- different approach for primary materials (taken from workshop) vs framing materials created now\n*- in order to respect the documentation of the primary material (michael)\n*- how can this be a document that oscillates between \"look what cool methods we used and \"here are some things you could try out yourself\"\n\"If you are writing, you have liberties\" - if necessary, ask people who were involved in the thing to \n- order of entries\nhttp://pad.constantvzw.org/p/observatory.guide\n- incorporation of photographs, diagrams, etc\nYES!\n- small note (visit computer collections appears twice in the current html)\n(probably ok now?)\n\nlook for phrases / ways for introducing the chapters/groupings. Could be just a line? A task for someone?\nTest: http://pad.constantvzw.org/p/observatory.guide.grouping.temporality\n\nIntroduction http://pad.constantvzw.org/p/observatory.guide.introduction Peggy + FS + Seda first round\n\nAdd reference to the walk-in clinic?

What software category does it apply to agile/SaaS?]\n*Who: [who/what gets to observe]\n*Why: [what is the engagement, of the observer with the observed and vice versa]\n*Note: [anything that did not fit above.]\n\n*Method: Testing the testbed: testing software with observatory ambitions (SWOA)\n*By/history/source/origin/process: the \"original testbed\" was proposed by researchers/collaborators in Princeton. Testing this testbed at a local Constant workshop led to the meta-project of testing software meant for testing software. \n*How: The interwebs hosts many projects that aim to produce software for observing software, (from now on Software With Observatory Ambitions (SWOA)). A comparative methodology can be produced by using different SWOA to observe software of interest. Example: use different sniffing software to observe wireless networks. Doing so reveals what is seen as worthy of observation (e.g., what protocols, what space, which devices), the granularity of the observation (e.g., how is the observation captured, in what detail), the logo and conceptual framework of choice etc. \n*Where/when/situation?: Ideally, SWOA can be used everywhere. In reality, institutions, laws and administrators like to control the use of SWOA on infrastructures not also run by the people running it. Hence, we get distinctions like researchers and pen testers (e.g., they were hired) vs. hackers. \n*What: Deep philosophical moment: most software has a recursive observatory ambition (it wants to be observed in its execution, output etc.). Debuggers, logs, dashboards are all instances of software with observatory ambitions and can not be separated from software itself. So, what separates SWOA from software itself? HELP! \n*Who/with: If you can run the SWOA (many of these are promises more than running software/available code), you can do it. The question is: will people like it if you observe their SWOA?\n*Why/urgency/ [this is maybe related to the engagement question?]: If critical engagement in software is a thing, it follows that people would develop software to observe. \n*Note: [anything that did not fit above.]\n*WARNING: \n*REMEMBER: Good SWOA software usually uses an animal as a logo.:D\n*See also: making a bestiary of visual cultures/logos around it\n\n*Method: Rearranging space as conditioning observations (WTC vs. Museum vs. University vs. Startup Office vs. Shifting Walls that became Water Fountains)\n*By: [who developed, tested, proposed this method]\n*How: [ideas for how the observation method can be applied]\n*Where/when: [in what situation, space, circumstances does the observation take place]\n*What: [what/who gets observed.

Namur and Leuven), conduct interviews (ie. with Jean Heuns but also as Relational software observatory consultancy service), organize and hold a worksession (ie. what we did), listen to an expert (ie. sidechannel)) with the less common ones (ie. create a bestiary of software logos, engaging with code through collective reading/performance, etc). \n\n\n\n\nChapters/sections\n\n-possible groupings..\n\nFLOWS\nflow-regulation, logistics, seamlessness\ncontinuous integration\nfountains (refreshment)\netherpad->md->pdf->anything pipeline\nflowcharts excercise (Flow of the chart - chart of the flow on demand!)\nembodied flowchart-elevator\n\ntemporality\nflux\ntime-piece \ntempo of agile software/SaaS\n\nresistance\nuseless scroll against productivity\nInterface Détournement\n\nlanguaging\naquine \nglossary-excercise?\nqualifiers (secure, bad, bourgeois, queer..)\n\nhealing\nrelational software observatory consultancy service\nretrospection\nAgile Sun Salutation\nhand reading\nwhen dirty.db gets dirty\n\nclose encounters\nvisiting a museum\ninterviews\nasking the same question\ngetting down in your computer functioning (files/processes/ram)\nrelational software observatory consultancy service\nwith your future?blobservation\n\nembodiment/body techniques\nAgile Sun Salutation: see Healing\nCOLLECTIVE CHAIR YOGA!!!\nfountain \ncomportment of software (occupational hazards)\n\ncollections\nbestiary of software logos (we collect)\ncomputer history museum (institutional collection)\njean heuns collection at leuven (personal/institutional)\nTesting the testbed: testing software with observatory ambitions\n\n\nbeingontheside/inthemiddle/behind\nsomethinginthemiddlemaybe\nelevator\nside channel attacks\n\nMethods for inadequate observation of software [inadequate methods?]\n\nbut then the things in these groupings can be arranged/divided by form?

Editing glossary.\nQuestion: what about this warning:\nhttp://pad.constantvzw.org/p/observatory.guide.warning -- it is a meta-warning that should go first? (now under the essentials)\nShe Does Not Feel Lost.\nWhat scale of conversation? Intro could do with some tweaking, but in general works.\nRead through half of the methods. Feels familiar. Need to hand it to interested people that were not at the workshop.\nSend this to people that were at TGSO first.\nLikes the mix: Conversational and some more 'technical'.\n\nSeda also had a look -- some things to add and remove ... introduction (stops with freelancer-utopia, but what about turkers, clickworkers, on-line task workers ...)\nMight need something on services in the clinic description. Some humor!\nIn general: we could be funnier and more surreal! Funny + sharp. Could use some edge. \"We cannot be funny with software right now\"\nDatabases of populations (El Salvadoreans about to be deported, India's biometric database being sold to journalists etc)\nEmergency ... games of words. Needs some push.\nContinuous integration missing from html?\n\nhttps://pad.constantvzw.org/p/observatory.guide.introduction\nTension in the introduction. First: critical distance, then entanglement. Need to name it/connect it. Helps to tie in the quote?\nLater: \"going beyond\" ... MMo -- need to reformulate. Make quote (why it is there) more xplicit.\nDistance can be critical but not always. \n\n\nWork a bit more on the introduction, this can work on its own?\nSo the text should be a text to be read that stands on its own and does work on its own. \nMaybe the introduction needs to be more explicitly political by\n\nSeda looked for methods \n\nPeggy interview\nPeggy has done the interview and will do the transciption by next week\nMeeting was very nice! New stories added. Anecdotes.\n(CH: what about the interview, where/how to put it?)\nLet's just put it into the https://pad.constantvzw.org/p/observatory.guide.jean.heuns pad\ndon't mind the formatting right now.\n\nCluster descriptions not done yet/not in the html.

Could be just a line? A task for someone?\nTest: http://pad.constantvzw.org/p/observatory.guide.grouping.temporality\n\nIntroduction http://pad.constantvzw.org/p/observatory.guide.introduction Peggy + FS + Seda first round\n\nAdd reference to the walk-in clinic?

Ongoing.\n\nDifference between documentation and publication\n\nExampe: e-mail of jogi. \nThat report is already published and structured?

Do we want it to be of use? The difference between documentation and publication is the imagined audience\ndocumentation: audience is the participants, does not have the ambition to be legible to non-participants\npublication: a broader audience (with contributions from other participants but not from those who did not participate in the work session) who would be able to pick it up and understand the techno-galactic condition\n\n\nCan we decide on a few kinds of formats and test them\n- one can be a breakdown like on the methods list\n- one can be more just description/summary/exericse\n\nwe look at the methods\nand other forms of documentation\nsee if the proposed structure works\nspecifically:\n*test: make a round of groupings / hierarchies affinities\n*test: make more methods\n*test: other templates\n*\n7:20 CET back to discuss\n\nPeggy:\n\nFor the interview ... something that could be easily done, short bio interview with 2-3 q to the participants. Easy to do, and a bit is already done in the introductions. Would be good to have it in the guide for people that have not been involved. Carlin likes this too!\nP. still likes to do long interview with mr. Huens.\nWould like to write down the visit to the museum as an 19th century explorer .\n\nMartino: groupings can certainly work.

What software category does it apply to agile/SaaS?]\n*Who: [who/what gets to observe]\n*Why: [what is the engagement, of the observer with the observed and vice versa]\n*Note: [anything that did not fit above.]\n\n*Method: Testing the testbed: testing software with observatory ambitions (SWOA)\n*By/history/source/origin/process: the \"original testbed\" was proposed by researchers/collaborators in Princeton. Testing this testbed at a local Constant workshop led to the meta-project of testing software meant for testing software. \n*How: The interwebs hosts many projects that aim to produce software for observing software, (from now on Software With Observatory Ambitions (SWOA)). A comparative methodology can be produced by using different SWOA to observe software of interest. Example: use different sniffing software to observe wireless networks. Doing so reveals what is seen as worthy of observation (e.g., what protocols, what space, which devices), the granularity of the observation (e.g., how is the observation captured, in what detail), the logo and conceptual framework of choice etc. \n*Where/when/situation?: Ideally, SWOA can be used everywhere. In reality, institutions, laws and administrators like to control the use of SWOA on infrastructures not also run by the people running it. Hence, we get distinctions like researchers and pen testers (e.g., they were hired) vs. hackers. \n*What: Deep philosophical moment: most software has a recursive observatory ambition (it wants to be observed in its execution, output etc.). Debuggers, logs, dashboards are all instances of software with observatory ambitions and can not be separated from software itself. So, what separates SWOA from software itself? HELP! \n*Who/with: If you can run the SWOA (many of these are promises more than running software/available code), you can do it. The question is: will people like it if you observe their SWOA?\n*Why/urgency/ [this is maybe related to the engagement question?]: If critical engagement in software is a thing, it follows that people would develop software to observe. \n*Note: [anything that did not fit above.]\n*WARNING: \n*REMEMBER: Good SWOA software usually uses an animal as a logo.:D\n*See also: making a bestiary of visual cultures/logos around it\n\n*Method: Rearranging space as conditioning observations (WTC vs. Museum vs. University vs. Startup Office vs. Shifting Walls that became Water Fountains)\n*By: [who developed, tested, proposed this method]\n*How: [ideas for how the observation method can be applied]\n*Where/when: [in what situation, space, circumstances does the observation take place]\n*What: [what/who gets observed.

One way to handle the publication/documentation tension would be to structure a publication around a set of ways of knowing/methods and then select and shape documentation from the worksession as samples of these methods or taking moments from the workshop as prompts for reflection on these methods. Some of the play would come in from the mix of recognizable and common methods (visit a museum (ie. Namur and Leuven), conduct interviews (ie. with Jean Heuns but also as Relational software observatory consultancy service), organize and hold a worksession (ie. what we did), listen to an expert (ie. sidechannel)) with the less common ones (ie. create a bestiary of software logos, engaging with code through collective reading/performance, etc). \n\n\n\n\nChapters/sections\n\n-possible groupings..\n\nFLOWS\nflow-regulation, logistics, seamlessness\ncontinuous integration\nfountains (refreshment)\netherpad->md->pdf->anything pipeline\nflowcharts excercise (Flow of the chart - chart of the flow on demand!)\nembodied flowchart-elevator\n\ntemporality\nflux\ntime-piece \ntempo of agile software/SaaS\n\nresistance\nuseless scroll against productivity\nInterface Détournement\n\nlanguaging\naquine \nglossary-excercise?\nqualifiers (secure, bad, bourgeois, queer..)\n\nhealing\nrelational software observatory consultancy service\nretrospection\nAgile Sun Salutation\nhand reading\nwhen dirty.db gets dirty\n\nclose encounters\nvisiting a museum\ninterviews\nasking the same question\ngetting down in your computer functioning (files/processes/ram)\nrelational software observatory consultancy service\nwith your future?blobservation\n\nembodiment/body techniques\nAgile Sun Salutation: see Healing\nCOLLECTIVE CHAIR YOGA!!!\nfountain \ncomportment of software (occupational hazards)\n\ncollections\nbestiary of software logos (we collect)\ncomputer history museum (institutional collection)\njean heuns collection at leuven (personal/institutional)\nTesting the testbed: testing software with observatory ambitions\n\n\nbeingontheside/inthemiddle/behind\nsomethinginthemiddlemaybe\nelevator\nside channel attacks\n\nMethods for inadequate observation of software [inadequate methods?]\n\nbut then the things in these groupings can be arranged/divided by form? like descrptive entries/ exercises/ diagrams/ conversation with/ gloss/\n\nWARNINGS\n[[warning: \"our methods for observation, like mapping, come with their luggage.\" from Thursday afternoon section of http://observatory.constantvzw.org/etherdump/toc.md.diff.html ]]\n[[warning: some of these methods are not suitable for agile software/SaaS observation]]\n\n\n","attribs":"|1+1g+1e*0|1+1|2+1t*0*1+h*0|5+2j*0+1f*2|1+1*0|3+1j*0*1+7*0|d+pt*2|1+3e*0|5+7s*0+2o*2|3+18*0|2+1s*2|2+4a*0|3+r*0*1+f*0|1+1*2+1y*0|1+1*0+1g*4|1+1*6+1g*0|1+1*4|2+3j*0|1+1*0+1f*7+z*0|4+4*0*1+16*0|b+bl|5+1g+1h*0+9|1+1+1w*0+5|1+1+1a*0+18|2+3t+2p*0+6|du+io5*3|1+1|1+1"}}},"pad:observatory.methods:revs:1201":{"changeset":"Z:lda>1|14=1ls=o*0+1$-","meta":{"author":"a.ocPhP3HyN6Ppfg6m","timestamp":1515526635727}},"pad:observatory.methods:revs:1202":{"changeset":"Z:ldb>2|12=1jz=1r*2+2$ w","meta":{"author":"a.EXnmpSWanmHBGv1u","timestamp":1515526635772}},"pad:observatory.methods:revs:1203":{"changeset":"Z:ldd>6|12=1jz=1t*2+6$ay of ","meta":{"author":"a.EXnmpSWanmHBGv1u","timestamp":1515526636301}},"pad:observatory.methods:revs:1204":{"changeset":"Z:ldj>2|12=1jz=1z*2+2$na","meta":{"author":"a.EXnmpSWanmHBGv1u","timestamp":1515526636921}},"pad:observatory.methods:revs:1205":{"changeset":"Z:ldl>3|14=1m2=p*0+3$- t","meta":{"author":"a.ocPhP3HyN6Ppfg6m","timestamp":1515526637174}},"pad:observatory.methods:revs:1206":{"changeset":"Z:ldo>4|12=1jz=21*2+4$ming","meta":{"author":"a.EXnmpSWanmHBGv1u","timestamp":1515526637451}},"pad:observatory.methods:revs:1207":{"changeset":"Z:lds>1|12=1jz=25*2+1$ ","meta":{"author":"a.EXnmpSWanmHBGv1u","timestamp":1515526637957}},"pad:observatory.methods:revs:1208":{"changeset":"Z:ldt>8|14=1m7=s*0+8$here are","meta":{"author":"a.ocPhP3HyN6Ppfg6m","timestamp":1515526639818}},"pad:observatory.methods:revs:1209":{"changeset":"Z:le1>b|14=1m7=10*0+b$ some missi","meta":{"author":"a.ocPhP3HyN6Ppfg6m","timestamp":1515526641615}},"pad:observatory.methods:revs:121":{"changeset":"Z:jiv>0|g=h3=c-1*0+1$o","meta":{"author":"a.ocPhP3HyN6Ppfg6m","timestamp":1515523224054}},"pad:observatory.methods:revs:1210":{"changeset":"Z:lec>4|14=1m7=1b*0+4$ng.

Editing glossary.\nQuestion: what about this warning:\nhttp://pad.constantvzw.org/p/observatory.guide.warning -- it is a meta-warning that should go first? (now under the essentials)\nShe Does Not Feel Lost.\nWhat scale of conversation? Intro could do with some tweaking, but in general works.\nRead through half of the methods. Feels familiar. Need to hand it to interested people that were not at the workshop.\nSend this to people that were at TGSO first.\nLikes the mix: Conversational and some more 'technical'.\n\nSeda also had a look -- some things to add and remove ... introduction (stops with freelancer-utopia, but what about turkers, clickworkers, on-line task workers ...)\nMight need something on services in the clinic description. Some humor!\nIn general: we could be funnier and more surreal! Funny + sharp. Could use some edge. \"We cannot be funny with software right now\"\nDatabases of populations (El Salvadoreans about to be deported, India's biometric database being sold to journalists etc)\nEmergency ... games of words. Needs some push.\nContinuous integration missing from html?\n\nhttps://pad.constantvzw.org/p/observatory.guide.introduction\nTension in the introduction. First: critical distance, then entanglement. Need to name it/connect it. Helps to tie in the quote?\nLater: \"going beyond\" ... MMo -- need to reformulate. Make quote (why it is there) more xplicit.\nDistance can be critical but not always. \n\n\nWork a bit more on the introduction, this can work on its own?\nSo the text should be a text to be read that stands on its own and does work on its own. \nMaybe the introduction needs to be more explicitly political.\n\nSeda looked for methods -- there are some missing. Christoph will make them appear!\nAlso: if we open to others, they will bring new energy.\nCalendar App Collapsing!\nPeggy: we can do this on the 9th? Or maybe not. \nSeda: \n\nPeggy interview\nPeggy has done the interview and will do the transciption by next week\nMeeting was very nice! New stories added. Anecdotes.\n(CH: what about the interview, where/how to put it?)\nLet's just put it into the https://pad.constantvzw.org/p/observatory.guide.jean.heuns pad\ndon't mind the formatting right now.\n\nCluster descriptions not done yet/not in the html.

The difference between documentation and publication is the imagined audience\ndocumentation: audience is the participants, does not have the ambition to be legible to non-participants\npublication: a broader audience (with contributions from other participants but not from those who did not participate in the work session) who would be able to pick it up and understand the techno-galactic condition\n\n\nCan we decide on a few kinds of formats and test them\n- one can be a breakdown like on the methods list\n- one can be more just description/summary/exericse\n\nwe look at the methods\nand other forms of documentation\nsee if the proposed structure works\nspecifically:\n*test: make a round of groupings / hierarchies affinities\n*test: make more methods\n*test: other templates\n*\n7:20 CET back to discuss\n\nPeggy:\n\nFor the interview ... something that could be easily done, short bio interview with 2-3 q to the participants.

Carlin likes this too!\nP. still likes to do long interview with mr. Huens.\nWould like to write down the visit to the museum as an 19th century explorer .\n\nMartino: groupings can certainly work.

What software category does it apply to agile/SaaS?]\n*Who: [who/what gets to observe]\n*Why: [what is the engagement, of the observer with the observed and vice versa]\n*Note: [anything that did not fit above.]\n\n*Method: Testing the testbed: testing software with observatory ambitions (SWOA)\n*By/history/source/origin/process: the \"original testbed\" was proposed by researchers/collaborators in Princeton. Testing this testbed at a local Constant workshop led to the meta-project of testing software meant for testing software. \n*How: The interwebs hosts many projects that aim to produce software for observing software, (from now on Software With Observatory Ambitions (SWOA)). A comparative methodology can be produced by using different SWOA to observe software of interest. Example: use different sniffing software to observe wireless networks. Doing so reveals what is seen as worthy of observation (e.g., what protocols, what space, which devices), the granularity of the observation (e.g., how is the observation captured, in what detail), the logo and conceptual framework of choice etc. \n*Where/when/situation?: Ideally, SWOA can be used everywhere. In reality, institutions, laws and administrators like to control the use of SWOA on infrastructures not also run by the people running it. Hence, we get distinctions like researchers and pen testers (e.g., they were hired) vs. hackers. \n*What: Deep philosophical moment: most software has a recursive observatory ambition (it wants to be observed in its execution, output etc.). Debuggers, logs, dashboards are all instances of software with observatory ambitions and can not be separated from software itself. So, what separates SWOA from software itself? HELP! \n*Who/with: If you can run the SWOA (many of these are promises more than running software/available code), you can do it. The question is: will people like it if you observe their SWOA?\n*Why/urgency/ [this is maybe related to the engagement question?]: If critical engagement in software is a thing, it follows that people would develop software to observe. \n*Note: [anything that did not fit above.]\n*WARNING: \n*REMEMBER: Good SWOA software usually uses an animal as a logo.:D\n*See also: making a bestiary of visual cultures/logos around it\n\n*Method: Rearranging space as conditioning observations (WTC vs. Museum vs. University vs. Startup Office vs. Shifting Walls that became Water Fountains)\n*By: [who developed, tested, proposed this method]\n*How: [ideas for how the observation method can be applied]\n*Where/when: [in what situation, space, circumstances does the observation take place]\n*What: [what/who gets observed.

One way to handle the publication/documentation tension would be to structure a publication around a set of ways of knowing/methods and then select and shape documentation from the worksession as samples of these methods or taking moments from the workshop as prompts for reflection on these methods. Some of the play would come in from the mix of recognizable and common methods (visit a museum (ie. Namur and Leuven), conduct interviews (ie. with Jean Heuns but also as Relational software observatory consultancy service), organize and hold a worksession (ie. what we did), listen to an expert (ie. sidechannel)) with the less common ones (ie. create a bestiary of software logos, engaging with code through collective reading/performance, etc). \n\n\n\n\nChapters/sections\n\n-possible

Editing glossary.\nQuestion: what about this warning:\nhttp://pad.constantvzw.org/p/observatory.guide.warning -- it is a meta-warning that should go first? (now under the essentials)\nShe Does Not Feel Lost.\nWhat scale of conversation? Intro could do with some tweaking, but in general works.\nRead through half of the methods. Feels familiar. Need to hand it to interested people that were not at the workshop.\nSend this to people that were at TGSO first.\nLikes the mix: Conversational and some more 'technical'.\n\nSeda also had a look -- some things to add and remove ... introduction (stops with freelancer-utopia, but what about turkers, clickworkers, on-line task workers ...)\nMight need something on services in the clinic description. Some humor!\nIn general: we could be funnier and more surreal! Funny + sharp. Could use some edge. \"We cannot be funny with software right now\"\nDatabases of populations (El Salvadoreans about to be deported, India's biometric database being sold to journalists etc)\nEmergency ... games of words. Needs some push.\nContinuous integration missing from html?\n\nhttps://pad.constantvzw.org/p/observatory.guide.introduction\nTension in the introduction. First: critical distance, then entanglement. Need to name it/connect it. Helps to tie in the quote?\nLater: \"going beyond\" ... MMo -- need to reformulate. Make quote (why it is there) more xplicit.\nDistance can be critical but not always. \n\n\nWork a bit more on the introduction, this can work on its own?\nSo the text should be a text to be read that stands on its own and does work on its own. \nMaybe the introduction needs to be more explicitly political.\n\nSeda looked for methods -- there are some missing. Christoph will make them appear!\nAlso: if we open to others, they will bring new energy.\nCalendar App Collapsing!\nPeggy: we can do this on the 9th? Or maybe not. \nSeda: separate time for sharpening the introduction, to keep serioussnes and humor together.\n\nPeggy interview\nPeggy has done the interview and will do the transciption by next week\nMeeting was very nice! New stories added. Anecdotes.\n(CH: what about the interview, where/how to put it?)\nLet's just put it into the https://pad.constantvzw.org/p/observatory.guide.jean.heuns pad\ndon't mind the formatting right now.\nAn hour of conversation. Keeping all of it? An excerpt? Use extracts through the quide.\nDecide on the 9th of February \n\n\nCluster descriptions not done yet/not in the html. Should we write them or use quotes?\n\n\n\nChristoph advanced on processing the pads:\n\nhttp://observatory.constantvzw.org/tgsoguide.html\nhttp://observatory.constantvzw.org/\n-> tgsoguide_1801091008.pdf \n\nTo get an overview regarding the current state of editing the html output works better as the pdf requires more work on the details and layout, which still needs to be done.

What software category does it apply to agile/SaaS?]\n*Who: [who/what gets to observe]\n*Why: [what is the engagement, of the observer with the observed and vice versa]\n*Note: [anything that did not fit above.]\n\n*Method: Testing the testbed: testing software with observatory ambitions (SWOA)\n*By/history/source/origin/process: the \"original testbed\" was proposed by researchers/collaborators in Princeton. Testing this testbed at a local Constant workshop led to the meta-project of testing software meant for testing software. \n*How: The interwebs hosts many projects that aim to produce software for observing software, (from now on Software With Observatory Ambitions (SWOA)). A comparative methodology can be produced by using different SWOA to observe software of interest. Example: use different sniffing software to observe wireless networks. Doing so reveals what is seen as worthy of observation (e.g., what protocols, what space, which devices), the granularity of the observation (e.g., how is the observation captured, in what detail), the logo and conceptual framework of choice etc. \n*Where/when/situation?: Ideally, SWOA can be used everywhere. In reality, institutions, laws and administrators like to control the use of SWOA on infrastructures not also run by the people running it. Hence, we get distinctions like researchers and pen testers (e.g., they were hired) vs. hackers. \n*What: Deep philosophical moment: most software has a recursive observatory ambition (it wants to be observed in its execution, output etc.). Debuggers, logs, dashboards are all instances of software with observatory ambitions and can not be separated from software itself. So, what separates SWOA from software itself? HELP! \n*Who/with: If you can run the SWOA (many of these are promises more than running software/available code), you can do it. The question is: will people like it if you observe their SWOA?\n*Why/urgency/ [this is maybe related to the engagement question?]: If critical engagement in software is a thing, it follows that people would develop software to observe. \n*Note: [anything that did not fit above.]\n*WARNING: \n*REMEMBER: Good SWOA software usually uses an animal as a logo.:D\n*See also: making a bestiary of visual cultures/logos around it\n\n*Method: Rearranging space as conditioning observations (WTC vs. Museum vs. University vs. Startup Office vs. Shifting Walls that became Water Fountains)\n*By: [who developed, tested, proposed this method]\n*How: [ideas for how the observation method can be applied]\n*Where/when: [in what situation, space, circumstances does the observation take place]\n*What: [what/who gets observed.

One way to handle the publication/documentation tension would be to structure a publication around a set of ways of knowing/methods and then select and shape documentation from the worksession as samples of these methods or taking moments from the workshop as prompts for reflection on these methods. Some of the play would come in from the mix of recognizable and common methods (visit a museum (ie. Namur and Leuven), conduct interviews (ie. with Jean Heuns but also as Relational software observatory consultancy service), organize and hold a worksession (ie. what we did), listen to an expert (ie. sidechannel)) with the less common ones (ie. create a bestiary of software logos, engaging with code through collective reading/performance, etc). \n\n\n\n\nChapters/sections\n\n-possible

Editing glossary.\nQuestion: what about this warning:\nhttp://pad.constantvzw.org/p/observatory.guide.warning -- it is a meta-warning that should go first? (now under the essentials)\nShe Does Not Feel Lost.\nWhat scale of conversation? Intro could do with some tweaking, but in general works.\nRead through half of the methods. Feels familiar. Need to hand it to interested people that were not at the workshop.\nSend this to people that were at TGSO first.\nLikes the mix: Conversational and some more 'technical'.\n\nSeda also had a look -- some things to add and remove ... introduction (stops with freelancer-utopia, but what about turkers, clickworkers, on-line task workers ...)\nMight need something on services in the clinic description. Some humor!\nIn general: we could be funnier and more surreal! Funny + sharp. Could use some edge. \"We cannot be funny with software right now\"\nDatabases of populations (El Salvadoreans about to be deported, India's biometric database being sold to journalists etc)\nEmergency ... games of words. Needs some push.\nContinuous integration missing from html?\n\nhttps://pad.constantvzw.org/p/observatory.guide.introduction\nTension in the introduction. First: critical distance, then entanglement. Need to name it/connect it. Helps to tie in the quote?\nLater: \"going beyond\" ... MMo -- need to reformulate. Make quote (why it is there) more xplicit.\nDistance can be critical but not always. \n\n\nWork a bit more on the introduction, this can work on its own?\nSo the text should be a text to be read that stands on its own and does work on its own. \nMaybe the introduction needs to be more explicitly political.\n\nSeda looked for methods -- there are some missing. Christoph will make them appear!\nAlso: if we open to others, they will bring new energy.\nCalendar App Collapsing!\nPeggy: we can do this on the 9th? Or maybe not. \nSeda: separate time for sharpening the introduction, to keep serioussnes and humor together.\n\nPeggy interview\nPeggy has done the interview and will do the transciption by next week\nMeeting was very nice! New stories added. Anecdotes.\n(CH: what about the interview, where/how to put it?)\nLet's just put it into the https://pad.constantvzw.org/p/observatory.guide.jean.heuns pad\ndon't mind the formatting right now.\nAn hour of conversation. Keeping all of it? An excerpt? Use extracts through the quide.\nDecide on the 9th of February 2018 ?\nPeggy will do the transcription anyways. CH + FS think it could work well, different pace.\n\nCluster descriptions not done yet/not in the html. Should we write them or use quotes?\n\nWhat other extra materials could go in an Appendix?\nthe full interview Peggy did\nJogi's email\nWhat else?\nHans: wanted to work on the text -- finished by 9th of\n\nChristoph advanced on processing the pads:\n\nhttp://observatory.constantvzw.org/tgsoguide.html\nhttp://observatory.constantvzw.org/\n-> tgsoguide_1801091008.pdf \n\nTo get an overview regarding the current state of editing the html output works better as the pdf requires more work on the details and layout, which still needs to be done.

YES but WHAT IS SOFTWARE\n\nsing through and to the hardware and software\n\nwhat is the 'entrypoint'(element from inventory?)-method relation\nmethods as a way to label and address things, still keeping open to other materials to enter (ie interview..)\n\nEverything in the guide is a METHOD, but how do we group and groom the methods???\n\nDo we do a publication, an event .. the fact that we have been through an event, and even that we describe it, means we are developing the methods.<- is this like observation transforms the method!?\nSo: is this documentation, or will we open it to new input. Ongoing.\n\nDifference between documentation and publication\n\nExampe: e-mail of jogi. \nThat report is already published and structured?

Do we want it to be of use? The difference between documentation and publication is the imagined audience\ndocumentation: audience is the participants, does not have the ambition to be legible to non-participants\npublication: a broader audience (with contributions from other participants but not from those who did not participate in the work session) who would be able to pick it up and understand the techno-galactic condition\n\n\nCan we decide on a few kinds of formats and test them\n- one can be a breakdown like on the methods list\n- one can be more just description/summary/exericse\n\nwe look at the methods\nand other forms of documentation\nsee if the proposed structure works\nspecifically:\n*test: make a round of groupings / hierarchies affinities\n*test: make more methods\n*test: other templates\n*\n7:20 CET back to discuss\n\nPeggy:\n\nFor the interview ... something that could be easily done, short bio interview with 2-3 q to the participants. Easy to do, and a bit is already done in the introductions. Would be good to have it in the guide for people that have not been involved. Carlin likes this too!\nP. still likes to do long interview with mr. Huens.\nWould like to write down the visit to the museum as an 19th century explorer .\n\nMartino: groupings can certainly work.

What software category does it apply to agile/SaaS?]\n*Who: [who/what gets to observe]\n*Why: [what is the engagement, of the observer with the observed and vice versa]\n*Note: [anything that did not fit above.]\n\n*Method: Testing the testbed: testing software with observatory ambitions (SWOA)\n*By/history/source/origin/process: the \"original testbed\" was proposed by researchers/collaborators in Princeton. Testing this testbed at a local Constant workshop led to the meta-project of testing software meant for testing software. \n*How: The interwebs hosts many projects that aim to produce software for observing software, (from now on Software With Observatory Ambitions (SWOA)). A comparative methodology can be produced by using different SWOA to observe software of interest. Example: use different sniffing software to observe wireless networks. Doing so reveals what is seen as worthy of observation (e.g., what protocols, what space, which devices), the granularity of the observation (e.g., how is the observation captured, in what detail), the logo and conceptual framework of choice etc. \n*Where/when/situation?: Ideally, SWOA can be used everywhere. In reality, institutions, laws and administrators like to control the use of SWOA on infrastructures not also run by the people running it. Hence, we get distinctions like researchers and pen testers (e.g., they were hired) vs. hackers. \n*What: Deep philosophical moment: most software has a recursive observatory ambition (it wants to be observed in its execution, output etc.). Debuggers, logs, dashboards are all instances of software with observatory ambitions and can not be separated from software itself. So, what separates SWOA from software itself? HELP! \n*Who/with: If you can run the SWOA (many of these are promises more than running software/available code), you can do it. The question is: will people like it if you observe their SWOA?\n*Why/urgency/ [this is maybe related to the engagement question?]: If critical engagement in software is a thing, it follows that people would develop software to observe. \n*Note: [anything that did not fit above.]\n*WARNING: \n*REMEMBER: Good SWOA software usually uses an animal as a logo.:D\n*See also: making a bestiary of visual cultures/logos around it\n\n*Method: Rearranging space as conditioning observations (WTC vs. Museum vs. University vs. Startup Office vs. Shifting Walls that became Water Fountains)\n*By: [who developed, tested, proposed this method]\n*How: [ideas for how the observation method can be applied]\n*Where/when: [in what situation, space, circumstances does the observation take place]\n*What: [what/who gets observed.

One way to handle the publication/documentation tension would be to structure a publication around a set of ways of knowing/methods and then select and shape documentation from the worksession as samples of these methods or taking moments from the workshop as prompts for reflection on these methods. Some of the play would come in from the mix of recognizable and common methods (visit a museum (ie. Namur and Leuven), conduct interviews (ie. with Jean Heuns but also as Relational software observatory consultancy service), organize and hold a worksession (ie. what we did), listen to an expert (ie. sidechannel)) with the less common ones (ie. create a bestiary of software logos, engaging with code through collective reading/performance, etc). \n\n\n\n\nChapters/sections\n\n-possible

Editing glossary.\nQuestion: what about this warning:\nhttp://pad.constantvzw.org/p/observatory.guide.warning -- it is a meta-warning that should go first? (now under the essentials)\nShe Does Not Feel Lost.\nWhat scale of conversation? Intro could do with some tweaking, but in general works.\nRead through half of the methods. Feels familiar. Need to hand it to interested people that were not at the workshop.\nSend this to people that were at TGSO first.\nLikes the mix: Conversational and some more 'technical'.\n\nSeda also had a look -- some things to add and remove ... introduction (stops with freelancer-utopia, but what about turkers, clickworkers, on-line task workers ...)\nMight need something on services in the clinic description. Some humor!\nIn general: we could be funnier and more surreal! Funny + sharp. Could use some edge. \"We cannot be funny with software right now\"\nDatabases of populations (El Salvadoreans about to be deported, India's biometric database being sold to journalists etc)\nEmergency ... games of words. Needs some push.\nContinuous integration missing from html?\n\nhttps://pad.constantvzw.org/p/observatory.guide.introduction\nTension in the introduction. First: critical distance, then entanglement. Need to name it/connect it. Helps to tie in the quote?\nLater: \"going beyond\" ... MMo -- need to reformulate. Make quote (why it is there) more xplicit.\nDistance can be critical but not always. \n\n\nWork a bit more on the introduction, this can work on its own?\nSo the text should be a text to be read that stands on its own and does work on its own. \nMaybe the introduction needs to be more explicitly political.\n\nSeda looked for methods -- there are some missing. Christoph will make them appear!\nAlso: if we open to others, they will bring new energy.\nCalendar App Collapsing!\nPeggy: we can do this on the 9th? Or maybe not. \nSeda: separate time for sharpening the introduction, to keep serioussnes and humor together.\n\nCluster descriptions not done yet/not in the html. Should we write them or use quotes?\nSome Humor Can Go Here.\nNeeds writing -- we tried using quotes only, but it does not work for \n\nAppendix\nPeggy has done the interview and will do the transciption by next week\nMeeting was very nice! New stories added. Anecdotes.\n(CH: what about the interview, where/how to put it?)\nLet's just put it into the https://pad.constantvzw.org/p/observatory.guide.jean.heuns pad\ndon't mind the formatting right now.\nAn hour of conversation.

Testing this testbed at a local Constant workshop led to the meta-project of testing software meant for testing software. \n*How: The interwebs hosts many projects that aim to produce software for observing software, (from now on Software With Observatory Ambitions (SWOA)). A comparative methodology can be produced by using different SWOA to observe software of interest. Example: use different sniffing software to observe wireless networks. Doing so reveals what is seen as worthy of observation (e.g., what protocols, what space, which devices), the granularity of the observation (e.g., how is the observation captured, in what detail), the logo and conceptual framework of choice etc. \n*Where/when/situation?: Ideally, SWOA can be used everywhere. In reality, institutions, laws and administrators like to control the use of SWOA on infrastructures not also run by the people running it. Hence, we get distinctions like researchers and pen testers (e.g., they were hired) vs. hackers. \n*What: Deep philosophical moment: most software has a recursive observatory ambition (it wants to be observed in its execution, output etc.). Debuggers, logs, dashboards are all instances of software with observatory ambitions and can not be separated from software itself. So, what separates SWOA from software itself? HELP! \n*Who/with: If you can run the SWOA (many of these are promises more than running software/available code), you can do it. The question is: will people like it if you observe their SWOA?\n*Why/urgency/ [this is maybe related to the engagement question?]: If critical engagement in software is a thing, it follows that people would develop software to observe. \n*Note: [anything that did not fit above.]\n*WARNING: \n*REMEMBER: Good SWOA software usually uses an animal as a logo.:D\n*See also: making a bestiary of visual cultures/logos around it\n\n*Method: Rearranging space as conditioning observations (WTC vs. Museum vs. University vs. Startup Office vs. Shifting Walls that became Water Fountains)\n*By: [who developed, tested, proposed this method]\n*How: [ideas for how the observation method can be applied]\n*Where/when: [in what situation, space, circumstances does the observation take place]\n*What: [what/who gets observed.

One way to handle the publication/documentation tension would be to structure a publication around a set of ways of knowing/methods and then select and shape documentation from the worksession as samples of these methods or taking moments from the workshop as prompts for reflection on these methods. Some of the play would come in from the mix of recognizable and common methods (visit a museum (ie. Namur and Leuven), conduct interviews (ie. with Jean Heuns but also as Relational software observatory consultancy service), organize and hold a worksession (ie. what we did), listen to an expert (ie. sidechannel)) with the less common ones (ie. create a bestiary of software logos, engaging with code through collective reading/performance, etc). \n\n\n\n\nChapters/sections\n\n-possible groupings..\n\n","meta":{"author":"","timestamp":1512742113797}},"pad:observatory.methods:revs:170":{"changeset":"Z:joa>1|8=6r=12-1*0+2$me","meta":{"author":"a.ocPhP3HyN6Ppfg6m","timestamp":1515524935453}},"pad:observatory.methods:revs:1700":{"changeset":"Z:mbi<i|2b=38a-i$","meta":{"author":"a.ocPhP3HyN6Ppfg6m","timestamp":1515527704821,"atext":{"text":"http://pad.constantvzw.org/p/observatory.afterlives\nhttp://pad.constantvzw.org/p/observatory.inventory\nhttp://pad.constantvzw.org/p/observatory.guide --> 1-2 December\n\n9 JANUARY MEETING\n\nAgenda for tonight meeting: \nTHE INTERNATIONAL MEETING\n- See what still needs to be done\n- Send out e-mail to TGSO list: deadline 29 January\n\nMeet here at 20h CET https://meet.jit.si/observatory\n\nEditing\nCarlin has been reading, working on some items. Editing glossary.\nQuestion: what about this warning:\nhttp://pad.constantvzw.org/p/observatory.guide.warning -- it is a meta-warning that should go first? (now under the essentials)\nShe Does Not Feel Lost.\nWhat scale of conversation? Intro could do with some tweaking, but in general works.\nRead through half of the methods. Feels familiar. Need to hand it to interested people that were not at the workshop.\nSend this to people that were at TGSO first.\nLikes the mix: Conversational and some more 'technical'.\n\nSeda also had a look -- some things to add and remove ... introduction (stops with freelancer-utopia, but what about turkers, clickworkers, on-line task workers ...)\nMight need something on services in the clinic description. Some humor!\nIn general: we could be funnier and more surreal! Funny + sharp. Could use some edge. \"We cannot be funny with software right now\"\nDatabases of populations (El Salvadoreans about to be deported, India's biometric database being sold to journalists etc)\nEmergency ... games of words. Needs some push.\nContinuous integration missing from html?\n\nhttps://pad.constantvzw.org/p/observatory.guide.introduction\nTension in the introduction. First: critical distance, then entanglement. Need to name it/connect it. Helps to tie in the quote?\nLater: \"going beyond\" ... MMo -- need to reformulate. Make quote (why it is there) more xplicit.\nDistance can be critical but not always. \n\n\nWork a bit more on the introduction, this can work on its own?\nSo the text should be a text to be read that stands on its own and does work on its own. \nMaybe the introduction needs to be more explicitly political.\n\nSeda looked for methods -- there are some missing. Christoph will make them appear!\nAlso: if we open to others, they will bring new energy.\nCalendar App Collapsing!\nPeggy: we can do this on the 9th? Or maybe not. \nSeda: separate time for sharpening the introduction, to keep serioussnes and humor together.\n\nCluster descriptions not done yet/not in the html. Should we write them or use quotes?\nSome Humor Can Go Here.\nNeeds writing -- we tried using quotes only, but it does not work for all.\n\nhttp://pad.constantvzw.org/p/observatory.guide.grouping.temporality\nhttp://pad.constantvzw.org/p/observatory.guide.grouping.languaging\nillustrations to open the groupings\nWorks well with the design! So, make mixes of images/quotes and some writing.\nCarlin: it does not need to be a lot ... one or two words. Titles already do a lot.\n\nAppendix\nPeggy has done the interview and will do the transciption by next week\nMeeting was very nice! New stories added. Anecdotes.\n(CH: what about the interview, where/how to put it?)\nLet's just put it into the https://pad.constantvzw.org/p/observatory.guide.jean.heuns pad\ndon't mind the formatting right now.\nAn hour of conversation. Keeping all of it? An excerpt? Use extracts through the quide.\nDecide on the 9th of February 2018 ?\nPeggy will do the transcription anyways. CH + FS think it could work well, different pace.\n\nWhat other extra materials could go in an Appendix?\nthe full interview Peggy did\nJogi's email\nWhat else?\nHans text on time: wanted to work on the text -- finished by 9th of February\nAnita: wrote on punchcards, needs to be finished ... a short version would be nice!!\n\nChristoph advanced on processing the pads:\nChristoph is pretty fine\nhttp://observatory.constantvzw.org/tgsoguide.html\nhttp://observatory.constantvzw.org/\n-> tgsoguide_1801091008.pdf\n\nTo get an overview regarding the current state of editing the html output works better as the pdf requires more work on the details and layout, which still needs to be done.

What software category does it apply to agile/SaaS?]\n*Who: [who/what gets to observe]\n*Why: [what is the engagement, of the observer with the observed and vice versa]\n*Note: [anything that did not fit above.]\n\n*Method: Testing the testbed: testing software with observatory ambitions (SWOA)\n*By/history/source/origin/process: the \"original testbed\" was proposed by researchers/collaborators in Princeton. Testing this testbed at a local Constant workshop led to the meta-project of testing software meant for testing software. \n*How: The interwebs hosts many projects that aim to produce software for observing software, (from now on Software With Observatory Ambitions (SWOA)). A comparative methodology can be produced by using different SWOA to observe software of interest. Example: use different sniffing software to observe wireless networks. Doing so reveals what is seen as worthy of observation (e.g., what protocols, what space, which devices), the granularity of the observation (e.g., how is the observation captured, in what detail), the logo and conceptual framework of choice etc. \n*Where/when/situation?: Ideally, SWOA can be used everywhere. In reality, institutions, laws and administrators like to control the use of SWOA on infrastructures not also run by the people running it. Hence, we get distinctions like researchers and pen testers (e.g., they were hired) vs. hackers. \n*What: Deep philosophical moment: most software has a recursive observatory ambition (it wants to be observed in its execution, output etc.). Debuggers, logs, dashboards are all instances of software with observatory ambitions and can not be separated from software itself. So, what separates SWOA from software itself? HELP! \n*Who/with: If you can run the SWOA (many of these are promises more than running software/available code), you can do it. The question is: will people like it if you observe their SWOA?\n*Why/urgency/ [this is maybe related to the engagement question?]: If critical engagement in software is a thing, it follows that people would develop software to observe. \n*Note: [anything that did not fit above.]\n*WARNING: \n*REMEMBER: Good SWOA software usually uses an animal as a logo.:D\n*See also: making a bestiary of visual cultures/logos around it\n\n*Method: Rearranging space as conditioning observations (WTC vs. Museum vs. University vs. Startup Office vs. Shifting Walls that became Water Fountains)\n*By: [who developed, tested, proposed this method]\n*How: [ideas for how the observation method can be applied]\n*Where/when: [in what situation, space, circumstances does the observation take place]\n*What: [what/who gets observed.

One way to handle the publication/documentation tension would be to structure a publication around a set of ways of knowing/methods and then select and shape documentation from the worksession as samples of these methods or taking moments from the workshop as prompts for reflection on these methods. Some of the play would come in from the mix of recognizable and common methods (visit a museum (ie. Namur and Leuven), conduct interviews (ie. with Jean Heuns but also as Relational software observatory consultancy service), organize and hold a worksession (ie. what we did), listen to an expert (ie. sidechannel)) with the less common ones (ie. create a bestiary of software logos, engaging with code through collective reading/performance, etc). \n\n\n\n\nChapters/sections\n\n-possible

20h CET https://meet.jit.si/observatory\n\nEditing\nCarlin has been reading, working on some items. Editing glossary.\nQuestion: what about this warning:\nhttp://pad.constantvzw.org/p/observatory.guide.warning -- it is a meta-warning that should go first? (now under the essentials)\nShe Does Not Feel Lost.\nWhat scale of conversation? Intro could do with some tweaking, but in general works.\nRead through half of the methods. Feels familiar. Need to hand it to interested people that were not at the workshop.\nSend this to people that were at TGSO first.\nLikes the mix: Conversational and some more 'technical'.\n\nSeda also had a look -- some things to add and remove ... introduction (stops with freelancer-utopia, but what about turkers, clickworkers, on-line task workers ...)\nMight need something on services in the clinic description. Some humor!\nIn general: we could be funnier and more surreal! Funny + sharp. Could use some edge. \"We cannot be funny with software right now\"\nDatabases of populations (El Salvadoreans about to be deported, India's biometric database being sold to journalists etc)\nEmergency ... games of words. Needs some push.\nContinuous integration missing from html?\n\nhttps://pad.constantvzw.org/p/observatory.guide.introduction\nTension in the introduction. First: critical distance, then entanglement. Need to name it/connect it. Helps to tie in the quote?\nLater: \"going beyond\" ... MMo -- need to reformulate. Make quote (why it is there) more xplicit.\nDistance can be critical but not always. \n\n\nWork a bit more on the introduction, this can work on its own?\nSo the text should be a text to be read that stands on its own and does work on its own. \nMaybe the introduction needs to be more explicitly political.\n\nSeda looked for methods -- there are some missing. Christoph will make them appear!\nAlso: if we open to others, they will bring new energy.\nCalendar App Collapsing!\nPeggy: we can do this on the 9th? Or maybe not. \nSeda: separate time for sharpening the introduction, to keep serioussnes and humor together.\n\nCluster descriptions not done yet/not in the html. Should we write them or use quotes?\nSome Humor Can Go Here.\nNeeds writing -- we tried using quotes only, but it does not work for all.\n\nhttp://pad.constantvzw.org/p/observatory.guide.grouping.temporality\nhttp://pad.constantvzw.org/p/observatory.guide.grouping.languaging\nillustrations to open the groupings\nWorks well with the design! So, make mixes of images/quotes and some writing.\nCarlin: it does not need to be a lot ... one or two words. Titles already do a lot.\n\nAppendix\nPeggy has done the interview and will do the transciption by next week\nMeeting was very nice! New stories added. Anecdotes.\n(CH: what about the interview, where/how to put it?)\nLet's just put it into the https://pad.constantvzw.org/p/observatory.guide.jean.heuns pad\ndon't mind the formatting right now.\nAn hour of conversation. Keeping all of it? An excerpt? Use extracts through the quide.\nDecide on the 9th of February 2018 ?\nPeggy will do the transcription anyways. CH + FS think it could work well, different pace.\n\nWhat other extra materials could go in an Appendix?\nthe full interview Peggy did\nJogi's email\nWhat else?\nHans text on time: wanted to work on the text -- finished by 9th of February\nAnita: wrote on punchcards, needs to be finished ... a short version would be nice!!\n\nChristoph advanced on processing the pads:\nChristoph is \"pretty fine\"\n\ndifferent parts, different treatments. Now very basic.\n\nhttp://observatory.constantvzw.org/tgsoguide.html\nhttp://observatory.constantvzw.org/\n-> tgsoguide_1801091008.pdf\n\nTo get an overview regarding the current state of editing the html output works better as the pdf requires more work on the details and layout, which still needs to be done. To keep track of things to be done I added a temporary '% TODO:' \n\nFYI: http://gitlab.constantvzw.org/ch/observatory.guide\n\nTech question: intake form ... could we link it, how does it work? How to integrate documents (like pdfs)?\nwrite in your pad ...\n% TODO: include pdf her\nwith description, and CH will look \n\nLAST ROUNDS 2 DECEMBER\n\nPlanning\n\nBefore January 9:\n- Finish descriptions of clusters (Martino? + Femke?) NOT DONE\n- Finish introduction (Done for now? Maybe another round on Feb. 9?) DONE\n- Interview Jean Huens + transcription (Peggy) interview DONE, transcription next week Wed\n- Establish a level of editing that shows a balance between documentation and guidance (all of us try to finish the entries we took on)\n- Finish pdf to a point that no content is missing and we can start discussing design (Christoph) DONE!\n\nMeet January 9, 20h CET (1.5 hr meeting max)\n- See what still needs to be done\n- Send out e-mail to TGSO list: deadline 29 January\n\n[Carlin starts editing]\n\n9 February 12h CET: we meet to finish whatever needs to be done \nCarlin joins at 16h CET\n\nEnd February: print\nMain pads:\nhttp://pad.constantvzw.org/p/observatory.methods\nhttp://pad.constantvzw.org/p/observatory.guide\n\n---\n\nCarlin's questions\n- editing process\n*- different approach for primary materials (taken from workshop) vs framing materials created now\n*- in order to respect the documentation of the primary material (michael)\n*- how can this be a document that oscillates between \"look what cool methods we used and \"here are some things you could try out yourself\"\n\"If you are writing, you have liberties\" - if necessary, ask people who were involved in the thing to \n- order of entries\nhttp://pad.constantvzw.org/p/observatory.guide\n- incorporation of photographs, diagrams, etc\nYES!\n- small note (visit computer collections appears twice in the current html)\n(probably ok now?)\n\nlook for phrases / ways for introducing the chapters/groupings. Could be just a line? A task for someone?\nTest: http://pad.constantvzw.org/p/observatory.guide.grouping.temporality\n\nIntroduction http://pad.constantvzw.org/p/observatory.guide.introduction Peggy + FS + Seda first round\n\nAdd reference to the walk-in clinic? A description. Unlike normal guides: we have not removed the process. WARNING: there will be a mix of abstractions and concrete experiences.\n\nCarlin works on 3 entries\n\nThe interview needs to be done -> Peggy\n\nHans e-mail -> Martino\nAna + Ricardo -> Femke\n\nFor each of the chapter descriptions: quote from the materials/reader? Could be an image. Or a short inspirational phrase? -> Martino tries\nhttp://pad.constantvzw.org/p/observatory.guide\n\nAn email to other TGSO participants, call for help/see if further material is available (once the PDF is more stable)\n\nWARNING: pad fatigue might occur\n\nlatex todo:\n* be able to force empty new lines  (f.ex to put back lines in scrollresistance)\n* differentiate code quotes from pad quotes\n\n\n\n\n\nSAS Survival Handbook: The Ultimate Guide to Surviving Anywhere \nhttps://archive.org/stream/SASSurvivalHandbookTheUltimateGuideToSurvivingAnywhere/AppNee.com.SAS.Survival.Handbook.2nd.Edition#page/n359/mode/2up\nThe  Rudiments Of Wisdom encyclopaedia by Tim Hunkin.\nhttp://www.rudimentsofwisdom.com\n\nissue: different materials. works well to situate the week. fr an interview, a good way to introduce. but with folders, code ... so brought the SAS guide.

The difference between documentation and publication is the imagined audience\ndocumentation: audience is the participants, does not have the ambition to be legible to non-participants\npublication: a broader audience (with contributions from other participants but not from those who did not participate in the work session) who would be able to pick it up and understand the techno-galactic condition\n\n\nCan we decide on a few kinds of formats and test them\n- one can be a breakdown like on the methods list\n- one can be more just description/summary/exericse\n\nwe look at the methods\nand other forms of documentation\nsee if the proposed structure works\nspecifically:\n*test: make a round of groupings / hierarchies affinities\n*test: make more methods\n*test: other templates\n*\n7:20 CET back to discuss\n\nPeggy:\n\nFor the interview ... something that could be easily done, short bio interview with 2-3 q to the participants. Easy to do, and a bit is already done in the introductions. Would be good to have it in the guide for people that have not been involved. Carlin likes this too!\nP. still likes to do long interview with mr. Huens.\nWould like to write down the visit to the museum as an 19th century explorer .\n\nMartino: groupings can certainly work.

If the object is produced by the mode of observation. or what if the mode of observation is produced by the object ...\nAre we producing a guide that we want to exist or producing a document of what happened (a bit of both?)\nName the things that we might otherwise take for granted.\nHow do we name what's different about software and observation across time, without rendering the new or the old into an ideal?\nA quite litteral, chronological list: based on the week, based on the observations of/that were experimented with the week\n*we follow the methods of observation day by day, session by session and list them. \n*follow the program, but all the different things that started to happen.\n*Trying to stay chronological so we force ourselves to consider the different experiments/methods that happened.\n\n[[warning: \"our methods for observation, like mapping, come with their luggage.\" from Thursday afternoon section of http://observatory.constantvzw.org/etherdump/toc.md.diff.html ]]\n[[warning: some of these methods are not suitable for agile software/SaaS observation]]\n\nTEMPLATE FOR DESCRIBING PROPOSED METHODS:\n*By: [who developed, tested, proposed this method]\n*How: [ideas for how the observation method can be applied]\n*Where/when: [in what situation, space, circumstances does the observation take place]\n*What: [what/who gets observed.

What software category does it apply to agile/SaaS?]\n*Who: [who/what gets to observe]\n*Why: [what is the engagement, of the observer with the observed and vice versa]\n*Note: [anything that did not fit above.]\n\n*Method: Testing the testbed: testing software with observatory ambitions (SWOA)\n*By/history/source/origin/process: the \"original testbed\" was proposed by researchers/collaborators in Princeton. Testing this testbed at a local Constant workshop led to the meta-project of testing software meant for testing software. \n*How: The interwebs hosts many projects that aim to produce software for observing software, (from now on Software With Observatory Ambitions (SWOA)). A comparative methodology can be produced by using different SWOA to observe software of interest. Example: use different sniffing software to observe wireless networks. Doing so reveals what is seen as worthy of observation (e.g., what protocols, what space, which devices), the granularity of the observation (e.g., how is the observation captured, in what detail), the logo and conceptual framework of choice etc. \n*Where/when/situation?: Ideally, SWOA can be used everywhere. In reality, institutions, laws and administrators like to control the use of SWOA on infrastructures not also run by the people running it. Hence, we get distinctions like researchers and pen testers (e.g., they were hired) vs. hackers. \n*What: Deep philosophical moment: most software has a recursive observatory ambition (it wants to be observed in its execution, output etc.). Debuggers, logs, dashboards are all instances of software with observatory ambitions and can not be separated from software itself. So, what separates SWOA from software itself? HELP! \n*Who/with: If you can run the SWOA (many of these are promises more than running software/available code), you can do it.

One way to handle the publication/documentation tension would be to structure a publication around a set of ways of knowing/methods and then select and shape documentation from the worksession as samples of these methods or taking moments from the workshop as prompts for reflection on these methods. Some of the play would come in from the mix of recognizable and common methods (visit a museum (ie. Namur and Leuven), conduct interviews (ie. with Jean Heuns but also as Relational software observatory consultancy service), organize and hold a worksession (ie. what we did), listen to an expert (ie. sidechannel)) with the less common ones (ie. create a bestiary of software logos, engaging with code through collective reading/performance, etc). \n\n\n\n\nChapters/sections\n\n-possible

--> 1-2 December\n\n9 JANUARY MEETING\n\nAgenda for tonight meeting: \nTHE INTERNATIONAL MEETING\n- See what still needs to be done\n- Send out e-mail to TGSO list: deadline 29 January\n\nMeet here at 20h CET https://meet.jit.si/observatory\n\nEditing\nCarlin has been reading, working on some items. Editing glossary.\nQuestion: what about this warning:\nhttp://pad.constantvzw.org/p/observatory.guide.warning -- it is a meta-warning that should go first? (now under the essentials)\nShe Does Not Feel Lost.\nWhat scale of conversation? Intro could do with some tweaking, but in general works.\nRead through half of the methods. Feels familiar. Need to hand it to interested people that were not at the workshop.\nSend this to people that were at TGSO first.\nLikes the mix: Conversational and some more 'technical'.\n\nSeda also had a look -- some things to add and remove ... introduction (stops with freelancer-utopia, but what about turkers, clickworkers, on-line task workers ...)\nMight need something on services in the clinic description. Some humor!\nIn general: we could be funnier and more surreal! Funny + sharp. Could use some edge. \"We cannot be funny with software right now\"\nDatabases of populations (El Salvadoreans about to be deported, India's biometric database being sold to journalists etc)\nEmergency ... games of words. Needs some push.\nContinuous integration missing from html?\n\nhttps://pad.constantvzw.org/p/observatory.guide.introduction\nTension in the introduction. First: critical distance, then entanglement. Need to name it/connect it. Helps to tie in the quote?\nLater: \"going beyond\" ... MMo -- need to reformulate. Make quote (why it is there) more xplicit.\nDistance can be critical but not always. \n\n\nWork a bit more on the introduction, this can work on its own?\nSo the text should be a text to be read that stands on its own and does work on its own. \nMaybe the introduction needs to be more explicitly political.\n\nSeda looked for methods -- there are some missing. Christoph will make them appear!\nAlso: if we open to others, they will bring new energy.\nCalendar App Collapsing!\nPeggy: we can do this on the 9th? Or maybe not. \nSeda: separate time for sharpening the introduction, to keep serioussnes and humor together.\n\nCluster descriptions not done yet/not in the html. Should we write them or use quotes?\nSome Humor Can Go Here.\nNeeds writing -- we tried using quotes only, but it does not work for all.\n\nhttp://pad.constantvzw.org/p/observatory.guide.grouping.temporality\nhttp://pad.constantvzw.org/p/observatory.guide.grouping.languaging\nillustrations to open the groupings\nWorks well with the design! So, make mixes of images/quotes and some writing.\nCarlin: it does not need to be a lot ... one or two words. Titles already do a lot.\n\nAppendix\nPeggy has done the interview and will do the transciption by next week\nMeeting was very nice! New stories added. Anecdotes.\n(CH: what about the interview, where/how to put it?)\nLet's just put it into the https://pad.constantvzw.org/p/observatory.guide.jean.heuns pad\ndon't mind the formatting right now.\nAn hour of conversation. Keeping all of it? An excerpt? Use extracts through the quide.\nDecide on the 9th of February 2018 ?\nPeggy will do the transcription anyways. CH + FS think it could work well, different pace.\n\nWhat other extra materials could go in an Appendix?\nthe full interview Peggy did\nJogi's email\nWhat else?\nHans text on time: wanted to work on the text -- finished by 9th of February\nAnita: wrote on punchcards, needs to be finished ... a short version would be nice!!\n\nChristoph advanced on processing the pads:\nChristoph is \"pretty fine\"\n\ndifferent parts, different treatments. Now very basic.\n\nhttp://observatory.constantvzw.org/tgsoguide.html\nhttp://observatory.constantvzw.org/\n-> tgsoguide_1801091008.pdf\n\nTo get an overview regarding the current state of editing the html output works better as the pdf requires more work on the details and layout, which still needs to be done. To keep track of things to be done I added a temporary '% TODO:' \n\nFYI: http://gitlab.constantvzw.org/ch/observatory.guide\n\nTech question: intake form ... could we link it, how does it work? How to integrate documents (like pdfs)?\nwrite in your pad ...\n% TODO: include pdf here linktothepdf\nand CH will look :-)\n\nIncluding other TGSO people: an email!\n- specific questions\n- general call\n- make little howto (\n\nDear all,\n\nIt has b\nyou are invited to \nhow to\n\n\n\n\n\nLAST ROUNDS 2 DECEMBER\n\nPlanning\n\nBefore January 9:\n- Finish descriptions of clusters (Martino? + Femke?) NOT DONE\n- Finish introduction (Done for now? Maybe another round on Feb. 9?) DONE\n- Interview Jean Huens + transcription (Peggy) interview DONE, transcription next week Wed\n- Establish a level of editing that shows a balance between documentation and guidance (all of us try to finish the entries we took on)\n- Finish pdf to a point that no content is missing and we can start discussing design (Christoph) DONE!\n\nMeet January 9, 20h CET (1.5 hr meeting max)\n- See what still needs to be done\n- Send out e-mail to TGSO list: deadline 29 January\n\n[Carlin starts editing]\n\n9 February 12h CET: we meet to finish whatever needs to be done \nCarlin joins at 16h CET\n\nEnd February: print\nMain pads:\nhttp://pad.constantvzw.org/p/observatory.methods\nhttp://pad.constantvzw.org/p/observatory.guide\n\n---\n\nCarlin's questions\n- editing process\n*- different approach for primary materials (taken from workshop) vs framing materials created now\n*- in order to respect the documentation of the primary material (michael)\n*- how can this be a document that oscillates between \"look what cool methods we used and \"here are some things you could try out yourself\"\n\"If you are writing, you have liberties\" - if necessary, ask people who were involved in the thing to \n- order of entries\nhttp://pad.constantvzw.org/p/observatory.guide\n- incorporation of photographs, diagrams, etc\nYES!\n- small note (visit computer collections appears twice in the current html)\n(probably ok now?)\n\nlook for phrases / ways for introducing the chapters/groupings. Could be just a line? A task for someone?\nTest: http://pad.constantvzw.org/p/observatory.guide.grouping.temporality\n\nIntroduction http://pad.constantvzw.org/p/observatory.guide.introduction Peggy + FS + Seda first round\n\nAdd reference to the walk-in clinic? A description. Unlike normal guides: we have not removed the process. WARNING: there will be a mix of abstractions and concrete experiences.\n\nCarlin works on 3 entries\n\nThe interview needs to be done -> Peggy\n\nHans e-mail -> Martino\nAna + Ricardo -> Femke\n\nFor each of the chapter descriptions: quote from the materials/reader? Could be an image. Or a short inspirational phrase? -> Martino tries\nhttp://pad.constantvzw.org/p/observatory.guide\n\nAn email to other TGSO participants, call for help/see if further material is available (once the PDF is more stable)\n\nWARNING: pad fatigue might occur\n\nlatex todo:\n* be able to force empty new lines  (f.ex to put back lines in scrollresistance)\n* differentiate code quotes from pad quotes\n\n\n\n\n\nSAS Survival Handbook: The Ultimate Guide to Surviving Anywhere \nhttps://archive.org/stream/SASSurvivalHandbookTheUltimateGuideToSurvivingAnywhere/AppNee.com.SAS.Survival.Handbook.2nd.Edition#page/n359/mode/2up\nThe  Rudiments Of Wisdom encyclopaedia by Tim Hunkin.\nhttp://www.rudimentsofwisdom.com\n\nissue: different materials. works well to situate the week. fr an interview, a good way to introduce. but with folders, code ... so brought the SAS guide. What is good about that it is very loose ... different layers, zooms ... \nflowing things from one into the other .. not too formulaic. find ways to jump different tones.\nmultiplicity of tones. so ... something in-between the two\n\ntemplate as a way to make the connection back to the original questions ... what are the things to pay attention to, to give space to it.\n\nwe did not do any grouping, but maybe that could be interesting to try?\n\nwe were testing observatory method, the chronological order to prevent us from paying too much attention to the clinic and would also look at the exercises and thinking from the first days. \n\ncould each method then propose its form/content?\n\neven to have chapters that have no entry or only an introduction and no methods, to play the templating without feeling that we have to fulfil that template \n\nhttp://observatory.constantvzw.org/documents/mia/mia6.gif\n\nnoise is back,\n\ntest: make a round of groupings / hierarchies affinities\ntest: make more methods\ntest: other templates\n\nseda wondering about us defining different types of participants: stationary (that's us), migratory (but some stayed), walk-in (visitors to the clinic), sedentary ... was that a method?\ndo all the methods need to be related to software? YES but WHAT IS SOFTWARE\n\nsing through and to the hardware and software\n\nwhat is the 'entrypoint'(element from inventory?)-method relation\nmethods as a way to label and address things, still keeping open to other materials to enter (ie interview..)\n\nEverything in the guide is a METHOD, but how do we group and groom the methods???\n\nDo we do a publication, an event .. the fact that we have been through an event, and even that we describe it, means we are developing the methods.<- is this like observation transforms the method!?\nSo: is this documentation, or will we open it to new input. Ongoing.\n\nDifference between documentation and publication\n\nExampe: e-mail of jogi. \nThat report is already published and structured? It is an easier ongoingness -- to accept other contrib\n\nongoingness? thinking it structured around the week, and its participants. if you have not been involved, it is difficult to understand?\n\nWho is it for? Do we want it to be of use? The difference between documentation and publication is the imagined audience\ndocumentation: audience is the participants, does not have the ambition to be legible to non-participants\npublication: a broader audience (with contributions from other participants but not from those who did not participate in the work session) who would be able to pick it up and understand the techno-galactic condition\n\n\nCan we decide on a few kinds of formats and test them\n- one can be a breakdown like on the methods list\n- one can be more just description/summary/exericse\n\nwe look at the methods\nand other forms of documentation\nsee if the proposed structure works\nspecifically:\n*test: make a round of groupings / hierarchies affinities\n*test: make more methods\n*test: other templates\n*\n7:20 CET back to discuss\n\nPeggy:\n\nFor the interview ... something that could be easily done, short bio interview with 2-3 q to the participants. Easy to do, and a bit is already done in the introductions. Would be good to have it in the guide for people that have not been involved. Carlin likes this too!\nP. still likes to do long interview with mr. Huens.\nWould like to write down the visit to the museum as an 19th century explorer .\n\nMartino: groupings can certainly work.

Testing this testbed at a local Constant workshop led to the meta-project of testing software meant for testing software. \n*How: The interwebs hosts many projects that aim to produce software for observing software, (from now on Software With Observatory Ambitions (SWOA)). A comparative methodology can be produced by using different SWOA to observe software of interest. Example: use different sniffing software to observe wireless networks. Doing so reveals what is seen as worthy of observation (e.g., what protocols, what space, which devices), the granularity of the observation (e.g., how is the observation captured, in what detail), the logo and conceptual framework of choice etc. \n*Where/when/situation?: Ideally, SWOA can be used everywhere. In reality, institutions, laws and administrators like to control the use of SWOA on infrastructures not also run by the people running it. Hence, we get distinctions like researchers and pen testers (e.g., they were hired) vs. hackers. \n*What: Deep philosophical moment: most software has a recursive observatory ambition (it wants to be observed in its execution, output etc.). Debuggers, logs, dashboards are all instances of software with observatory ambitions and can not be separated from software itself. So, what separates SWOA from software itself? HELP! \n*Who/with: If you can run the SWOA (many of these are promises more than running software/available code), you can do it. The question is: will people like it if you observe their SWOA?\n*Why/urgency/ [this is maybe related to the engagement question?]: If critical engagement in software is a thing, it follows that people would develop software to observe. \n*Note: [anything that did not fit above.]\n*WARNING: \n*REMEMBER: Good SWOA software usually uses an animal as a logo.:D\n*See also: making a bestiary of visual cultures/logos around it\n\n*Method: Rearranging space as conditioning observations (WTC vs. Museum vs. University vs. Startup Office vs. Shifting Walls that became Water Fountains)\n*By: [who developed, tested, proposed this method]\n*How: [ideas for how the observation method can be applied]\n*Where/when: [in what situation, space, circumstances does the observation take place]\n*What: [what/who gets observed.

Some of the play would come in from the mix of recognizable and common methods (visit a museum (ie. Namur and Leuven), conduct interviews (ie. with Jean Heuns but also as Relational software observatory consultancy service), organize and hold a worksession (ie. what we did), listen to an expert (ie.

What is good about that it is very loose ... different layers, zooms ... \nflowing things from one into the other .. not too formulaic. find ways to jump different tones.\nmultiplicity of tones. so ... something in-between the two\n\ntemplate as a way to make the connection back to the original questions ... what are the things to pay attention to, to give space to it.\n\nwe did not do any grouping, but maybe that could be interesting to try?\n\nwe were testing observatory method, the chronological order to prevent us from paying too much attention to the clinic and would also look at the exercises and thinking from the first days. \n\ncould each method then propose its form/content?\n\neven to have chapters that have no entry or only an introduction and no methods, to play the templating without feeling that we have to fulfil that template \n\nhttp://observatory.constantvzw.org/documents/mia/mia6.gif\n\nnoise is back,\n\ntest: make a round of groupings / hierarchies affinities\ntest: make more methods\ntest: other templates\n\nseda wondering about us defining different types of participants: stationary (that's us), migratory (but some stayed), walk-in (visitors to the clinic), sedentary ... was that a method?\ndo all the methods need to be related to software? YES but WHAT IS SOFTWARE\n\nsing through and to the hardware and software\n\nwhat is the 'entrypoint'(element from inventory?)-method relation\nmethods as a way to label and address things, still keeping open to other materials to enter (ie interview..)\n\nEverything in the guide is a METHOD, but how do we group and groom the methods???\n\nDo we do a publication, an event .. the fact that we have been through an event, and even that we describe it, means we are developing the methods.<- is this like observation transforms the method!?\nSo: is this documentation, or will we open it to new input. Ongoing.\n\nDifference between documentation and publication\n\nExampe: e-mail of jogi. \nThat report is already published and structured? It is an easier ongoingness -- to accept other contrib\n\nongoingness? thinking it structured around the week, and its participants. if you have not been involved, it is difficult to understand?\n\nWho is it for? Do we want it to be of use? The difference between documentation and publication is the imagined audience\ndocumentation: audience is the participants, does not have the ambition to be legible to non-participants\npublication: a broader audience (with contributions from other participants but not from those who did not participate in the work session) who would be able to pick it up and understand the techno-galactic condition\n\n\nCan we decide on a few kinds of formats and test them\n- one can be a breakdown like on the methods list\n- one can be more just description/summary/exericse\n\nwe look at the methods\nand other forms of documentation\nsee if the proposed structure works\nspecifically:\n*test: make a round of groupings / hierarchies affinities\n*test: make more methods\n*test: other templates\n*\n7:20 CET back to discuss\n\nPeggy:\n\nFor the interview ... something that could be easily done, short bio interview with 2-3 q to the participants. Easy to do, and a bit is already done in the introductions. Would be good to have it in the guide for people that have not been involved. Carlin likes this too!\nP. still likes to do long interview with mr. Huens.\nWould like to write down the visit to the museum as an 19th century explorer .\n\nMartino: groupings can certainly work.

Testing this testbed at a local Constant workshop led to the meta-project of testing software meant for testing software. \n*How: The interwebs hosts many projects that aim to produce software for observing software, (from now on Software With Observatory Ambitions (SWOA)). A comparative methodology can be produced by using different SWOA to observe software of interest. Example: use different sniffing software to observe wireless networks. Doing so reveals what is seen as worthy of observation (e.g., what protocols, what space, which devices), the granularity of the observation (e.g., how is the observation captured, in what detail), the logo and conceptual framework of choice etc. \n*Where/when/situation?: Ideally, SWOA can be used everywhere. In reality, institutions, laws and administrators like to control the use of SWOA on infrastructures not also run by the people running it. Hence, we get distinctions like researchers and pen testers (e.g., they were hired) vs. hackers. \n*What: Deep philosophical moment: most software has a recursive observatory ambition (it wants to be observed in its execution, output etc.). Debuggers, logs, dashboards are all instances of software with observatory ambitions and can not be separated from software itself. So, what separates SWOA from software itself? HELP! \n*Who/with: If you can run the SWOA (many of these are promises more than running software/available code), you can do it. The question is: will people like it if you observe their SWOA?\n*Why/urgency/ [this is maybe related to the engagement question?]: If critical engagement in software is a thing, it follows that people would develop software to observe. \n*Note: [anything that did not fit above.]\n*WARNING: \n*REMEMBER: Good SWOA software usually uses an animal as a logo.:D\n*See also: making a bestiary of visual cultures/logos around it\n\n*Method: Rearranging space as conditioning observations (WTC vs. Museum vs. University vs. Startup Office vs. Shifting Walls that became Water Fountains)\n*By: [who developed, tested, proposed this method]\n*How: [ideas for how the observation method can be applied]\n*Where/when: [in what situation, space, circumstances does the observation take place]\n*What: [what/who gets observed.

One way to handle the publication/documentation tension would be to structure a publication around a set of ways of knowing/methods and then select and shape documentation from the worksession as samples of these methods or taking moments from the workshop as prompts for reflection on these methods. Some of the play would come in from the mix of recognizable and common methods (visit a museum (ie. Namur and Leuven), conduct interviews (ie. with Jean Heuns but also as Relational software observatory consultancy service), organize and hold a worksession (ie. what we did), listen to an expert (ie. sidechannel)) with the less common ones (ie. create a bestiary of software logos, engaging with code through collective reading/performance, etc). \n\n\n\n\nChapters/sections\n\n-possible groupings..\n\nFLOWS\nflow-regulation, logistics, seamlessness\ncontinuous integration\nfountains (refreshment)\netherpad->md->pdf->anything pipeline\nflowcharts excercise (Flow of the chart - chart of the flow on demand!)\nembodied flowchart-elevator\n\ntemporality\nflux\ntime-piece \ntempo of agile software/SaaS\n\nresistance\nuseless scroll against productivity\nInterface Détournement\n\nlanguaging\naquine \nglossary-excercise?\nqualifiers (secure, bad, bourgeois, queer..)\n\nhealing\nrelational software observatory consultancy service\nretrospection\nAgile Sun Salutation\nhand reading\nwhen dirty.db gets dirty\n\nclose encounters\nvisiting a museum\ninterviews\nasking the same question\ngetting down in your computer functioning (files/processes/ram)\nrelational software observatory consultancy service\nwith your future?blobservation\n\nembodiment/body techniques\nAgile Sun Salutation: see Healing\nCOLLECTIVE CHAIR YOGA!!!\nfountain \ncomportment of software (occupational hazards)\n\ncollections\nbestiary of software logos (we collect)\ncomputer history museum (institutional collection)\njean heuns collection at leuven (personal/institutional)\nTesting the testbed: testing software with observatory ambitions\n\n\nbeingontheside/inthemiddle/behind\nsomethinginthemiddlemaybe\nelevator\nside channel attacks\n\nMethods for inadequate observation of software [inadequate methods?]\n\nbut then the things in these groupings can be arranged/divided by form? like descrptive entries/ exercises/ diagrams/ conversation with/ gloss/\n\nWARNINGS\n[[warning: \"our methods for observation, like mapping, come with their luggage.\" from Thursday afternoon section of http://observatory.constantvzw.org/etherdump/toc.md.diff.html ]]\n[[warning: some of these methods are not suitable for agile software/SaaS observation]]\n\n","attribs":"|4+4q*0*1+h*0|l+j4|5+1g+1h*0+9|1+1+1w*0+5|3+54+2p*0+6|dv+io6"}}},"pad:observatory.methods:revs:2000":{"changeset":"Z:mq1<2|2s=3ll=1f-2$","meta":{"author":"a.CLJqMQchPGX2f376","timestamp":1515528121182,"atext":{"text":"http://pad.constantvzw.org/p/observatory.afterlives\nhttp://pad.constantvzw.org/p/observatory.inventory\nhttp://pad.constantvzw.org/p/observatory.guide --> 1-2 December\n\n9 JANUARY MEETING\n\nAgenda for tonight meeting: \nTHE INTERNATIONAL MEETING\n- See what still needs to be done\n- Send out e-mail to TGSO list: deadline 29 January\n\nMeet here at 20h CET https://meet.jit.si/observatory\n\nEditing\nCarlin has been reading, working on some items.

Testing this testbed at a local Constant workshop led to the meta-project of testing software meant for testing software. \n*How: The interwebs hosts many projects that aim to produce software for observing software, (from now on Software With Observatory Ambitions (SWOA)). A comparative methodology can be produced by using different SWOA to observe software of interest. Example: use different sniffing software to observe wireless networks. Doing so reveals what is seen as worthy of observation (e.g., what protocols, what space, which devices), the granularity of the observation (e.g., how is the observation captured, in what detail), the logo and conceptual framework of choice etc. \n*Where/when/situation?: Ideally, SWOA can be used everywhere. In reality, institutions, laws and administrators like to control the use of SWOA on infrastructures not also run by the people running it. Hence, we get distinctions like researchers and pen testers (e.g., they were hired) vs. hackers. \n*What: Deep philosophical moment: most software has a recursive observatory ambition (it wants to be observed in its execution, output etc.). Debuggers, logs, dashboards are all instances of software with observatory ambitions and can not be separated from software itself. So, what separates SWOA from software itself? HELP! \n*Who/with: If you can run the SWOA (many of these are promises more than running software/available code), you can do it. The question is: will people like it if you observe their SWOA?\n*Why/urgency/ [this is maybe related to the engagement question?]: If critical engagement in software is a thing, it follows that people would develop software to observe. \n*Note: [anything that did not fit above.]\n*WARNING: \n*REMEMBER: Good SWOA software usually uses an animal as a logo.:D\n*See also: making a bestiary of visual cultures/logos around it\n\n*Method: Rearranging space as conditioning observations (WTC vs. Museum vs. University vs. Startup Office vs. Shifting Walls that became Water Fountains)\n*By: [who developed, tested, proposed this method]\n*How: [ideas for how the observation method can be applied]\n*Where/when: [in what situation, space, circumstances does the observation take place]\n*What: [what/who gets observed.

Some of the play would come in from the mix of recognizable and common methods (visit a museum (ie. Namur and Leuven), conduct interviews (ie. with Jean Heuns but also as Relational software observatory consultancy service), organize and hold a worksession (ie. what we did), listen to an expert (ie. sidechannel)) with the less common ones (ie. create a bestiary of software logos, engaging with code through collective reading/performance, etc). \n\n\n\n\nChapters/sections\n\n-possible groupings..\n\nFLOWS\nflow-regulation, logistics, seamlessness\ncontinuous integration\nfountains (refreshment)\netherpad->md->pdf->anything pipeline\nflowcharts excercise (Flow of the chart - chart of the flow on demand!)\nembodied flowchart-elevator\n\ntemporality\nflux\ntime-piece \ntempo of agile software/SaaS\n\nresistance\nuseless scroll against productivity\nInterface Détournement\n\nlanguaging\naquine \nglossary-excercise?\nqualifiers (secure, bad, bourgeois, queer..)\n\nhealing\nrelational software observatory consultancy service\nretrospection\nAgile Sun Salutation\nhand reading\nwhen dirty.db gets dirty\n\nclose encounters\nvisiting a museum\ninterviews\nasking the same question\ngetting down in your computer functioning (files/processes/ram)\nrelational software observatory consultancy service\nwith your future?blobservation\n\nembodiment/body techniques\nAgile Sun Salutation: see Healing\nCOLLECTIVE CHAIR YOGA!!!\nfountain \ncomportment of software (occupational hazards)\n\ncollections\nbestiary of software logos (we collect)\ncomputer history museum (institutional collection)\njean heuns collection at leuven (personal/institutional)\nTesting the testbed: testing software with observatory ambitions\n\n\nbeingontheside/inthemiddle/behind\nsomethinginthemiddlemaybe\nelevator\nside channel attacks\n\nMethods for inadequate observation of software [inadequate methods?]\n\nbut then the things in these groupings can be arranged/divided by form? like descrptive entries/ exercises/ diagrams/ conversation with/ gloss/\n\nWARNINGS\n[[warning: \"our methods for observation, like mapping, come with their luggage.\" from Thursday afternoon section of http://observatory.constantvzw.org/etherdump/toc.md.diff.html ]]\n[[warning: some of these methods are not suitable for agile software/SaaS observation]]\n\n\n","attribs":"|1+1g+1e*0|1+1|2+1t*0*1+h*0|5+2j*0+1f*2|1+1*0|3+1j*0*1+7*0|d+pt*2|1+3e*0|5+7s*0+2o*2|3+18*0|2+1s*2|2+48*0|a+dr*4|4+4s*0|3+4j*0*1+8*0|1+1*2+1y*0|1+1*0+1g*4|1+1*6+1g*0|1+1*4|2+3j*0|1+2g*0+e*0*1+m*0|2+2k*2|4+2n*2+a*0|4+4k*0*1+16*0|1+1*2|2+s*0|c+gm*4+11*0|3+n*0*1+12*0|3+11*4+11*0|5+3a*2|1+1*7+1f*0|7+d|5+1g+1h*0+9|1+1+1w*0+5|1+1+1a*0+18|2+3t+2p*0+6|du+io5*3|1+1|1+1"}}},"pad:observatory.methods:revs:2001":{"changeset":"Z:mpz>1|2q=3in=2w*0+1$C","meta":{"author":"a.ocPhP3HyN6Ppfg6m","timestamp":1515528122015}},"pad:observatory.methods:revs:2002":{"changeset":"Z:mq0>3|2q=3in=2x*0+3$arl","meta":{"author":"a.ocPhP3HyN6Ppfg6m","timestamp":1515528123112}},"pad:observatory.methods:revs:2003":{"changeset":"Z:mq3>1|2s=3lp=1f*7+1$ ","meta":{"author":"a.CLJqMQchPGX2f376","timestamp":1515528123852}},"pad:observatory.methods:revs:2004":{"changeset":"Z:mq4>1|2s=3lp=1g*7+1$y","meta":{"author":"a.CLJqMQchPGX2f376","timestamp":1515528124353}},"pad:observatory.methods:revs:2005":{"changeset":"Z:mq5>4|2q=3in=30*0+4$in, ","meta":{"author":"a.ocPhP3HyN6Ppfg6m","timestamp":1515528124691}},"pad:observatory.methods:revs:2006":{"changeset":"Z:mq9>2|2s=3lt=1h*7+2$ou","meta":{"author":"a.CLJqMQchPGX2f376","timestamp":1515528124853}},"pad:observatory.methods:revs:2007":{"changeset":"Z:mqb>3|2s=3lt=1j*7+3$ fe","meta":{"author":"a.CLJqMQchPGX2f376","timestamp":1515528125359}},"pad:observatory.methods:revs:2008":{"changeset":"Z:mqe>4|2s=3lt=1m*7+4$el a","meta":{"author":"a.CLJqMQchPGX2f376","timestamp":1515528125863}},"pad:observatory.methods:revs:2009":{"changeset":"Z:mqi>5|2q=3in=34*0+5$Peggy","meta":{"author":"a.ocPhP3HyN6Ppfg6m","timestamp":1515528125872}},"pad:observatory.methods:revs:201":{"changeset":"Z:jpo<4|9=8l=j-4$","meta":{"author":"a.ocPhP3HyN6Ppfg6m","timestamp":1515524986813}},"pad:observatory.methods:revs:2010":{"changeset":"Z:mqn>6|2s=3ly=1q*7+6$re mis","meta":{"author":"a.CLJqMQchPGX2f376","timestamp":1515528126381}},"pad:observatory.methods:revs:2011":{"changeset":"Z:mqt>4|2s=3ly=1w*7+4$sing","meta":{"author":"a.CLJqMQchPGX2f376","timestamp":1515528126875}},"pad:observatory.methods:revs:2012":{"changeset":"Z:mqx>2|2q=3in=39*0+2$, ","meta":{"author":"a.ocPhP3HyN6Ppfg6m","timestamp":1515528127233}},"pad:observatory.methods:revs:2013":{"changeset":"Z:mqz>2|2s=3m0=20*7+2$.

Editing glossary.\nQuestion: what about this warning:\nhttp://pad.constantvzw.org/p/observatory.guide.warning -- it is a meta-warning that should go first? (now under the essentials)\nShe Does Not Feel Lost.\nWhat scale of conversation? Intro could do with some tweaking, but in general works.\nRead through half of the methods. Feels familiar. Need to hand it to interested people that were not at the workshop.\nSend this to people that were at TGSO first.\nLikes the mix: Conversational and some more 'technical'.\n\nSeda also had a look -- some things to add and remove ... introduction (stops with freelancer-utopia, but what about turkers, clickworkers, on-line task workers ...)\nMight need something on services in the clinic description. Some humor!\nIn general: we could be funnier and more surreal! Funny + sharp. Could use some edge. \"We cannot be funny with software right now\"\nDatabases of populations (El Salvadoreans about to be deported, India's biometric database being sold to journalists etc)\nEmergency ... games of words. Needs some push.\nContinuous integration missing from html?\n\nhttps://pad.constantvzw.org/p/observatory.guide.introduction\nTension in the introduction. First: critical distance, then entanglement. Need to name it/connect it. Helps to tie in the quote?\nLater: \"going beyond\" ... MMo -- need to reformulate. Make quote (why it is there) more xplicit.\nDistance can be critical but not always. \n\n\nWork a bit more on the introduction, this can work on its own?\nSo the text should be a text to be read that stands on its own and does work on its own. \nMaybe the introduction needs to be more explicitly political.\n\nSeda looked for methods -- there are some missing. Christoph will make them appear!\nAlso: if we open to others, they will bring new energy.\nCalendar App Collapsing!\nPeggy: we can do this on the 9th? Or maybe not. \nSeda: separate time for sharpening the introduction, to keep serioussnes and humor together.\n\nCluster descriptions not done yet/not in the html. Should we write them or use quotes?\nSome Humor Can Go Here.\nNeeds writing -- we tried using quotes only, but it does not work for all.\n\nhttp://pad.constantvzw.org/p/observatory.guide.grouping.temporality\nhttp://pad.constantvzw.org/p/observatory.guide.grouping.languaging\nillustrations to open the groupings\nWorks well with the design! So, make mixes of images/quotes and some writing.\nCarlin: it does not need to be a lot ... one or two words. Titles already do a lot.\n\nAppendix\nPeggy has done the interview and will do the transciption by next week\nMeeting was very nice! New stories added. Anecdotes.\n(CH: what about the interview, where/how to put it?)\nLet's just put it into the https://pad.constantvzw.org/p/observatory.guide.jean.heuns pad\ndon't mind the formatting right now.\nAn hour of conversation. Keeping all of it? An excerpt? Use extracts through the quide.\nDecide on the 9th of February 2018 ?\nPeggy will do the transcription anyways. CH + FS think it could work well, different pace.\n\nWhat other extra materials could go in an Appendix?\nthe full interview Peggy did\nJogi's email\nWhat else?\nHans text on time: wanted to work on the text -- finished by 9th of February\nAnita: wrote on punchcards, needs to be finished ... a short version would be nice!!\n\nChristoph advanced on processing the pads:\nChristoph is \"pretty fine\"\n\ndifferent parts, different treatments. Now very basic.\n\nhttp://observatory.constantvzw.org/tgsoguide.html\nhttp://observatory.constantvzw.org/\n-> tgsoguide_1801091008.pdf\n\nTo get an overview regarding the current state of editing the html output works better as the pdf requires more work on the details and layout, which still needs to be done. To keep track of things to be done I added a temporary '% TODO:' \n\nFYI: http://gitlab.constantvzw.org/ch/observatory.guide\n\nTech question: intake form ... could we link it, how does it work? How to integrate documents (like pdfs)?\nwrite in your pad ...\n% TODO: include pdf here linktothepdf\nand CH will look :-)\n\nIncluding other TGSO people: an email!\n- specific questions\n- general call\n- make little howto (until net week?)\n\nDear all,\n\nIt has been a while since we ended the Walk-in clinic wit agile yoga! In the mean time, Anita, Martino, Carlin, Peggy, Seda, Michael, Femke have been joined by Christoph to work on The Guide To Technogalactic Software observing.\n\nWe have been trying to put together a collection that is b, to add materials and/or add methods you feel are missing. \nhow to\n\n\n\n\n\nLAST ROUNDS 2 DECEMBER\n\nPlanning\n\nBefore January 9:\n- Finish descriptions of clusters (Martino? + Femke?)

Do we want it to be of use? The difference between documentation and publication is the imagined audience\ndocumentation: audience is the participants, does not have the ambition to be legible to non-participants\npublication: a broader audience (with contributions from other participants but not from those who did not participate in the work session) who would be able to pick it up and understand the techno-galactic condition\n\n\nCan we decide on a few kinds of formats and test them\n- one can be a breakdown like on the methods list\n- one can be more just description/summary/exericse\n\nwe look at the methods\nand other forms of documentation\nsee if the proposed structure works\nspecifically:\n*test: make a round of groupings / hierarchies affinities\n*test: make more methods\n*test: other templates\n*\n7:20 CET back to discuss\n\nPeggy:\n\nFor the interview ... something that could be easily done, short bio interview with 2-3 q to the participants.

What software category does it apply to agile/SaaS?]\n*Who: [who/what gets to observe]\n*Why: [what is the engagement, of the observer with the observed and vice versa]\n*Note: [anything that did not fit above.]\n\n*Method: Testing the testbed: testing software with observatory ambitions (SWOA)\n*By/history/source/origin/process: the \"original testbed\" was proposed by researchers/collaborators in Princeton. Testing this testbed at a local Constant workshop led to the meta-project of testing software meant for testing software. \n*How: The interwebs hosts many projects that aim to produce software for observing software, (from now on Software With Observatory Ambitions (SWOA)). A comparative methodology can be produced by using different SWOA to observe software of interest. Example: use different sniffing software to observe wireless networks. Doing so reveals what is seen as worthy of observation (e.g., what protocols, what space, which devices), the granularity of the observation (e.g., how is the observation captured, in what detail), the logo and conceptual framework of choice etc. \n*Where/when/situation?: Ideally, SWOA can be used everywhere. In reality, institutions, laws and administrators like to control the use of SWOA on infrastructures not also run by the people running it. Hence, we get distinctions like researchers and pen testers (e.g., they were hired) vs. hackers. \n*What: Deep philosophical moment: most software has a recursive observatory ambition (it wants to be observed in its execution, output etc.). Debuggers, logs, dashboards are all instances of software with observatory ambitions and can not be separated from software itself. So, what separates SWOA from software itself? HELP! \n*Who/with: If you can run the SWOA (many of these are promises more than running software/available code), you can do it. The question is: will people like it if you observe their SWOA?\n*Why/urgency/ [this is maybe related to the engagement question?]: If critical engagement in software is a thing, it follows that people would develop software to observe. \n*Note: [anything that did not fit above.]\n*WARNING: \n*REMEMBER: Good SWOA software usually uses an animal as a logo.:D\n*See also: making a bestiary of visual cultures/logos around it\n\n*Method: Rearranging space as conditioning observations (WTC vs. Museum vs. University vs. Startup Office vs. Shifting Walls that became Water Fountains)\n*By: [who developed, tested, proposed this method]\n*How: [ideas for how the observation method can be applied]\n*Where/when: [in what situation, space, circumstances does the observation take place]\n*What: [what/who gets observed.

Some of the play would come in from the mix of recognizable and common methods (visit a museum (ie. Namur and Leuven), conduct interviews (ie. with Jean Heuns but also as Relational software observatory consultancy service), organize and hold a worksession (ie. what we did), listen to an expert (ie.

Editing glossary.\nQuestion: what about this warning:\nhttp://pad.constantvzw.org/p/observatory.guide.warning -- it is a meta-warning that should go first? (now under the essentials)\nShe Does Not Feel Lost.\nWhat scale of conversation? Intro could do with some tweaking, but in general works.\nRead through half of the methods. Feels familiar. Need to hand it to interested people that were not at the workshop.\nSend this to people that were at TGSO first.\nLikes the mix: Conversational and some more 'technical'.\n\nSeda also had a look -- some things to add and remove ... introduction (stops with freelancer-utopia, but what about turkers, clickworkers, on-line task workers ...)\nMight need something on services in the clinic description. Some humor!\nIn general: we could be funnier and more surreal! Funny + sharp. Could use some edge. \"We cannot be funny with software right now\"\nDatabases of populations (El Salvadoreans about to be deported, India's biometric database being sold to journalists etc)\nEmergency ... games of words. Needs some push.\nContinuous integration missing from html?\n\nhttps://pad.constantvzw.org/p/observatory.guide.introduction\nTension in the introduction. First: critical distance, then entanglement. Need to name it/connect it. Helps to tie in the quote?\nLater: \"going beyond\" ... MMo -- need to reformulate. Make quote (why it is there) more xplicit.\nDistance can be critical but not always. \n\n\nWork a bit more on the introduction, this can work on its own?\nSo the text should be a text to be read that stands on its own and does work on its own. \nMaybe the introduction needs to be more explicitly political.\n\nSeda looked for methods -- there are some missing. Christoph will make them appear!\nAlso: if we open to others, they will bring new energy.\nCalendar App Collapsing!\nPeggy: we can do this on the 9th? Or maybe not. \nSeda: separate time for sharpening the introduction, to keep serioussnes and humor together.\n\nCluster descriptions not done yet/not in the html. Should we write them or use quotes?\nSome Humor Can Go Here.\nNeeds writing -- we tried using quotes only, but it does not work for all.\n\nhttp://pad.constantvzw.org/p/observatory.guide.grouping.temporality\nhttp://pad.constantvzw.org/p/observatory.guide.grouping.languaging\nillustrations to open the groupings\nWorks well with the design! So, make mixes of images/quotes and some writing.\nCarlin: it does not need to be a lot ... one or two words. Titles already do a lot.\n\nAppendix\nPeggy has done the interview and will do the transciption by next week\nMeeting was very nice! New stories added. Anecdotes.\n(CH: what about the interview, where/how to put it?)\nLet's just put it into the https://pad.constantvzw.org/p/observatory.guide.jean.heuns pad\ndon't mind the formatting right now.\nAn hour of conversation. Keeping all of it? An excerpt? Use extracts through the quide.\nDecide on the 9th of February 2018 ?\nPeggy will do the transcription anyways. CH + FS think it could work well, different pace.\n\nWhat other extra materials could go in an Appendix?\nthe full interview Peggy did\nJogi's email\nWhat else?\nHans text on time: wanted to work on the text -- finished by 9th of February\nAnita: wrote on punchcards, needs to be finished ... a short version would be nice!!\n\nChristoph advanced on processing the pads:\nChristoph is \"pretty fine\"\n\ndifferent parts, different treatments.

What software category does it apply to agile/SaaS?]\n*Who: [who/what gets to observe]\n*Why: [what is the engagement, of the observer with the observed and vice versa]\n*Note: [anything that did not fit above.]\n\n*Method: Testing the testbed: testing software with observatory ambitions (SWOA)\n*By/history/source/origin/process: the \"original testbed\" was proposed by researchers/collaborators in Princeton. Testing this testbed at a local Constant workshop led to the meta-project of testing software meant for testing software. \n*How: The interwebs hosts many projects that aim to produce software for observing software, (from now on Software With Observatory Ambitions (SWOA)). A comparative methodology can be produced by using different SWOA to observe software of interest. Example: use different sniffing software to observe wireless networks. Doing so reveals what is seen as worthy of observation (e.g., what protocols, what space, which devices), the granularity of the observation (e.g., how is the observation captured, in what detail), the logo and conceptual framework of choice etc. \n*Where/when/situation?: Ideally, SWOA can be used everywhere. In reality, institutions, laws and administrators like to control the use of SWOA on infrastructures not also run by the people running it. Hence, we get distinctions like researchers and pen testers (e.g., they were hired) vs. hackers. \n*What: Deep philosophical moment: most software has a recursive observatory ambition (it wants to be observed in its execution, output etc.). Debuggers, logs, dashboards are all instances of software with observatory ambitions and can not be separated from software itself. So, what separates SWOA from software itself? HELP! \n*Who/with: If you can run the SWOA (many of these are promises more than running software/available code), you can do it. The question is: will people like it if you observe their SWOA?\n*Why/urgency/ [this is maybe related to the engagement question?]: If critical engagement in software is a thing, it follows that people would develop software to observe. \n*Note: [anything that did not fit above.]\n*WARNING: \n*REMEMBER: Good SWOA software usually uses an animal as a logo.:D\n*See also: making a bestiary of visual cultures/logos around it\n\n*Method: Rearranging space as conditioning observations (WTC vs. Museum vs. University vs. Startup Office vs. Shifting Walls that became Water Fountains)\n*By: [who developed, tested, proposed this method]\n*How: [ideas for how the observation method can be applied]\n*Where/when: [in what situation, space, circumstances does the observation take place]\n*What: [what/who gets observed.

(now under the essentials)\nShe Does Not Feel Lost.\nWhat scale of conversation? Intro could do with some tweaking, but in general works.\nRead through half of the methods. Feels familiar. Need to hand it to interested people that were not at the workshop.\nSend this to people that were at TGSO first.\nLikes the mix: Conversational and some more 'technical'.\n\nSeda also had a look -- some things to add and remove ... introduction (stops with freelancer-utopia, but what about turkers, clickworkers, on-line task workers ...)\nMight need something on services in the clinic description. Some humor!\nIn general: we could be funnier and more surreal! Funny + sharp.

Make quote (why it is there) more xplicit.\nDistance can be critical but not always. \n\n\nWork a bit more on the introduction, this can work on its own?\nSo the text should be a text to be read that stands on its own and does work on its own. \nMaybe the introduction needs to be more explicitly political.\n\nSeda looked for methods -- there are some missing. Christoph will make them appear!\nAlso: if we open to others, they will bring new energy.\nCalendar App Collapsing!\nPeggy: we can do this on the 9th? Or maybe not. \nSeda: separate time for sharpening the introduction, to keep serioussnes and humor together.\n\nCluster descriptions not done yet/not in the html.

What software category does it apply to agile/SaaS?]\n*Who: [who/what gets to observe]\n*Why: [what is the engagement, of the observer with the observed and vice versa]\n*Note: [anything that did not fit above.]\n\n*Method: Testing the testbed: testing software with observatory ambitions (SWOA)\n*By/history/source/origin/process: the \"original testbed\" was proposed by researchers/collaborators in Princeton. Testing this testbed at a local Constant workshop led to the meta-project of testing software meant for testing software. \n*How: The interwebs hosts many projects that aim to produce software for observing software, (from now on Software With Observatory Ambitions (SWOA)). A comparative methodology can be produced by using different SWOA to observe software of interest. Example: use different sniffing software to observe wireless networks. Doing so reveals what is seen as worthy of observation (e.g., what protocols, what space, which devices), the granularity of the observation (e.g., how is the observation captured, in what detail), the logo and conceptual framework of choice etc. \n*Where/when/situation?: Ideally, SWOA can be used everywhere. In reality, institutions, laws and administrators like to control the use of SWOA on infrastructures not also run by the people running it. Hence, we get distinctions like researchers and pen testers (e.g., they were hired) vs. hackers. \n*What: Deep philosophical moment: most software has a recursive observatory ambition (it wants to be observed in its execution, output etc.). Debuggers, logs, dashboards are all instances of software with observatory ambitions and can not be separated from software itself. So, what separates SWOA from software itself? HELP! \n*Who/with: If you can run the SWOA (many of these are promises more than running software/available code), you can do it. The question is: will people like it if you observe their SWOA?\n*Why/urgency/ [this is maybe related to the engagement question?]: If critical engagement in software is a thing, it follows that people would develop software to observe. \n*Note: [anything that did not fit above.]\n*WARNING: \n*REMEMBER: Good SWOA software usually uses an animal as a logo.:D\n*See also: making a bestiary of visual cultures/logos around it\n\n*Method: Rearranging space as conditioning observations (WTC vs. Museum vs. University vs. Startup Office vs. Shifting Walls that became Water Fountains)\n*By: [who developed, tested, proposed this method]\n*How: [ideas for how the observation method can be applied]\n*Where/when: [in what situation, space, circumstances does the observation take place]\n*What: [what/who gets observed.

One way to handle the publication/documentation tension would be to structure a publication around a set of ways of knowing/methods and then select and shape documentation from the worksession as samples of these methods or taking moments from the workshop as prompts for reflection on these methods. Some of the play would come in from the mix of recognizable and common methods (visit a museum (ie. Namur and Leuven), conduct interviews (ie. with Jean Heuns but also as Relational software observatory consultancy service), organize and hold a worksession (ie. what we did), listen to an expert (ie. sidechannel)) with the less common ones (ie. create a bestiary of software logos, engaging with code through collective reading/performance, etc). \n\n\n\n\nChapters/sections\n\n-possible

Editing glossary.\nQuestion: what about this warning:\nhttp://pad.constantvzw.org/p/observatory.guide.warning -- it is a meta-warning that should go first? (now under the essentials)\nShe Does Not Feel Lost.\nWhat scale of conversation? Intro could do with some tweaking, but in general works.\nRead through half of the methods. Feels familiar. Need to hand it to interested people that were not at the workshop.\nSend this to people that were at TGSO first.\nLikes the mix: Conversational and some more 'technical'.\n\nSeda also had a look -- some things to add and remove ... introduction (stops with freelancer-utopia, but what about turkers, clickworkers, on-line task workers ...)\nMight need something on services in the clinic description. Some humor!\nIn general: we could be funnier and more surreal! Funny + sharp. Could use some edge. \"We cannot be funny with software right now\"\nDatabases of populations (El Salvadoreans about to be deported, India's biometric database being sold to journalists etc)\nEmergency ... games of words. Needs some push.\nContinuous integration missing from html?\n\nhttps://pad.constantvzw.org/p/observatory.guide.introduction\nTension in the introduction. First: critical distance, then entanglement. Need to name it/connect it. Helps to tie in the quote?\nLater: \"going beyond\" ... MMo -- need to reformulate. Make quote (why it is there) more xplicit.\nDistance can be critical but not always. \n\n\nWork a bit more on the introduction, this can work on its own?\nSo the text should be a text to be read that stands on its own and does work on its own. \nMaybe the introduction needs to be more explicitly political.\n\nSeda looked for methods -- there are some missing. Christoph will make them appear!\nAlso: if we open to others, they will bring new energy.\nCalendar App Collapsing!\nPeggy: we can do this on the 9th? Or maybe not. \nSeda: separate time for sharpening the introduction, to keep serioussnes and humor together.\n\nCluster descriptions not done yet/not in the html. Should we write them or use quotes?\nSome Humor Can Go Here.\nNeeds writing -- we tried using quotes only, but it does not work for all.\n\nhttp://pad.constantvzw.org/p/observatory.guide.grouping.temporality\nhttp://pad.constantvzw.org/p/observatory.guide.grouping.languaging\nillustrations to open the groupings\nWorks well with the design! So, make mixes of images/quotes and some writing.\nCarlin: it does not need to be a lot ... one or two words. Titles already do a lot.\n\nAppendix\nPeggy has done the interview and will do the transciption by next week\nMeeting was very nice! New stories added. Anecdotes.\n(CH: what about the interview, where/how to put it?)\nLet's just put it into the https://pad.constantvzw.org/p/observatory.guide.jean.heuns pad\ndon't mind the formatting right now.\nAn hour of conversation. Keeping all of it? An excerpt? Use extracts through the quide.\nDecide on the 9th of February 2018 ?\nPeggy will do the transcription anyways. CH + FS think it could work well, different pace.\n\nWhat other extra materials could go in an Appendix?\nthe full interview Peggy did\nJogi's email\nWhat else?\nHans text on time: wanted to work on the text -- finished by 9th of February\nAnita: wrote on punchcards, needs to be finished ... a short version would be nice!!\n\nChristoph advanced on processing the pads:\nChristoph is \"pretty fine\"\n\ndifferent parts, different treatments.

To keep track of things to be done I added a temporary '% TODO:' \n\nFYI: http://gitlab.constantvzw.org/ch/observatory.guide\n\nTech question: intake form ... could we link it, how does it work?

In the mean time, Anita, Martino, Carlin, Peggy, Seda, Michael, Femke have been joined by Christoph to work on The Guide To Technogalactic Software Observation.\n\nWe have been trying to put together a collection that is both documenting the session, and making a publication. As part of this we have created a list of methods for software observation that are drawn from the worksession documentation.While we are trying to reach some density and coherence, the guide does not aim for completeness. Rather we hope to give an impression of the variety of tones and materials that were manfie\n to add materials and/or add methods you feel are missing. \n\nYou can find the index here: (there is some markup added for generating the guide directly from pads, obviously)\n\nWe have a short window of time to \n\nIf you would like to contribute \n\n\nAnita as Madonna\nhttps://pad.constantvzw.org/p/observatory.guide.colophon\n\n\n\nLAST ROUNDS 2 DECEMBER\n\nPlanning\n\nBefore January 9:\n- Finish descriptions of clusters (Martino? + Femke?) NOT DONE\n- Finish introduction (Done for now? Maybe another round on Feb. 9?) DONE\n- Interview Jean Huens + transcription (Peggy) interview DONE, transcription next week Wed\n- Establish a level of editing that shows a balance between documentation and guidance (all of us try to finish the entries we took on)\n- Finish pdf to a point that no content is missing and we can start discussing design (Christoph) DONE!\n\nMeet January 9, 20h CET (1.5 hr meeting max)\n- See what still needs to be done\n- Send out e-mail to TGSO list: deadline 29 January\n\n[Carlin starts editing]\n\n9 February 12h CET: we meet to finish whatever needs to be done \nCarlin joins at 16h CET\n\nEnd February: print\nMain pads:\nhttp://pad.constantvzw.org/p/observatory.methods\nhttp://pad.constantvzw.org/p/observatory.guide\n\n---\n\nCarlin's questions\n- editing process\n*- different approach for primary materials (taken from workshop) vs framing materials created now\n*- in order to respect the documentation of the primary material (michael)\n*- how can this be a document that oscillates between \"look what cool methods we used and \"here are some things you could try out yourself\"\n\"If you are writing, you have liberties\" - if necessary, ask people who were involved in the thing to \n- order of entries\nhttp://pad.constantvzw.org/p/observatory.guide\n- incorporation of photographs, diagrams, etc\nYES!\n- small note (visit computer collections appears twice in the current html)\n(probably ok now?)\n\nlook for phrases / ways for introducing the chapters/groupings.

A task for someone?\nTest: http://pad.constantvzw.org/p/observatory.guide.grouping.temporality\n\nIntroduction http://pad.constantvzw.org/p/observatory.guide.introduction Peggy + FS + Seda first round\n\nAdd reference to the walk-in clinic? A description. Unlike normal guides: we have not removed the process. WARNING: there will be a mix of abstractions and concrete experiences.\n\nCarlin works on 3 entries\n\nThe interview needs to be done -> Peggy\n\nHans e-mail -> Martino\nAna + Ricardo -> Femke\n\nFor each of the chapter descriptions: quote from the materials/reader? Could be an image. Or a short inspirational phrase? -> Martino tries\nhttp://pad.constantvzw.org/p/observatory.guide\n\nAn email to other TGSO participants, call for help/see if further material is available (once the PDF is more stable)\n\nWARNING: pad fatigue might occur\n\nlatex todo:\n* be able to force empty new lines  (f.ex to put back lines in scrollresistance)\n* differentiate code quotes from pad quotes\n\n\n\n\n\nSAS Survival Handbook: The Ultimate Guide to Surviving Anywhere \nhttps://archive.org/stream/SASSurvivalHandbookTheUltimateGuideToSurvivingAnywhere/AppNee.com.SAS.Survival.Handbook.2nd.Edition#page/n359/mode/2up\nThe  Rudiments Of Wisdom encyclopaedia by Tim Hunkin.\nhttp://www.rudimentsofwisdom.com\n\nissue: different materials. works well to situate the week. fr an interview, a good way to introduce. but with folders, code ... so brought the SAS guide.

What software category does it apply to agile/SaaS?]\n*Who: [who/what gets to observe]\n*Why: [what is the engagement, of the observer with the observed and vice versa]\n*Note: [anything that did not fit above.]\n\n*Method: Testing the testbed: testing software with observatory ambitions (SWOA)\n*By/history/source/origin/process: the \"original testbed\" was proposed by researchers/collaborators in Princeton. Testing this testbed at a local Constant workshop led to the meta-project of testing software meant for testing software. \n*How: The interwebs hosts many projects that aim to produce software for observing software, (from now on Software With Observatory Ambitions (SWOA)). A comparative methodology can be produced by using different SWOA to observe software of interest. Example: use different sniffing software to observe wireless networks. Doing so reveals what is seen as worthy of observation (e.g., what protocols, what space, which devices), the granularity of the observation (e.g., how is the observation captured, in what detail), the logo and conceptual framework of choice etc. \n*Where/when/situation?: Ideally, SWOA can be used everywhere. In reality, institutions, laws and administrators like to control the use of SWOA on infrastructures not also run by the people running it. Hence, we get distinctions like researchers and pen testers (e.g., they were hired) vs. hackers. \n*What: Deep philosophical moment: most software has a recursive observatory ambition (it wants to be observed in its execution, output etc.). Debuggers, logs, dashboards are all instances of software with observatory ambitions and can not be separated from software itself. So, what separates SWOA from software itself? HELP! \n*Who/with: If you can run the SWOA (many of these are promises more than running software/available code), you can do it. The question is: will people like it if you observe their SWOA?\n*Why/urgency/ [this is maybe related to the engagement question?]: If critical engagement in software is a thing, it follows that people would develop software to observe. \n*Note: [anything that did not fit above.]\n*WARNING: \n*REMEMBER: Good SWOA software usually uses an animal as a logo.:D\n*See also: making a bestiary of visual cultures/logos around it\n\n*Method: Rearranging space as conditioning observations (WTC vs. Museum vs. University vs. Startup Office vs. Shifting Walls that became Water Fountains)\n*By: [who developed, tested, proposed this method]\n*How: [ideas for how the observation method can be applied]\n*Where/when: [in what situation, space, circumstances does the observation take place]\n*What: [what/who gets observed.

Some of the play would come in from the mix of recognizable and common methods (visit a museum (ie. Namur and Leuven), conduct interviews (ie. with Jean Heuns but also as Relational software observatory consultancy service), organize and hold a worksession (ie. what we did), listen to an expert (ie.

Editing glossary.\nQuestion: what about this warning:\nhttp://pad.constantvzw.org/p/observatory.guide.warning -- it is a meta-warning that should go first? (now under the essentials)\nShe Does Not Feel Lost.\nWhat scale of conversation? Intro could do with some tweaking, but in general works.\nRead through half of the methods. Feels familiar. Need to hand it to interested people that were not at the workshop.\nSend this to people that were at TGSO first.\nLikes the mix: Conversational and some more 'technical'.\n\nSeda also had a look -- some things to add and remove ... introduction (stops with freelancer-utopia, but what about turkers, clickworkers, on-line task workers ...)\nMight need something on services in the clinic description. Some humor!\nIn general: we could be funnier and more surreal! Funny + sharp. Could use some edge. \"We cannot be funny with software right now\"\nDatabases of populations (El Salvadoreans about to be deported, India's biometric database being sold to journalists etc)\nEmergency ... games of words. Needs some push.\nContinuous integration missing from html?\n\nhttps://pad.constantvzw.org/p/observatory.guide.introduction\nTension in the introduction. First: critical distance, then entanglement. Need to name it/connect it. Helps to tie in the quote?\nLater: \"going beyond\" ... MMo -- need to reformulate. Make quote (why it is there) more xplicit.\nDistance can be critical but not always. \n\n\nWork a bit more on the introduction, this can work on its own?\nSo the text should be a text to be read that stands on its own and does work on its own. \nMaybe the introduction needs to be more explicitly political.\n\nSeda looked for methods -- there are some missing. Christoph will make them appear!\nAlso: if we open to others, they will bring new energy.\nCalendar App Collapsing!\nPeggy: we can do this on the 9th? Or maybe not. \nSeda: separate time for sharpening the introduction, to keep serioussnes and humor together.\n\nCluster descriptions not done yet/not in the html. Should we write them or use quotes?\nSome Humor Can Go Here.\nNeeds writing -- we tried using quotes only, but it does not work for all.\n\nhttp://pad.constantvzw.org/p/observatory.guide.grouping.temporality\nhttp://pad.constantvzw.org/p/observatory.guide.grouping.languaging\nillustrations to open the groupings\nWorks well with the design! So, make mixes of images/quotes and some writing.\nCarlin: it does not need to be a lot ... one or two words. Titles already do a lot.\n\nAppendix\nPeggy has done the interview and will do the transciption by next week\nMeeting was very nice! New stories added. Anecdotes.\n(CH: what about the interview, where/how to put it?)\nLet's just put it into the https://pad.constantvzw.org/p/observatory.guide.jean.heuns pad\ndon't mind the formatting right now.\nAn hour of conversation. Keeping all of it? An excerpt? Use extracts through the quide.\nDecide on the 9th of February 2018 ?\nPeggy will do the transcription anyways. CH + FS think it could work well, different pace.\n\nWhat other extra materials could go in an Appendix?\nthe full interview Peggy did\nJogi's email\nWhat else?\nHans text on time: wanted to work on the text -- finished by 9th of February\nAnita: wrote on punchcards, needs to be finished ... a short version would be nice!!\n\nChristoph advanced on processing the pads:\nChristoph is \"pretty fine\"\n\ndifferent parts, different treatments. Now very basic.\n\nhttp://observatory.constantvzw.org/tgsoguide.html\nhttp://observatory.constantvzw.org/\n-> tgsoguide_1801091008.pdf\n\nTo get an overview regarding the current state of editing the html output works better as the pdf requires more work on the details and layout, which still needs to be done. To keep track of things to be done I added a temporary '% TODO:' \n\nFYI: http://gitlab.constantvzw.org/ch/observatory.guide\n\nTech question: intake form ... could we link it, how does it work? How to integrate documents (like pdfs)?\nwrite in your pad ...\n% TODO: include pdf here linktothepdf\nand CH will look :-)\n\nIncluding other TGSO people: an email!\n- specific questions\n- general call\n- make little howto (until net week?)\n-make a back-up of the current version before the email goes out to the larger group\n\nDear all,\n\nIt has been a while since we ended the Walk-in clinic with agile yoga! In the mean time, Anita, Martino, Carlin, Peggy, Seda, Michael, Femke have been joined by Christoph to work on The Guide To Technogalactic Software Observation.\n\nWe have been trying to put together a collection that is both documenting the session, and making a publication. As part of this we have created a list of methods for software observation that are drawn from the worksession documentation. While we are trying to reach some density and coherence, the guide does not aim for completeness.

What software category does it apply to agile/SaaS?]\n*Who: [who/what gets to observe]\n*Why: [what is the engagement, of the observer with the observed and vice versa]\n*Note: [anything that did not fit above.]\n\n*Method: Testing the testbed: testing software with observatory ambitions (SWOA)\n*By/history/source/origin/process: the \"original testbed\" was proposed by researchers/collaborators in Princeton. Testing this testbed at a local Constant workshop led to the meta-project of testing software meant for testing software. \n*How: The interwebs hosts many projects that aim to produce software for observing software, (from now on Software With Observatory Ambitions (SWOA)). A comparative methodology can be produced by using different SWOA to observe software of interest. Example: use different sniffing software to observe wireless networks. Doing so reveals what is seen as worthy of observation (e.g., what protocols, what space, which devices), the granularity of the observation (e.g., how is the observation captured, in what detail), the logo and conceptual framework of choice etc. \n*Where/when/situation?: Ideally, SWOA can be used everywhere. In reality, institutions, laws and administrators like to control the use of SWOA on infrastructures not also run by the people running it. Hence, we get distinctions like researchers and pen testers (e.g., they were hired) vs. hackers. \n*What: Deep philosophical moment: most software has a recursive observatory ambition (it wants to be observed in its execution, output etc.). Debuggers, logs, dashboards are all instances of software with observatory ambitions and can not be separated from software itself. So, what separates SWOA from software itself? HELP! \n*Who/with: If you can run the SWOA (many of these are promises more than running software/available code), you can do it. The question is: will people like it if you observe their SWOA?\n*Why/urgency/ [this is maybe related to the engagement question?]: If critical engagement in software is a thing, it follows that people would develop software to observe. \n*Note: [anything that did not fit above.]\n*WARNING: \n*REMEMBER: Good SWOA software usually uses an animal as a logo.:D\n*See also: making a bestiary of visual cultures/logos around it\n\n*Method: Rearranging space as conditioning observations (WTC vs. Museum vs. University vs. Startup Office vs. Shifting Walls that became Water Fountains)\n*By: [who developed, tested, proposed this method]\n*How: [ideas for how the observation method can be applied]\n*Where/when: [in what situation, space, circumstances does the observation take place]\n*What: [what/who gets observed.

Some of the play would come in from the mix of recognizable and common methods (visit a museum (ie. Namur and Leuven), conduct interviews (ie. with Jean Heuns but also as Relational software observatory consultancy service), organize and hold a worksession (ie. what we did), listen to an expert (ie.

Editing glossary.\nQuestion: what about this warning:\nhttp://pad.constantvzw.org/p/observatory.guide.warning -- it is a meta-warning that should go first? (now under the essentials)\nShe Does Not Feel Lost.\nWhat scale of conversation? Intro could do with some tweaking, but in general works.\nRead through half of the methods. Feels familiar. Need to hand it to interested people that were not at the workshop.\nSend this to people that were at TGSO first.\nLikes the mix: Conversational and some more 'technical'.\n\nSeda also had a look -- some things to add and remove ... introduction (stops with freelancer-utopia, but what about turkers, clickworkers, on-line task workers ...)\nMight need something on services in the clinic description. Some humor!\nIn general: we could be funnier and more surreal! Funny + sharp. Could use some edge. \"We cannot be funny with software right now\"\nDatabases of populations (El Salvadoreans about to be deported, India's biometric database being sold to journalists etc)\nEmergency ... games of words.

Need to name it/connect it. Helps to tie in the quote?\nLater: \"going beyond\" ... MMo -- need to reformulate. Make quote (why it is there) more xplicit.\nDistance can be critical but not always. \n\n\nWork a bit more on the introduction, this can work on its own?\nSo the text should be a text to be read that stands on its own and does work on its own. \nMaybe the introduction needs to be more explicitly political.\n\nSeda looked for methods -- there are some missing. Christoph will make them appear!\nAlso: if we open to others, they will bring new energy.\nCalendar App Collapsing!\nPeggy: we can do this on the 9th? Or maybe not. \nSeda: separate time for sharpening the introduction, to keep serioussnes and humor together.\n\nCluster descriptions not done yet/not in the html.

In the mean time, Anita, Martino, Carlin, Peggy, Seda, Michael, Femke have been joined by Christoph to work on The Guide To Technogalactic Software Observation.\n\nWe have been trying to put together a collection that is both documenting the session, and making a publication. As part of this we have created a list of methods for software observation that are drawn from the worksession documentation. While we are trying to reach some density and coherence, the guide does not aim for completeness. Rather we hope to give an impression of the variety of tones and materials that were manifested during our 6 days together.\nNow that there is some basic structure for the guide, we would like to invite you, our fellow observers, to add materials and/or add methods you feel are missing. \nWe chose to show the materials in terms of methods for observation, hoping this loose frame welcomes irony and bending\n\nYou can find the index here with links to all contributions http://gitlab.constantvzw.org/ch/observatory.guide (there is some markup added for generating the guide directly from pads, obviously)\n\nWe have a short window of time to \n\nIf you would like to contribute we would like\n\n\n\n\n\nAnita as Madonna\nhttps://pad.constantvzw.org/p/observatory.guide.colophon\n\n\n\nLAST ROUNDS 2 DECEMBER\n\nPlanning\n\nBefore January 9:\n- Finish descriptions of clusters (Martino? + Femke?)

What software category does it apply to agile/SaaS?]\n*Who: [who/what gets to observe]\n*Why: [what is the engagement, of the observer with the observed and vice versa]\n*Note: [anything that did not fit above.]\n\n*Method: Testing the testbed: testing software with observatory ambitions (SWOA)\n*By/history/source/origin/process: the \"original testbed\" was proposed by researchers/collaborators in Princeton. Testing this testbed at a local Constant workshop led to the meta-project of testing software meant for testing software. \n*How: The interwebs hosts many projects that aim to produce software for observing software, (from now on Software With Observatory Ambitions (SWOA)). A comparative methodology can be produced by using different SWOA to observe software of interest. Example: use different sniffing software to observe wireless networks. Doing so reveals what is seen as worthy of observation (e.g., what protocols, what space, which devices), the granularity of the observation (e.g., how is the observation captured, in what detail), the logo and conceptual framework of choice etc. \n*Where/when/situation?: Ideally, SWOA can be used everywhere. In reality, institutions, laws and administrators like to control the use of SWOA on infrastructures not also run by the people running it. Hence, we get distinctions like researchers and pen testers (e.g., they were hired) vs. hackers. \n*What: Deep philosophical moment: most software has a recursive observatory ambition (it wants to be observed in its execution, output etc.). Debuggers, logs, dashboards are all instances of software with observatory ambitions and can not be separated from software itself. So, what separates SWOA from software itself? HELP! \n*Who/with: If you can run the SWOA (many of these are promises more than running software/available code), you can do it. The question is: will people like it if you observe their SWOA?\n*Why/urgency/ [this is maybe related to the engagement question?]: If critical engagement in software is a thing, it follows that people would develop software to observe. \n*Note: [anything that did not fit above.]\n*WARNING: \n*REMEMBER: Good SWOA software usually uses an animal as a logo.:D\n*See also: making a bestiary of visual cultures/logos around it\n\n*Method: Rearranging space as conditioning observations (WTC vs. Museum vs. University vs. Startup Office vs. Shifting Walls that became Water Fountains)\n*By: [who developed, tested, proposed this method]\n*How: [ideas for how the observation method can be applied]\n*Where/when: [in what situation, space, circumstances does the observation take place]\n*What: [what/who gets observed.

Editing glossary.\nQuestion: what about this warning:\nhttp://pad.constantvzw.org/p/observatory.guide.warning -- it is a meta-warning that should go first? (now under the essentials)\nShe Does Not Feel Lost.\nWhat scale of conversation? Intro could do with some tweaking, but in general works.\nRead through half of the methods. Feels familiar. Need to hand it to interested people that were not at the workshop.\nSend this to people that were at TGSO first.\nLikes the mix: Conversational and some more 'technical'.\n\nSeda also had a look -- some things to add and remove ... introduction (stops with freelancer-utopia, but what about turkers, clickworkers, on-line task workers ...)\nMight need something on services in the clinic description. Some humor!\nIn general: we could be funnier and more surreal! Funny + sharp. Could use some edge. \"We cannot be funny with software right now\"\nDatabases of populations (El Salvadoreans about to be deported, India's biometric database being sold to journalists etc)\nEmergency ... games of words. Needs some push.\nContinuous integration missing from html?\n\nhttps://pad.constantvzw.org/p/observatory.guide.introduction\nTension in the introduction. First: critical distance, then entanglement. Need to name it/connect it. Helps to tie in the quote?\nLater: \"going beyond\" ... MMo -- need to reformulate. Make quote (why it is there) more xplicit.\nDistance can be critical but not always. \n\n\nWork a bit more on the introduction, this can work on its own?\nSo the text should be a text to be read that stands on its own and does work on its own. \nMaybe the introduction needs to be more explicitly political.\n\nSeda looked for methods -- there are some missing. Christoph will make them appear!\nAlso: if we open to others, they will bring new energy.\nCalendar App Collapsing!\nPeggy: we can do this on the 9th? Or maybe not. \nSeda: separate time for sharpening the introduction, to keep serioussnes and humor together.\n\nCluster descriptions not done yet/not in the html. Should we write them or use quotes?\nSome Humor Can Go Here.\nNeeds writing -- we tried using quotes only, but it does not work for all.\n\nhttp://pad.constantvzw.org/p/observatory.guide.grouping.temporality\nhttp://pad.constantvzw.org/p/observatory.guide.grouping.languaging\nillustrations to open the groupings\nWorks well with the design! So, make mixes of images/quotes and some writing.\nCarlin: it does not need to be a lot ... one or two words. Titles already do a lot.\n\nAppendix\nPeggy has done the interview and will do the transciption by next week\nMeeting was very nice! New stories added. Anecdotes.\n(CH: what about the interview, where/how to put it?)\nLet's just put it into the https://pad.constantvzw.org/p/observatory.guide.jean.heuns pad\ndon't mind the formatting right now.\nAn hour of conversation. Keeping all of it? An excerpt? Use extracts through the quide.\nDecide on the 9th of February 2018 ?\nPeggy will do the transcription anyways. CH + FS think it could work well, different pace.\n\nWhat other extra materials could go in an Appendix?\nthe full interview Peggy did\nJogi's email\nWhat else?\nHans text on time: wanted to work on the text -- finished by 9th of February\nAnita: wrote on punchcards, needs to be finished ... a short version would be nice!!\n\nChristoph advanced on processing the pads:\nChristoph is \"pretty fine\"\n\ndifferent parts, different treatments.

In the mean time, Anita, Martino, Carlin, Peggy, Seda, Michael, Femke have been joined by Christoph to work on The Guide To Technogalactic Software Observation.\n\nWe have been trying to put together a collection that is both documenting the session, and making a publication. As part of this we have created a list of methods for software observation that are drawn from the worksession documentation. We chose to show the materials in terms of methods for observation, hoping this loose frame can welcome irony and bending.\nWhile we are trying to reach some density and coherence, the guide does not aim for completeness. Rather we hope to give an impression of the variety of tones and materials that were manifested during our 6 days together.\nNow that there is some basic structure for the guide, we would like to invite you, our fellow observers, to add materials and/or add methods you feel are missing. \n\n\nYou can find the index here with links to all contributions http://gitlab.constantvzw.org/ch/observatory.guide (there is some markup added for generating the guide directly from pads, obviously). You are welcome to update/complete/coo\n\nWe have a short window of time to put this together so that we can meet the publication dead. The deadline for contributions is January 29\n\n----\nSEND EMAIL MONDAY 15 JANUARY\n\n\nAnita as Madonna\nhttps://pad.constantvzw.org/p/observatory.guide.colophon\n\n\n\nLAST ROUNDS 2 DECEMBER\n\nPlanning\n\nBefore January 9:\n- Finish descriptions of clusters (Martino? + Femke?)

Do we want it to be of use? The difference between documentation and publication is the imagined audience\ndocumentation: audience is the participants, does not have the ambition to be legible to non-participants\npublication: a broader audience (with contributions from other participants but not from those who did not participate in the work session) who would be able to pick it up and understand the techno-galactic condition\n\n\nCan we decide on a few kinds of formats and test them\n- one can be a breakdown like on the methods list\n- one can be more just description/summary/exericse\n\nwe look at the methods\nand other forms of documentation\nsee if the proposed structure works\nspecifically:\n*test: make a round of groupings / hierarchies affinities\n*test: make more methods\n*test: other templates\n*\n7:20 CET back to discuss\n\nPeggy:\n\nFor the interview ... something that could be easily done, short bio interview with 2-3 q to the participants.

What software category does it apply to agile/SaaS?]\n*Who: [who/what gets to observe]\n*Why: [what is the engagement, of the observer with the observed and vice versa]\n*Note: [anything that did not fit above.]\n\n*Method: Testing the testbed: testing software with observatory ambitions (SWOA)\n*By/history/source/origin/process: the \"original testbed\" was proposed by researchers/collaborators in Princeton. Testing this testbed at a local Constant workshop led to the meta-project of testing software meant for testing software. \n*How: The interwebs hosts many projects that aim to produce software for observing software, (from now on Software With Observatory Ambitions (SWOA)). A comparative methodology can be produced by using different SWOA to observe software of interest. Example: use different sniffing software to observe wireless networks. Doing so reveals what is seen as worthy of observation (e.g., what protocols, what space, which devices), the granularity of the observation (e.g., how is the observation captured, in what detail), the logo and conceptual framework of choice etc. \n*Where/when/situation?: Ideally, SWOA can be used everywhere. In reality, institutions, laws and administrators like to control the use of SWOA on infrastructures not also run by the people running it. Hence, we get distinctions like researchers and pen testers (e.g., they were hired) vs. hackers. \n*What: Deep philosophical moment: most software has a recursive observatory ambition (it wants to be observed in its execution, output etc.). Debuggers, logs, dashboards are all instances of software with observatory ambitions and can not be separated from software itself. So, what separates SWOA from software itself? HELP! \n*Who/with: If you can run the SWOA (many of these are promises more than running software/available code), you can do it. The question is: will people like it if you observe their SWOA?\n*Why/urgency/ [this is maybe related to the engagement question?]: If critical engagement in software is a thing, it follows that people would develop software to observe. \n*Note: [anything that did not fit above.]\n*WARNING: \n*REMEMBER: Good SWOA software usually uses an animal as a logo.:D\n*See also: making a bestiary of visual cultures/logos around it\n\n*Method: Rearranging space as conditioning observations (WTC vs. Museum vs. University vs. Startup Office vs. Shifting Walls that became Water Fountains)\n*By: [who developed, tested, proposed this method]\n*How: [ideas for how the observation method can be applied]\n*Where/when: [in what situation, space, circumstances does the observation take place]\n*What: [what/who gets observed.

One way to handle the publication/documentation tension would be to structure a publication around a set of ways of knowing/methods and then select and shape documentation from the worksession as samples of these methods or taking moments from the workshop as prompts for reflection on these methods. Some of the play would come in from the mix of recognizable and common methods (visit a museum (ie. Namur and Leuven), conduct interviews (ie. with Jean Heuns but also as Relational software observatory consultancy service), organize and hold a worksession (ie. what we did), listen to an expert (ie. sidechannel)) with the less common ones (ie. create a bestiary of software logos, engaging with code through collective reading/performance, etc). \n\n\n\n\nChapters/sections\n\n-possible

--> 1-2 December\n\n9 JANUARY MEETING\n\nAgenda for tonight meeting: \nTHE INTERNATIONAL MEETING\n- See what still needs to be done\n- Send out e-mail to TGSO list: deadline 29 January\n\nMeet here at 20h CET https://meet.jit.si/observatory\n\nEditing\nCarlin has been reading, working on some items. Editing glossary.\nQuestion: what about this warning:\nhttp://pad.constantvzw.org/p/observatory.guide.warning -- it is a meta-warning that should go first? (now under the essentials)\nShe Does Not Feel Lost.\nWhat scale of conversation? Intro could do with some tweaking, but in general works.\nRead through half of the methods. Feels familiar. Need to hand it to interested people that were not at the workshop.\nSend this to people that were at TGSO first.\nLikes the mix: Conversational and some more 'technical'.\n\nSeda also had a look -- some things to add and remove ... introduction (stops with freelancer-utopia, but what about turkers, clickworkers, on-line task workers ...)\nMight need something on services in the clinic description. Some humor!\nIn general: we could be funnier and more surreal! Funny + sharp. Could use some edge. \"We cannot be funny with software right now\"\nDatabases of populations (El Salvadoreans about to be deported, India's biometric database being sold to journalists etc)\nEmergency ... games of words. Needs some push.\nContinuous integration missing from html?\n\nhttps://pad.constantvzw.org/p/observatory.guide.introduction\nTension in the introduction. First: critical distance, then entanglement. Need to name it/connect it. Helps to tie in the quote?\nLater: \"going beyond\" ... MMo -- need to reformulate. Make quote (why it is there) more xplicit.\nDistance can be critical but not always. \n\n\nWork a bit more on the introduction, this can work on its own?\nSo the text should be a text to be read that stands on its own and does work on its own. \nMaybe the introduction needs to be more explicitly political.\n\nSeda looked for methods -- there are some missing. Christoph will make them appear!\nAlso: if we open to others, they will bring new energy.\nCalendar App Collapsing!\nPeggy: we can do this on the 9th? Or maybe not. \nSeda: separate time for sharpening the introduction, to keep serioussnes and humor together.\n\nCluster descriptions not done yet/not in the html. Should we write them or use quotes?\nSome Humor Can Go Here.\nNeeds writing -- we tried using quotes only, but it does not work for all.\n\nhttp://pad.constantvzw.org/p/observatory.guide.grouping.temporality\nhttp://pad.constantvzw.org/p/observatory.guide.grouping.languaging\nillustrations to open the groupings\nWorks well with the design! So, make mixes of images/quotes and some writing.\nCarlin: it does not need to be a lot ... one or two words. Titles already do a lot.\n\nAppendix\nPeggy has done the interview and will do the transciption by next week\nMeeting was very nice! New stories added. Anecdotes.\n(CH: what about the interview, where/how to put it?)\nLet's just put it into the https://pad.constantvzw.org/p/observatory.guide.jean.heuns pad\ndon't mind the formatting right now.\nAn hour of conversation. Keeping all of it? An excerpt? Use extracts through the quide.\nDecide on the 9th of February 2018 ?\nPeggy will do the transcription anyways. CH + FS think it could work well, different pace.\n\nWhat other extra materials could go in an Appendix?\nthe full interview Peggy did\nJogi's email\nWhat else?\nHans text on time: wanted to work on the text -- finished by 9th of February\nAnita: wrote on punchcards, needs to be finished ... a short version would be nice!!\n\nChristoph advanced on processing the pads:\nChristoph is \"pretty fine\"\n\ndifferent parts, different treatments. Now very basic.\n\nhttp://observatory.constantvzw.org/tgsoguide.html\nhttp://observatory.constantvzw.org/\n-> tgsoguide_1801091008.pdf\n\nTo get an overview regarding the current state of editing the html output works better as the pdf requires more work on the details and layout, which still needs to be done. To keep track of things to be done I added a temporary '% TODO:' \n\nFYI: http://gitlab.constantvzw.org/ch/observatory.guide\n\nTech question: intake form ... could we link it, how does it work? How to integrate documents (like pdfs)?\nwrite in your pad ...\n% TODO: include pdf here linktothepdf\nand CH will look :-)\n\nIncluding other TGSO people: an email!\n- specific questions\n- general call\n- make little howto (until next week?)\n- make a back-up of the current version before the email goes out to the larger group\n\nDear all,\n\nIt has been a while since we ended the Walk-in clinic with agile yoga! In the mean time, Anita, Martino, Carlin, Peggy, Seda, Michael, Femke have been joined by Christoph to work on The Guide To Technogalactic Software Observation.\n\nWe have been trying to put together a collection that is both documenting the session, and making a publication. As part of this we have created a list of methods for software observation that are drawn from the worksession documentation. We chose to show the materials in terms of methods for observation, hoping this loose frame can welcome irony and bending.\nWhile we are trying to reach some density and coherence, the guide does not aim for completeness. Rather we hope to give an impression of the variety of tones and materials that were manifested during our 6 days together.\nNow that there is some basic structure for the guide, we would like to invite you, our fellow observers, to add materials and/or add methods you feel are missing. \n\nIf you fe\n\nYou can find the index here with links to all contributions http://pad.constantvzw.org/p/observatory.guide (there is some markup added for generating the guide directly from pads, obviously). You are welcome to update/complete/correct existing items or to add new ones; if you want to start a new one just copy \n\n\nIf you would like to make use of our notes from the worksession, you can find the pages indexed here: http://observatory.constantvzw.org/etherdump/_new_index.html\nWe have only a short window of time to put this together so that we can meet the publication deadline. The deadline for your contributions is January 29\n\n----\nSEND EMAIL MONDAY 15 JANUARY\n\n\nAnita as Madonna\nhttps://pad.constantvzw.org/p/observatory.guide.colophon\n\n\n\nLAST ROUNDS 2 DECEMBER\n\nPlanning\n\nBefore January 9:\n- Finish descriptions of clusters (Martino? + Femke?) NOT DONE\n- Finish introduction (Done for now? Maybe another round on Feb. 9?) DONE\n- Interview Jean Huens + transcription (Peggy) interview DONE, transcription next week Wed\n- Establish a level of editing that shows a balance between documentation and guidance (all of us try to finish the entries we took on)\n- Finish pdf to a point that no content is missing and we can start discussing design (Christoph) DONE!\n\nMeet January 9, 20h CET (1.5 hr meeting max)\n- See what still needs to be done\n- Send out e-mail to TGSO list: deadline 29 January\n\n[Carlin starts editing]\n\n9 February 12h CET: we meet to finish whatever needs to be done \nCarlin joins at 16h CET\n\nEnd February: print\nMain pads:\nhttp://pad.constantvzw.org/p/observatory.methods\nhttp://pad.constantvzw.org/p/observatory.guide\n\n---\n\nCarlin's questions\n- editing process\n*- different approach for primary materials (taken from workshop) vs framing materials created now\n*- in order to respect the documentation of the primary material (michael)\n*- how can this be a document that oscillates between \"look what cool methods we used and \"here are some things you could try out yourself\"\n\"If you are writing, you have liberties\" - if necessary, ask people who were involved in the thing to \n- order of entries\nhttp://pad.constantvzw.org/p/observatory.guide\n- incorporation of photographs, diagrams, etc\nYES!\n- small note (visit computer collections appears twice in the current html)\n(probably ok now?)\n\nlook for phrases / ways for introducing the chapters/groupings. Could be just a line? A task for someone?\nTest: http://pad.constantvzw.org/p/observatory.guide.grouping.temporality\n\nIntroduction http://pad.constantvzw.org/p/observatory.guide.introduction Peggy + FS + Seda first round\n\nAdd reference to the walk-in clinic? A description. Unlike normal guides: we have not removed the process. WARNING: there will be a mix of abstractions and concrete experiences.\n\nCarlin works on 3 entries\n\nThe interview needs to be done -> Peggy\n\nHans e-mail -> Martino\nAna + Ricardo -> Femke\n\nFor each of the chapter descriptions: quote from the materials/reader? Could be an image. Or a short inspirational phrase? -> Martino tries\nhttp://pad.constantvzw.org/p/observatory.guide\n\nAn email to other TGSO participants, call for help/see if further material is available (once the PDF is more stable)\n\nWARNING: pad fatigue might occur\n\nlatex todo:\n* be able to force empty new lines  (f.ex to put back lines in scrollresistance)\n* differentiate code quotes from pad quotes\n\n\n\n\n\nSAS Survival Handbook: The Ultimate Guide to Surviving Anywhere \nhttps://archive.org/stream/SASSurvivalHandbookTheUltimateGuideToSurvivingAnywhere/AppNee.com.SAS.Survival.Handbook.2nd.Edition#page/n359/mode/2up\nThe  Rudiments Of Wisdom encyclopaedia by Tim Hunkin.\nhttp://www.rudimentsofwisdom.com\n\nissue: different materials. works well to situate the week. fr an interview, a good way to introduce. but with folders, code ... so brought the SAS guide. What is good about that it is very loose ... different layers, zooms ... \nflowing things from one into the other .. not too formulaic. find ways to jump different tones.\nmultiplicity of tones. so ... something in-between the two\n\ntemplate as a way to make the connection back to the original questions ... what are the things to pay attention to, to give space to it.\n\nwe did not do any grouping, but maybe that could be interesting to try?\n\nwe were testing observatory method, the chronological order to prevent us from paying too much attention to the clinic and would also look at the exercises and thinking from the first days. \n\ncould each method then propose its form/content?\n\neven to have chapters that have no entry or only an introduction and no methods, to play the templating without feeling that we have to fulfil that template \n\nhttp://observatory.constantvzw.org/documents/mia/mia6.gif\n\nnoise is back,\n\ntest: make a round of groupings / hierarchies affinities\ntest: make more methods\ntest: other templates\n\nseda wondering about us defining different types of participants: stationary (that's us), migratory (but some stayed), walk-in (visitors to the clinic), sedentary ... was that a method?\ndo all the methods need to be related to software? YES but WHAT IS SOFTWARE\n\nsing through and to the hardware and software\n\nwhat is the 'entrypoint'(element from inventory?)-method relation\nmethods as a way to label and address things, still keeping open to other materials to enter (ie interview..)\n\nEverything in the guide is a METHOD, but how do we group and groom the methods???\n\nDo we do a publication, an event .. the fact that we have been through an event, and even that we describe it, means we are developing the methods.<- is this like observation transforms the method!?\nSo: is this documentation, or will we open it to new input. Ongoing.\n\nDifference between documentation and publication\n\nExampe: e-mail of jogi. \nThat report is already published and structured? It is an easier ongoingness -- to accept other contrib\n\nongoingness? thinking it structured around the week, and its participants. if you have not been involved, it is difficult to understand?\n\nWho is it for? Do we want it to be of use? The difference between documentation and publication is the imagined audience\ndocumentation: audience is the participants, does not have the ambition to be legible to non-participants\npublication: a broader audience (with contributions from other participants but not from those who did not participate in the work session) who would be able to pick it up and understand the techno-galactic condition\n\n\nCan we decide on a few kinds of formats and test them\n- one can be a breakdown like on the methods list\n- one can be more just description/summary/exericse\n\nwe look at the methods\nand other forms of documentation\nsee if the proposed structure works\nspecifically:\n*test: make a round of groupings / hierarchies affinities\n*test: make more methods\n*test: other templates\n*\n7:20 CET back to discuss\n\nPeggy:\n\nFor the interview ... something that could be easily done, short bio interview with 2-3 q to the participants. Easy to do, and a bit is already done in the introductions. Would be good to have it in the guide for people that have not been involved. Carlin likes this too!\nP. still likes to do long interview with mr. Huens.\nWould like to write down the visit to the museum as an 19th century explorer .\n\nMartino: groupings can certainly work. It can work, and connections are interesting.

A comparative methodology can be produced by using different SWOA to observe software of interest. Example: use different sniffing software to observe wireless networks. Doing so reveals what is seen as worthy of observation (e.g., what protocols, what space, which devices), the granularity of the observation (e.g., how is the observation captured, in what detail), the logo and conceptual framework of choice etc. \n*Where/when/situation?: Ideally, SWOA can be used everywhere. In reality, institutions, laws and administrators like to control the use of SWOA on infrastructures not also run by the people running it. Hence, we get distinctions like researchers and pen testers (e.g., they were hired) vs. hackers. \n*What: Deep philosophical moment: most software has a recursive observatory ambition (it wants to be observed in its execution, output etc.). Debuggers, logs, dashboards are all instances of software with observatory ambitions and can not be separated from software itself. So, what separates SWOA from software itself? HELP! \n*Who/with: If you can run the SWOA (many of these are promises more than running software/available code), you can do it. The question is: will people like it if you observe their SWOA?\n*Why/urgency/ [this is maybe related to the engagement question?]: If critical engagement in software is a thing, it follows that people would develop software to observe. \n*Note: [anything that did not fit above.]\n*WARNING: \n*REMEMBER: Good SWOA software usually uses an animal as a logo.:D\n*See also: making a bestiary of visual cultures/logos around it\n\n*Method: Rearranging space as conditioning observations (WTC vs. Museum vs. University vs. Startup Office vs. Shifting Walls that became Water Fountains)\n*By: [who developed, tested, proposed this method]\n*How: [ideas for how the observation method can be applied]\n*Where/when: [in what situation, space, circumstances does the observation take place]\n*What: [what/who gets observed.

One way to handle the publication/documentation tension would be to structure a publication around a set of ways of knowing/methods and then select and shape documentation from the worksession as samples of these methods or taking moments from the workshop as prompts for reflection on these methods. Some of the play would come in from the mix of recognizable and common methods (visit a museum (ie. Namur and Leuven), conduct interviews (ie. with Jean Heuns but also as Relational software observatory consultancy service), organize and hold a worksession (ie. what we did), listen to an expert (ie.

Editing glossary.\nQuestion: what about this warning:\nhttp://pad.constantvzw.org/p/observatory.guide.warning -- it is a meta-warning that should go first? (now under the essentials)\nShe Does Not Feel Lost.\nWhat scale of conversation? Intro could do with some tweaking, but in general works.\nRead through half of the methods. Feels familiar. Need to hand it to interested people that were not at the workshop.\nSend this to people that were at TGSO first.\nLikes the mix: Conversational and some more 'technical'.\n\nSeda also had a look -- some things to add and remove ... introduction (stops with freelancer-utopia, but what about turkers, clickworkers, on-line task workers ...)\nMight need something on services in the clinic description. Some humor!\nIn general: we could be funnier and more surreal! Funny + sharp. Could use some edge. \"We cannot be funny with software right now\"\nDatabases of populations (El Salvadoreans about to be deported, India's biometric database being sold to journalists etc)\nEmergency ... games of words. Needs some push.\nContinuous integration missing from html?\n\nhttps://pad.constantvzw.org/p/observatory.guide.introduction\nTension in the introduction. First: critical distance, then entanglement. Need to name it/connect it. Helps to tie in the quote?\nLater: \"going beyond\" ... MMo -- need to reformulate. Make quote (why it is there) more xplicit.\nDistance can be critical but not always. \n\n\nWork a bit more on the introduction, this can work on its own?\nSo the text should be a text to be read that stands on its own and does work on its own. \nMaybe the introduction needs to be more explicitly political.\n\nSeda looked for methods -- there are some missing. Christoph will make them appear!\nAlso: if we open to others, they will bring new energy.\nCalendar App Collapsing!\nPeggy: we can do this on the 9th? Or maybe not. \nSeda: separate time for sharpening the introduction, to keep serioussnes and humor together.\n\nCluster descriptions not done yet/not in the html. Should we write them or use quotes?\nSome Humor Can Go Here.\nNeeds writing -- we tried using quotes only, but it does not work for all.\n\nhttp://pad.constantvzw.org/p/observatory.guide.grouping.temporality\nhttp://pad.constantvzw.org/p/observatory.guide.grouping.languaging\nillustrations to open the groupings\nWorks well with the design! So, make mixes of images/quotes and some writing.\nCarlin: it does not need to be a lot ... one or two words. Titles already do a lot.\n\nAppendix\nPeggy has done the interview and will do the transciption by next week\nMeeting was very nice! New stories added. Anecdotes.\n(CH: what about the interview, where/how to put it?)\nLet's just put it into the https://pad.constantvzw.org/p/observatory.guide.jean.heuns pad\ndon't mind the formatting right now.\nAn hour of conversation. Keeping all of it? An excerpt? Use extracts through the quide.\nDecide on the 9th of February 2018 ?\nPeggy will do the transcription anyways. CH + FS think it could work well, different pace.\n\nWhat other extra materials could go in an Appendix?\nthe full interview Peggy did\nJogi's email\nWhat else?\nHans text on time: wanted to work on the text -- finished by 9th of February\nAnita: wrote on punchcards, needs to be finished ... a short version would be nice!!\n\nChristoph advanced on processing the pads:\nChristoph is \"pretty fine\"\n\ndifferent parts, different treatments. Now very basic.\n\nhttp://observatory.constantvzw.org/tgsoguide.html\nhttp://observatory.constantvzw.org/\n-> tgsoguide_1801091008.pdf\n\nTo get an overview regarding the current state of editing the html output works better as the pdf requires more work on the details and layout, which still needs to be done. To keep track of things to be done I added a temporary '% TODO:' \n\nFYI: http://gitlab.constantvzw.org/ch/observatory.guide\n\nTech question: intake form ... could we link it, how does it work? How to integrate documents (like pdfs)?\nwrite in your pad ...\n% TODO: include pdf here linktothepdf\nand CH will look :-)\n\nIncluding other TGSO people: an email!\n- specific questions\n- general call\n- make little howto (until next week?)\n- make a back-up of the current version before the email goes out to the larger group\n\nDear all,\n\nIt has been a while since we ended the Walk-in clinic with agile yoga! In the mean time, Anita, Martino, Carlin, Peggy, Seda, Michael, Femke have been joined by Christoph to work on The Guide To Technogalactic Software Observation.\n\nWe have been trying to put together a collection that is both documenting the session, and making a publication. As part of this we have created a list of methods for software observation that are drawn from the worksession documentation. We chose to show the materials in terms of methods for observation, hoping this loose frame can welcome irony and bending.\nWhile we are trying to reach some density and coherence, the guide does not aim for completeness. Rather we hope to give an impression of the variety of tones and materials that were manifested during our 6 days together.\nNow that there is some basic structure for the guide, we would like to invite you, our fellow observers, to add materials and/or add methods you feel are missing. \n\nYou can find the index here with links to all contributions http://pad.constantvzw.org/p/observatory.guide (there is some markup added for generating the guide directly from pads, obviously). You are welcome to update/complete/correct existing items or to add new ones.\n\nSome examples of more or less 'complete' methods that you can copy from: https://pad.constantvzw.org/p/observatory.guide.agile.yoga , https://pad.constantvzw.org/p/observatory.guide.somethinginthemiddlemaybe\n\nIf you would like to make use of our notes from the worksession, you can find the pages indexed here: http://observatory.constantvzw.org/etherdump/_new_index.html\nWe have only a short window of time to put this together so that we can meet the publication deadline.

What software category does it apply to agile/SaaS?]\n*Who: [who/what gets to observe]\n*Why: [what is the engagement, of the observer with the observed and vice versa]\n*Note: [anything that did not fit above.]\n\n*Method: Testing the testbed: testing software with observatory ambitions (SWOA)\n*By/history/source/origin/process: the \"original testbed\" was proposed by researchers/collaborators in Princeton. Testing this testbed at a local Constant workshop led to the meta-project of testing software meant for testing software. \n*How: The interwebs hosts many projects that aim to produce software for observing software, (from now on Software With Observatory Ambitions (SWOA)). A comparative methodology can be produced by using different SWOA to observe software of interest. Example: use different sniffing software to observe wireless networks. Doing so reveals what is seen as worthy of observation (e.g., what protocols, what space, which devices), the granularity of the observation (e.g., how is the observation captured, in what detail), the logo and conceptual framework of choice etc. \n*Where/when/situation?: Ideally, SWOA can be used everywhere. In reality, institutions, laws and administrators like to control the use of SWOA on infrastructures not also run by the people running it. Hence, we get distinctions like researchers and pen testers (e.g., they were hired) vs. hackers. \n*What: Deep philosophical moment: most software has a recursive observatory ambition (it wants to be observed in its execution, output etc.). Debuggers, logs, dashboards are all instances of software with observatory ambitions and can not be separated from software itself. So, what separates SWOA from software itself? HELP! \n*Who/with: If you can run the SWOA (many of these are promises more than running software/available code), you can do it. The question is: will people like it if you observe their SWOA?\n*Why/urgency/ [this is maybe related to the engagement question?]: If critical engagement in software is a thing, it follows that people would develop software to observe. \n*Note: [anything that did not fit above.]\n*WARNING: \n*REMEMBER: Good SWOA software usually uses an animal as a logo.:D\n*See also: making a bestiary of visual cultures/logos around it\n\n*Method: Rearranging space as conditioning observations (WTC vs. Museum vs. University vs. Startup Office vs. Shifting Walls that became Water Fountains)\n*By: [who developed, tested, proposed this method]\n*How: [ideas for how the observation method can be applied]\n*Where/when: [in what situation, space, circumstances does the observation take place]\n*What: [what/who gets observed.

Some of the play would come in from the mix of recognizable and common methods (visit a museum (ie. Namur and Leuven), conduct interviews (ie. with Jean Heuns but also as Relational software observatory consultancy service), organize and hold a worksession (ie. what we did), listen to an expert (ie.

What software category does it apply to agile/SaaS?]\n*Who: [who/what gets to observe]\n*Why: [what is the engagement, of the observer with the observed and vice versa]\n*Note: [anything that did not fit above.]\n\n*Method: Testing the testbed: testing software with observatory ambitions (SWOA)\n*By/history/source/origin/process: the \"original testbed\" was proposed by researchers/collaborators in Princeton. Testing this testbed at a local Constant workshop led to the meta-project of testing software meant for testing software. \n*How: The interwebs hosts many projects that aim to produce software for observing software, (from now on Software With Observatory Ambitions (SWOA)). A comparative methodology can be produced by using different SWOA to observe software of interest. Example: use different sniffing software to observe wireless networks. Doing so reveals what is seen as worthy of observation (e.g., what protocols, what space, which devices), the granularity of the observation (e.g., how is the observation captured, in what detail), the logo and conceptual framework of choice etc. \n*Where/when/situation?: Ideally, SWOA can be used everywhere. In reality, institutions, laws and administrators like to control the use of SWOA on infrastructures not also run by the people running it. Hence, we get distinctions like researchers and pen testers (e.g., they were hired) vs. hackers. \n*What: Deep philosophical moment: most software has a recursive observatory ambition (it wants to be observed in its execution, output etc.). Debuggers, logs, dashboards are all instances of software with observatory ambitions and can not be separated from software itself. So, what separates SWOA from software itself? HELP! \n*Who/with: If you can run the SWOA (many of these are promises more than running software/available code), you can do it. The question is: will people like it if you observe their SWOA?\n*Why/urgency/ [this is maybe related to the engagement question?]: If critical engagement in software is a thing, it follows that people would develop software to observe. \n*Note: [anything that did not fit above.]\n*WARNING: \n*REMEMBER: Good SWOA software usually uses an animal as a logo.:D\n*See also: making a bestiary of visual cultures/logos around it\n\n*Method: Rearranging space as conditioning observations (WTC vs. Museum vs. University vs. Startup Office vs. Shifting Walls that became Water Fountains)\n*By: [who developed, tested, proposed this method]\n*How: [ideas for how the observation method can be applied]\n*Where/when: [in what situation, space, circumstances does the observation take place]\n*What: [what/who gets observed.

One way to handle the publication/documentation tension would be to structure a publication around a set of ways of knowing/methods and then select and shape documentation from the worksession as samples of these methods or taking moments from the workshop as prompts for reflection on these methods. Some of the play would come in from the mix of recognizable and common methods (visit a museum (ie. Namur and Leuven), conduct interviews (ie. with Jean Heuns but also as Relational software observatory consultancy service), organize and hold a worksession (ie. what we did), listen to an expert (ie. sidechannel)) with the less common ones (ie. create a bestiary of software logos, engaging with code through collective reading/performance, etc). \n\n\n\n\nChapters/sections\n\n-possible groupings..\n\nFLOWS\nflow-regulation, logistics, seamlessness\ncontinuous integration\nfountains (refreshment)\netherpad->md->pdf->anything pipeline\nflowcharts excercise (Flow of the chart - chart of the flow on demand!)\nembodied flowchart-elevator\n\ntemporality\nflux\ntime-piece \ntempo of agile software/SaaS\n\nresistance\nuseless scroll against productivity\nInterface Détournement\n\nlanguaging\naquine \nglossary-excercise?\nqualifiers (secure, bad, bourgeois, queer..)\n\nhealing\nrelational software observatory consultancy service\nretrospection\nAgile Sun Salutation\nhand reading\nwhen dirty.db gets dirty\n\nclose encounters\nvisiting a museum\ninterviews\nasking the same question\ngetting down in your computer functioning (files/processes/ram)\nrelational software observatory consultancy service\nwith your future?blobservation\n\nembodiment/body techniques\nAgile Sun Salutation: see Healing\nCOLLECTIVE CHAIR YOGA!!!\nfountain \ncomportment of software (occupational hazards)\n\ncollections\nbestiary of software logos (we collect)\ncomputer history museum (institutional collection)\njean heuns collection at leuven (personal/institutional)\nTesting the testbed: testing software with observatory ambitions\n\n\nbeingontheside/inthemiddle/behind\nsomethinginthemiddlemaybe\nelevator\nside channel attacks\n\nMethods for inadequate observation of software [inadequate methods?]\n\nbut then the things in these groupings can be arranged/divided by form? like descrptive entries/ exercises/ diagrams/ conversation with/ gloss/\n\nWARNINGS\n[[warning: \"our methods for observation, like mapping, come with their luggage.\" from Thursday afternoon section of http://observatory.constantvzw.org/etherdump/toc.md.diff.html ]]\n[[warning: some of these methods are not suitable for agile software/SaaS observation]]\n\n","attribs":"|4+4q*0*1+h*0|4+1s*0+1f*2|1+1*0|7+7x*2+s*0|d+ct|5+1g+1h*0+9|1+1+1w*0+5|1+1+1a*0+d|2+3t+2p*0+6|dv+io6"}}},"pad:observatory.methods:revs:3000":{"changeset":"Z:ob3>2|2p=3kr=1*0+2$ub","meta":{"author":"a.ocPhP3HyN6Ppfg6m","timestamp":1515529126250,"atext":{"text":"http://pad.constantvzw.org/p/observatory.afterlives\nhttp://pad.constantvzw.org/p/observatory.inventory\nhttp://pad.constantvzw.org/p/observatory.guide --> 1-2 December\n\n9 JANUARY MEETING\n\nAgenda for tonight meeting: \nTHE INTERNATIONAL MEETING\n- See what still needs to be done\n- Send out e-mail to TGSO list: deadline 29 January\n\nMeet here at 20h CET https://meet.jit.si/observatory\n\nEditing\nCarlin has been reading, working on some items.

(now under the essentials)\nShe Does Not Feel Lost.\nWhat scale of conversation? Intro could do with some tweaking, but in general works.\nRead through half of the methods. Feels familiar. Need to hand it to interested people that were not at the workshop.\nSend this to people that were at TGSO first.\nLikes the mix: Conversational and some more 'technical'.\n\nSeda also had a look -- some things to add and remove ... introduction (stops with freelancer-utopia, but what about turkers, clickworkers, on-line task workers ...)\nMight need something on services in the clinic description. Some humor!\nIn general: we could be funnier and more surreal! Funny + sharp.

In the mean time, Anita, Martino, Carlin, Peggy, Seda, Michael, Femke have been joined by Christoph to work on The Guide To Technogalactic Software Observation.\n\nWe have been trying to put together a collection that is both documenting the session, and making a publication. As part of this we have created a list of methods for software observation that are drawn from the worksession documentation. We chose to show the materials in terms of methods for observation, hoping this loose frame can welcome irony and bending.\nWhile we are trying to reach some density and coherence, the guide does not aim for completeness. Rather we hope to give an impression of the variety of tones and materials that were manifested during our 6 days together.\nNow that there is some basic structure for the guide, we would like to invite you, our fellow observers, to add materials and/or add methods you feel are missing. \n\nYou can find the index here with links to all contributions http://pad.constantvzw.org/p/observatory.guide (there is some markup added for generating the guide directly from pads, obviously). You are welcome to update/complete/correct existing items or to add new ones.\n\nSome examples of more or less 'complete' methods that you can copy from: https://pad.constantvzw.org/p/observatory.guide.agile.yoga , https://pad.constantvzw.org/p/observatory.guide.somethinginthemiddlemaybe , https://pad.constantvzw.org/p/observatory.guide.visit , https://pad.constantvzw.org/p/observatory.guide.monopsychism\n\nIf you would like to make use of our notes from the worksession, you can find the pages indexed here: http://observatory.constantvzw.org/etherdump/_new_index.html\nWe have only a short window of time to put this together so that we can meet the publication deadline. The deadline for your contributions is January 29\n\nIf you want to contribute, can you send an e-mail to the mailinglist [EMAIL HERE] so we can all coordinate.\n\n----\nSEND EMAIL BEFORE THE WEEKEND WITH MESSY PDF\n\n\nAnita as Madonna\nhttps://pad.constantvzw.org/p/observatory.guide.colophon\n\n\n\nLAST ROUNDS 2 DECEMBER\n\nPlanning\n\nBefore January 9:\n- Finish descriptions of clusters (Martino? + Femke?)

Testing this testbed at a local Constant workshop led to the meta-project of testing software meant for testing software. \n*How: The interwebs hosts many projects that aim to produce software for observing software, (from now on Software With Observatory Ambitions (SWOA)). A comparative methodology can be produced by using different SWOA to observe software of interest. Example: use different sniffing software to observe wireless networks. Doing so reveals what is seen as worthy of observation (e.g., what protocols, what space, which devices), the granularity of the observation (e.g., how is the observation captured, in what detail), the logo and conceptual framework of choice etc. \n*Where/when/situation?: Ideally, SWOA can be used everywhere. In reality, institutions, laws and administrators like to control the use of SWOA on infrastructures not also run by the people running it. Hence, we get distinctions like researchers and pen testers (e.g., they were hired) vs. hackers. \n*What: Deep philosophical moment: most software has a recursive observatory ambition (it wants to be observed in its execution, output etc.). Debuggers, logs, dashboards are all instances of software with observatory ambitions and can not be separated from software itself. So, what separates SWOA from software itself? HELP! \n*Who/with: If you can run the SWOA (many of these are promises more than running software/available code), you can do it. The question is: will people like it if you observe their SWOA?\n*Why/urgency/ [this is maybe related to the engagement question?]: If critical engagement in software is a thing, it follows that people would develop software to observe. \n*Note: [anything that did not fit above.]\n*WARNING: \n*REMEMBER: Good SWOA software usually uses an animal as a logo.:D\n*See also: making a bestiary of visual cultures/logos around it\n\n*Method: Rearranging space as conditioning observations (WTC vs. Museum vs. University vs. Startup Office vs. Shifting Walls that became Water Fountains)\n*By: [who developed, tested, proposed this method]\n*How: [ideas for how the observation method can be applied]\n*Where/when: [in what situation, space, circumstances does the observation take place]\n*What: [what/who gets observed.

One way to handle the publication/documentation tension would be to structure a publication around a set of ways of knowing/methods and then select and shape documentation from the worksession as samples of these methods or taking moments from the workshop as prompts for reflection on these methods. Some of the play would come in from the mix of recognizable and common methods (visit a museum (ie. Namur and Leuven), conduct interviews (ie. with Jean Heuns but also as Relational software observatory consultancy service), organize and hold a worksession (ie. what we did), listen to an expert (ie. sidechannel)) with the less common ones (ie. create a bestiary of software logos, engaging with code through collective reading/performance, etc). \n\n\n\n\nChapters/sections\n\n-possible

Testing this testbed at a local Constant workshop led to the meta-project of testing software meant for testing software. \n*How: The interwebs hosts many projects that aim to produce software for observing software, (from now on Software With Observatory Ambitions (SWOA)). A comparative methodology can be produced by using different SWOA to observe software of interest. Example: use different sniffing software to observe wireless networks. Doing so reveals what is seen as worthy of observation (e.g., what protocols, what space, which devices), the granularity of the observation (e.g., how is the observation captured, in what detail), the logo and conceptual framework of choice etc. \n*Where/when/situation?: Ideally, SWOA can be used everywhere. In reality, institutions, laws and administrators like to control the use of SWOA on infrastructures not also run by the people running it. Hence, we get distinctions like researchers and pen testers (e.g., they were hired) vs. hackers. \n*What: Deep philosophical moment: most software has a recursive observatory ambition (it wants to be observed in its execution, output etc.). Debuggers, logs, dashboards are all instances of software with observatory ambitions and can not be separated from software itself. So, what separates SWOA from software itself? HELP! \n*Who/with: If you can run the SWOA (many of these are promises more than running software/available code), you can do it. The question is: will people like it if you observe their SWOA?\n*Why/urgency/ [this is maybe related to the engagement question?]: If critical engagement in software is a thing, it follows that people would develop software to observe. \n","meta":{"author":"","timestamp":1513950495574}},"pad:observatory.methods:revs:310":{"changeset":"Z:jw7>2|g=gc=10*2+2$l ","meta":{"author":"a.EXnmpSWanmHBGv1u","timestamp":1515525279265}},"pad:observatory.methods:revs:3100":{"changeset":"Z:of5<2|2w=439=an-2$","meta":{"author":"a.jzuxQRlQ52uJVG5R","timestamp":1515529204997,"atext":{"text":"http://pad.constantvzw.org/p/observatory.afterlives\nhttp://pad.constantvzw.org/p/observatory.inventory\nhttp://pad.constantvzw.org/p/observatory.guide --> 1-2 December\n\n9 JANUARY MEETING\n\nAgenda for tonight meeting: \nTHE INTERNATIONAL MEETING\n- See what still needs to be done\n- Send out e-mail to TGSO list: deadline 29 January\n\nMeet here at 20h CET https://meet.jit.si/observatory\n\nEditing\nCarlin has been reading, working on some items.

In the mean time, Anita, Martino, Carlin, Peggy, Seda, Michael, Femke have been joined by Christoph to work on The Guide To Technogalactic Software Observation.\n\nWe have been trying to put together a collection that is both documenting the session, and making a publication. As part of this we have created a list of methods for software observation that are drawn from the worksession documentation. We chose to show the materials in terms of methods for observation, hoping this loose frame can welcome irony and bending.\nWhile we are trying to reach some density and coherence, the guide does not aim for completeness. Rather we hope to give an impression of the variety of tones and materials that were manifested during our 6 days together. Now that there is some basic structure for the guide, we would like to invite you, our fellow observers, to add materials and/or add methods you feel must be in  guide to technogalactic software observation!\n\nYou can find the index here with links to all contributions http://pad.constantvzw.org/p/observatory.guide (there is some markup added for generating the guide directly from pads, obviously). You are welcome to update/complete/correct existing items or to add new ones.\n\nSome examples of more or less 'complete' methods that you can copy from: https://pad.constantvzw.org/p/observatory.guide.agile.yoga , https://pad.constantvzw.org/p/observatory.guide.somethinginthemiddlemaybe , https://pad.constantvzw.org/p/observatory.guide.visit , https://pad.constantvzw.org/p/observatory.guide.monopsychism\n\nIf you would like to make use of our notes from the worksession, you can find the pages indexed here: http://observatory.constantvzw.org/etherdump/_new_index.html\nWe have only a short window of time to put this together so that we can meet the publication deadline. The deadline for your contributions is January 29\n\nIf you want to contribute, or have questions, please send an e-mail to the mailinglist [observatory@lists.constantvzw.org] so we can all coordinate.\n\n\n\n----\nSEND EMAIL BEFORE THE WEEKEND WITH MESSY PDF\n\n\nAnita as Madonna\nhttps://pad.constantvzw.org/p/observatory.guide.colophon\n\n\n\nLAST ROUNDS 2 DECEMBER\n\nPlanning\n\nBefore January 9:\n- Finish descriptions of clusters (Martino? + Femke?) NOT DONE\n- Finish introduction (Done for now? Maybe another round on Feb. 9?) DONE\n- Interview Jean Huens + transcription (Peggy) interview DONE, transcription next week Wed\n- Establish a level of editing that shows a balance between documentation and guidance (all of us try to finish the entries we took on)\n- Finish pdf to a point that no content is missing and we can start discussing design (Christoph) DONE!\n\nMeet January 9, 20h CET (1.5 hr meeting max)\n- See what still needs to be done\n- Send out e-mail to TGSO list: deadline 29 January\n\n[Carlin starts editing]\n\n9 February 12h CET: we meet to finish whatever needs to be done \nCarlin joins at 16h CET\n\nEnd February: print\nMain pads:\nhttp://pad.constantvzw.org/p/observatory.methods\nhttp://pad.constantvzw.org/p/observatory.guide\n\n---\n\nCarlin's questions\n- editing process\n*- different approach for primary materials (taken from workshop) vs framing materials created now\n*- in order to respect the documentation of the primary material (michael)\n*- how can this be a document that oscillates between \"look what cool methods we used and \"here are some things you could try out yourself\"\n\"If you are writing, you have liberties\" - if necessary, ask people who were involved in the thing to \n- order of entries\nhttp://pad.constantvzw.org/p/observatory.guide\n- incorporation of photographs, diagrams, etc\nYES!\n- small note (visit computer collections appears twice in the current html)\n(probably ok now?)\n\nlook for phrases / ways for introducing the chapters/groupings. Could be just a line? A task for someone?\nTest: http://pad.constantvzw.org/p/observatory.guide.grouping.temporality\n\nIntroduction http://pad.constantvzw.org/p/observatory.guide.introduction Peggy + FS + Seda first round\n\nAdd reference to the walk-in clinic? A description. Unlike normal guides: we have not removed the process. WARNING: there will be a mix of abstractions and concrete experiences.\n\nCarlin works on 3 entries\n\nThe interview needs to be done -> Peggy\n\nHans e-mail -> Martino\nAna + Ricardo -> Femke\n\nFor each of the chapter descriptions: quote from the materials/reader? Could be an image. Or a short inspirational phrase? -> Martino tries\nhttp://pad.constantvzw.org/p/observatory.guide\n\nAn email to other TGSO participants, call for help/see if further material is available (once the PDF is more stable)\n\nWARNING: pad fatigue might occur\n\nlatex todo:\n* be able to force empty new lines  (f.ex to put back lines in scrollresistance)\n* differentiate code quotes from pad quotes\n\n\n\n\n\nSAS Survival Handbook: The Ultimate Guide to Surviving Anywhere \nhttps://archive.org/stream/SASSurvivalHandbookTheUltimateGuideToSurvivingAnywhere/AppNee.com.SAS.Survival.Handbook.2nd.Edition#page/n359/mode/2up\nThe  Rudiments Of Wisdom encyclopaedia by Tim Hunkin.\nhttp://www.rudimentsofwisdom.com\n\nissue: different materials. works well to situate the week. fr an interview, a good way to introduce. but with folders, code ... so brought the SAS guide.

YES but WHAT IS SOFTWARE\n\nsing through and to the hardware and software\n\nwhat is the 'entrypoint'(element from inventory?)-method relation\nmethods as a way to label and address things, still keeping open to other materials to enter (ie interview..)\n\nEverything in the guide is a METHOD, but how do we group and groom the methods???\n\nDo we do a publication, an event .. the fact that we have been through an event, and even that we describe it, means we are developing the methods.<- is this like observation transforms the method!?\nSo: is this documentation, or will we open it to new input. Ongoing.\n\nDifference between documentation and publication\n\nExampe: e-mail of jogi. \nThat report is already published and structured?

What software category does it apply to agile/SaaS?]\n*Who: [who/what gets to observe]\n*Why: [what is the engagement, of the observer with the observed and vice versa]\n*Note: [anything that did not fit above.]\n\n*Method: Testing the testbed: testing software with observatory ambitions (SWOA)\n*By/history/source/origin/process: the \"original testbed\" was proposed by researchers/collaborators in Princeton. Testing this testbed at a local Constant workshop led to the meta-project of testing software meant for testing software. \n*How: The interwebs hosts many projects that aim to produce software for observing software, (from now on Software With Observatory Ambitions (SWOA)). A comparative methodology can be produced by using different SWOA to observe software of interest. Example: use different sniffing software to observe wireless networks. Doing so reveals what is seen as worthy of observation (e.g., what protocols, what space, which devices), the granularity of the observation (e.g., how is the observation captured, in what detail), the logo and conceptual framework of choice etc. \n*Where/when/situation?: Ideally, SWOA can be used everywhere. In reality, institutions, laws and administrators like to control the use of SWOA on infrastructures not also run by the people running it. Hence, we get distinctions like researchers and pen testers (e.g., they were hired) vs. hackers. \n*What: Deep philosophical moment: most software has a recursive observatory ambition (it wants to be observed in its execution, output etc.). Debuggers, logs, dashboards are all instances of software with observatory ambitions and can not be separated from software itself. So, what separates SWOA from software itself? HELP! \n*Who/with: If you can run the SWOA (many of these are promises more than running software/available code), you can do it. The question is: will people like it if you observe their SWOA?\n*Why/urgency/ [this is maybe related to the engagement question?]: If critical engagement in software is a thing, it follows that people would develop software to observe. \n*Note: [anything that did not fit above.]\n*WARNING: \n*REMEMBER: Good SWOA software usually uses an animal as a logo.:D\n*See also: making a bestiary of visual cultures/logos around it\n\n*Method: Rearranging space as conditioning observations (WTC vs. Museum vs. University vs. Startup Office vs. Shifting Walls that became Water Fountains)\n*By: [who developed, tested, proposed this method]\n*How: [ideas for how the observation method can be applied]\n*Where/when: [in what situation, space, circumstances does the observation take place]\n*What: [what/who gets observed.

Some of the play would come in from the mix of recognizable and common methods (visit a museum (ie. Namur and Leuven), conduct interviews (ie. with Jean Heuns but also as Relational software observatory consultancy service), organize and hold a worksession (ie. what we did), listen to an expert (ie.

Editing glossary.\nQuestion: what about this warning:\nhttp://pad.constantvzw.org/p/observatory.guide.warning -- it is a meta-warning that should go first? (now under the essentials)\nShe Does Not Feel Lost.\nWhat scale of conversation? Intro could do with some tweaking, but in general works.\nRead through half of the methods. Feels familiar. Need to hand it to interested people that were not at the workshop.\nSend this to people that were at TGSO first.\nLikes the mix: Conversational and some more 'technical'.\n\nSeda also had a look -- some things to add and remove ... introduction (stops with freelancer-utopia, but what about turkers, clickworkers, on-line task workers ...)\nMight need something on services in the clinic description. Some humor!\nIn general: we could be funnier and more surreal! Funny + sharp. Could use some edge. \"We cannot be funny with software right now\"\nDatabases of populations (El Salvadoreans about to be deported, India's biometric database being sold to journalists etc)\nEmergency ... games of words. Needs some push.\nContinuous integration missing from html?\n\nhttps://pad.constantvzw.org/p/observatory.guide.introduction\nTension in the introduction. First: critical distance, then entanglement. Need to name it/connect it. Helps to tie in the quote?\nLater: \"going beyond\" ... MMo -- need to reformulate. Make quote (why it is there) more xplicit.\nDistance can be critical but not always. \n\n\nWork a bit more on the introduction, this can work on its own?\nSo the text should be a text to be read that stands on its own and does work on its own. \nMaybe the introduction needs to be more explicitly political.\n\nSeda looked for methods -- there are some missing. Christoph will make them appear!\nAlso: if we open to others, they will bring new energy.\nCalendar App Collapsing!\nPeggy: we can do this on the 9th? Or maybe not. \nSeda: separate time for sharpening the introduction, to keep serioussnes and humor together.\n\nCluster descriptions not done yet/not in the html. Should we write them or use quotes?\nSome Humor Can Go Here.\nNeeds writing -- we tried using quotes only, but it does not work for all.\n\nhttp://pad.constantvzw.org/p/observatory.guide.grouping.temporality\nhttp://pad.constantvzw.org/p/observatory.guide.grouping.languaging\nillustrations to open the groupings\nWorks well with the design! So, make mixes of images/quotes and some writing.\nCarlin: it does not need to be a lot ... one or two words. Titles already do a lot.\n\nAppendix\nPeggy has done the interview and will do the transciption by next week\nMeeting was very nice! New stories added. Anecdotes.\n(CH: what about the interview, where/how to put it?)\nLet's just put it into the https://pad.constantvzw.org/p/observatory.guide.jean.heuns pad\ndon't mind the formatting right now.\nAn hour of conversation.

In the mean time, Anita, Martino, Carlin, Peggy, Seda, Michael, Femke have been joined by Christoph to work on The Guide To Techno-Galactic Software Observation.\n\nWe have been trying to put together a collection that works both as a documentation of the session and as a /new/ publication. As part of this we have created a list of methods for software observation that are drawn from the worksession documentation. We chose to show the materials in terms of methods for observation, hoping this loose frame can welcome irony and bending.\nWhile we are trying to reach some density and coherence, the guide does not aim for completeness. Rather we hope to give an impression of the variety of tones and materials that were manifested during our 6 days together. Now that there is some basic structure for the guide, we would like to invite you, our fellow observers, to add materials and/or add methods you feel must be in THE guide to techno-galactic software observation!\n\nTYou can find the index here with links to all contributions http://pad.constantvzw.org/p/observatory.guide (there is some markup added for generating the guide directly from pads, obviously). You are welcome to update/complete/correct existing items or to add new ones.\n\nSome examples of more or less 'complete' methods that you can copy from: https://pad.constantvzw.org/p/observatory.guide.agile.yoga , https://pad.constantvzw.org/p/observatory.guide.somethinginthemiddlemaybe , https://pad.constantvzw.org/p/observatory.guide.visit , https://pad.constantvzw.org/p/observatory.guide.monopsychism\nStyle guide below!\n\nIf you would like to make use of the notes from the worksession, you can find the pages indexed here: http://observatory.constantvzw.org/etherdump/_new_index.html\nWe have only a short window of time to put this together so that we can meet the publication deadline. The deadline for your contributions is January 29\n\nIf you want to commit to a contribution, or have questions, or comments, please send an e-mail to the mailinglist [observatory@lists.constantvzw.org] in the coming days so we can all coordinate.\n\n\n\n\n----\nSEND EMAIL BEFORE THE WEEKEND WITH MESSY PDF\n\n\nAnita as Madonna\nhttps://pad.constantvzw.org/p/observatory.guide.colophon\n\n\n\nLAST ROUNDS 2 DECEMBER\n\nPlanning\n\nBefore January 9:\n- Finish descriptions of clusters (Martino? + Femke?)

Testing this testbed at a local Constant workshop led to the meta-project of testing software meant for testing software. \n*How: The interwebs hosts many projects that aim to produce software for observing software, (from now on Software With Observatory Ambitions (SWOA)). A comparative methodology can be produced by using different SWOA to observe software of interest. Example: use different sniffing software to observe wireless networks. Doing so reveals what is seen as worthy of observation (e.g., what protocols, what space, which devices), the granularity of the observation (e.g., how is the observation captured, in what detail), the logo and conceptual framework of choice etc. \n*Where/when/situation?: Ideally, SWOA can be used everywhere. In reality, institutions, laws and administrators like to control the use of SWOA on infrastructures not also run by the people running it. Hence, we get distinctions like researchers and pen testers (e.g., they were hired) vs. hackers. \n*What: Deep philosophical moment: most software has a recursive observatory ambition (it wants to be observed in its execution, output etc.). Debuggers, logs, dashboards are all instances of software with observatory ambitions and can not be separated from software itself. So, what separates SWOA from software itself? HELP! \n*Who/with: If you can run the SWOA (many of these are promises more than running software/available code), you can do it. The question is: will people like it if you observe their SWOA?\n*Why/urgency/ [this is maybe related to the engagement question?]: If critical engagement in software is a thing, it follows that people would develop software to observe. \n*Note: [anything that did not fit above.]\n*WARNING: \n*REMEMBER: Good SWOA software usually uses an animal as a logo.:D\n*See also: making a bestiary of visual cultures/logos around it\n\n*Method: Rearranging space as conditioning observations (WTC vs. Museum vs. University vs. Startup Office vs. Shifting Walls that became Water Fountains)\n*By: [who developed, tested, proposed this method]\n*How: [ideas for how the observation method can be applied]\n*Where/when: [in what situation, space, circumstances does the observation take place]\n*What: [what/who gets observed.

(now under the essentials)\nShe Does Not Feel Lost.\nWhat scale of conversation? Intro could do with some tweaking, but in general works.\nRead through half of the methods. Feels familiar.

In the mean time, Anita, Martino, Carlin, Peggy, Seda, Michael, Femke have been joined by Christoph to work on The Guide To Techno-Galactic Software Observation.\n\nWe have been trying to put together a collection that works both as a documentation of the session and as a /new/ publication. As part of this we have created a list of methods for software observation that are drawn from the worksession documentation. We chose to show the materials in terms of methods for observation, hoping this loose frame can welcome irony and bending.\nWhile we are trying to reach some density and coherence, the guide does not aim for completeness. Rather we hope to give an impression of the variety of tones and materials that were manifested during our 6 days together. Now that there is some basic structure for the guide, we would like to invite you, our fellow observers, to add materials and/or add methods you feel must be in THE guide to techno-galactic software observation!\n\nHere is a first pdf: xxxxx [LINK HERE]. \nYou can find the live index to all methods so far: \n    http://pad.constantvzw.org/p/observatory.guide \n    (there is some markup added for generating the guide directly from pads, obviously). \nYou are welcome to update/complete/correct existing items or to add new ones.\n\nSome examples of more or less 'complete' methods that you can copy from: \n    https://pad.constantvzw.org/p/observatory.guide.agile.yoga , \n    https://pad.constantvzw.org/p/observatory.guide.somethinginthemiddlemaybe , \n    https://pad.constantvzw.org/p/observatory.guide.visit , \n    https://pad.constantvzw.org/p/observatory.guide.monopsychism\n\nStyle guide below!\n\nIf you would like to make use of the notes from the worksession, you can find the pages indexed here: \n    http://observatory.constantvzw.org/etherdump/_new_index.html\n\nWe have only a short window of time to put this together so that we can meet the publication deadline. The deadline for your contributions is January 29\n\nIf you want to commit to a contribution, or have questions, or comments, please send an e-mail to the mailinglist [observatory@lists.constantvzw.org] in the coming days so we can all coordinate.\n\n\n\n\n----\nSEND EMAIL BEFORE THE WEEKEND WITH MESSY PDF\n\nCarlin + Seda see if they can do something for the intro (Femke maybe \nAnita sends editors a\n\n\nAnita as Madonna\nhttps://pad.constantvzw.org/p/observatory.guide.colophon\n\n\n\nLAST ROUNDS 2 DECEMBER\n\nPlanning\n\nBefore January 9:\n- Finish descriptions of clusters (Martino? + Femke?) NOT DONE\n- Finish introduction (Done for now? Maybe another round on Feb. 9?) DONE\n- Interview Jean Huens + transcription (Peggy) interview DONE, transcription next week Wed\n- Establish a level of editing that shows a balance between documentation and guidance (all of us try to finish the entries we took on)\n- Finish pdf to a point that no content is missing and we can start discussing design (Christoph) DONE!\n\nMeet January 9, 20h CET (1.5 hr meeting max)\n- See what still needs to be done\n- Send out e-mail to TGSO list: deadline 29 January\n\n[Carlin starts editing]\n\n9 February 12h CET: we meet to finish whatever needs to be done \nCarlin joins at 16h CET\n\nEnd February: print\nMain pads:\nhttp://pad.constantvzw.org/p/observatory.methods\nhttp://pad.constantvzw.org/p/observatory.guide\n\n---\n\nCarlin's questions\n- editing process\n*- different approach for primary materials (taken from workshop) vs framing materials created now\n*- in order to respect the documentation of the primary material (michael)\n*- how can this be a document that oscillates between \"look what cool methods we used and \"here are some things you could try out yourself\"\n\"If you are writing, you have liberties\" - if necessary, ask people who were involved in the thing to \n- order of entries\nhttp://pad.constantvzw.org/p/observatory.guide\n- incorporation of photographs, diagrams, etc\nYES!\n- small note (visit computer collections appears twice in the current html)\n(probably ok now?)\n\nlook for phrases / ways for introducing the chapters/groupings. Could be just a line? A task for someone?\nTest: http://pad.constantvzw.org/p/observatory.guide.grouping.temporality\n\nIntroduction http://pad.constantvzw.org/p/observatory.guide.introduction Peggy + FS + Seda first round\n\nAdd reference to the walk-in clinic? A description. Unlike normal guides: we have not removed the process. WARNING: there will be a mix of abstractions and concrete experiences.\n\nCarlin works on 3 entries\n\nThe interview needs to be done -> Peggy\n\nHans e-mail -> Martino\nAna + Ricardo -> Femke\n\nFor each of the chapter descriptions: quote from the materials/reader? Could be an image. Or a short inspirational phrase? -> Martino tries\nhttp://pad.constantvzw.org/p/observatory.guide\n\nAn email to other TGSO participants, call for help/see if further material is available (once the PDF is more stable)\n\nWARNING: pad fatigue might occur\n\nlatex todo:\n* be able to force empty new lines  (f.ex to put back lines in scrollresistance)\n* differentiate code quotes from pad quotes\n\n\n\n\n\nSAS Survival Handbook: The Ultimate Guide to Surviving Anywhere \nhttps://archive.org/stream/SASSurvivalHandbookTheUltimateGuideToSurvivingAnywhere/AppNee.com.SAS.Survival.Handbook.2nd.Edition#page/n359/mode/2up\nThe  Rudiments Of Wisdom encyclopaedia by Tim Hunkin.\nhttp://www.rudimentsofwisdom.com\n\nissue: different materials. works well to situate the week. fr an interview, a good way to introduce. but with folders, code ... so brought the SAS guide.

Do we want it to be of use? The difference between documentation and publication is the imagined audience\ndocumentation: audience is the participants, does not have the ambition to be legible to non-participants\npublication: a broader audience (with contributions from other participants but not from those who did not participate in the work session) who would be able to pick it up and understand the techno-galactic condition\n\n\nCan we decide on a few kinds of formats and test them\n- one can be a breakdown like on the methods list\n- one can be more just description/summary/exericse\n\nwe look at the methods\nand other forms of documentation\nsee if the proposed structure works\nspecifically:\n*test: make a round of groupings / hierarchies affinities\n*test: make more methods\n*test: other templates\n*\n7:20 CET back to discuss\n\nPeggy:\n\nFor the interview ... something that could be easily done, short bio interview with 2-3 q to the participants.

What software category does it apply to agile/SaaS?]\n*Who: [who/what gets to observe]\n*Why: [what is the engagement, of the observer with the observed and vice versa]\n*Note: [anything that did not fit above.]\n\n*Method: Testing the testbed: testing software with observatory ambitions (SWOA)\n*By/history/source/origin/process: the \"original testbed\" was proposed by researchers/collaborators in Princeton. Testing this testbed at a local Constant workshop led to the meta-project of testing software meant for testing software. \n*How: The interwebs hosts many projects that aim to produce software for observing software, (from now on Software With Observatory Ambitions (SWOA)). A comparative methodology can be produced by using different SWOA to observe software of interest. Example: use different sniffing software to observe wireless networks. Doing so reveals what is seen as worthy of observation (e.g., what protocols, what space, which devices), the granularity of the observation (e.g., how is the observation captured, in what detail), the logo and conceptual framework of choice etc. \n*Where/when/situation?: Ideally, SWOA can be used everywhere. In reality, institutions, laws and administrators like to control the use of SWOA on infrastructures not also run by the people running it. Hence, we get distinctions like researchers and pen testers (e.g., they were hired) vs. hackers. \n*What: Deep philosophical moment: most software has a recursive observatory ambition (it wants to be observed in its execution, output etc.). Debuggers, logs, dashboards are all instances of software with observatory ambitions and can not be separated from software itself. So, what separates SWOA from software itself? HELP! \n*Who/with: If you can run the SWOA (many of these are promises more than running software/available code), you can do it. The question is: will people like it if you observe their SWOA?\n*Why/urgency/ [this is maybe related to the engagement question?]: If critical engagement in software is a thing, it follows that people would develop software to observe. \n*Note: [anything that did not fit above.]\n*WARNING: \n*REMEMBER: Good SWOA software usually uses an animal as a logo.:D\n*See also: making a bestiary of visual cultures/logos around it\n\n*Method: Rearranging space as conditioning observations (WTC vs. Museum vs. University vs. Startup Office vs. Shifting Walls that became Water Fountains)\n*By: [who developed, tested, proposed this method]\n*How: [ideas for how the observation method can be applied]\n*Where/when: [in what situation, space, circumstances does the observation take place]\n*What: [what/who gets observed.

One way to handle the publication/documentation tension would be to structure a publication around a set of ways of knowing/methods and then select and shape documentation from the worksession as samples of these methods or taking moments from the workshop as prompts for reflection on these methods. Some of the play would come in from the mix of recognizable and common methods (visit a museum (ie. Namur and Leuven), conduct interviews (ie. with Jean Heuns but also as Relational software observatory consultancy service), organize and hold a worksession (ie. what we did), listen to an expert (ie. sidechannel)) with the less common ones (ie. create a bestiary of software logos, engaging with code through collective reading/performance, etc). \n\n\n\n\nChapters/sections\n\n-possible

In the mean time, Anita, Martino, Carlin, Peggy, Seda, Michael, Femke have been joined by Christoph to work on The Guide To Techno-Galactic Software Observation.\n\nWe have been trying to put together a collection that works both as a documentation of the session and as a /new/ publication. As part of this we have created a list of methods for software observation that are drawn from the worksession documentation. We chose to show the materials in terms of methods for observation, hoping this loose frame can welcome irony and bending.\nWhile we are trying to reach some density and coherence, the guide does not aim for completeness. Rather we hope to give an impression of the variety of tones and materials that were manifested during our 6 days together. Now that there is some basic structure for the guide, we would like to invite you, our fellow observers, to add materials and/or add methods you feel must be in THE guide to techno-galactic software observation!\n\nHere is a first pdf: xxxxx [LINK HERE]. \nYou can find the live index to all methods so far: \n    http://pad.constantvzw.org/p/observatory.guide \n    (there is some markup added for generating the guide directly from pads, obviously). \nYou are welcome to update/complete/correct existing items or to add new ones.\n\nSome examples of more or less 'complete' methods that you can copy from: \n    https://pad.constantvzw.org/p/observatory.guide.agile.yoga , \n    https://pad.constantvzw.org/p/observatory.guide.somethinginthemiddlemaybe , \n    https://pad.constantvzw.org/p/observatory.guide.visit , \n    https://pad.constantvzw.org/p/observatory.guide.monopsychism\n\nStyle guide below!\n\nIf you would like to make use of the notes from the worksession, you can find the pages indexed here: \n    http://observatory.constantvzw.org/etherdump/_new_index.html\n\nWe have only a short window of time to put this together so that we can meet the publication deadline. The deadline for your contributions is January 29\n\nIf you want to commit to a contribution, or have questions, or comments, please send an e-mail to the mailinglist [observatory@lists.constantvzw.org] in the coming days so we can all coordinate.\n\n\n\n\n----\n\n\nChristoph: Style guide, new pdf\nFemke SEND EMAIL BEFORE THE WEEKEND WITH MESSY PDF\nCarlin + Seda see if they can do something for the intro (Femke maybe joins/looks over???)\nAnita sends editors a proposal for punchcards, afterwards add on-line\nMartino + Femke + Anito: intros, before 9th\nMartino re-ask Hans\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLAST ROUNDS 2 DECEMBER\n\nPlanning\n\nBefore January 9:\n- Finish descriptions of clusters (Martino? + Femke?) NOT DONE\n- Finish introduction (Done for now? Maybe another round on Feb. 9?) DONE\n- Interview Jean Huens + transcription (Peggy) interview DONE, transcription next week Wed\n- Establish a level of editing that shows a balance between documentation and guidance (all of us try to finish the entries we took on)\n- Finish pdf to a point that no content is missing and we can start discussing design (Christoph) DONE!\n\nMeet January 9, 20h CET (1.5 hr meeting max)\n- See what still needs to be done\n- Send out e-mail to TGSO list: deadline 29 January\n\n[Carlin starts editing]\n\n9 February 12h CET: we meet to finish whatever needs to be done \nCarlin joins at 16h CET\n\nEnd February: print\nMain pads:\nhttp://pad.constantvzw.org/p/observatory.methods\nhttp://pad.constantvzw.org/p/observatory.guide\n\n---\n\nCarlin's questions\n- editing process\n*- different approach for primary materials (taken from workshop) vs framing materials created now\n*- in order to respect the documentation of the primary material (michael)\n*- how can this be a document that oscillates between \"look what cool methods we used and \"here are some things you could try out yourself\"\n\"If you are writing, you have liberties\" - if necessary, ask people who were involved in the thing to \n- order of entries\nhttp://pad.constantvzw.org/p/observatory.guide\n- incorporation of photographs, diagrams, etc\nYES!\n- small note (visit computer collections appears twice in the current html)\n(probably ok now?)\n\nlook for phrases / ways for introducing the chapters/groupings. Could be just a line? A task for someone?\nTest: http://pad.constantvzw.org/p/observatory.guide.grouping.temporality\n\nIntroduction http://pad.constantvzw.org/p/observatory.guide.introduction Peggy + FS + Seda first round\n\nAdd reference to the walk-in clinic? A description. Unlike normal guides: we have not removed the process. WARNING: there will be a mix of abstractions and concrete experiences.\n\nCarlin works on 3 entries\n\nThe interview needs to be done -> Peggy\n\nHans e-mail -> Martino\nAna + Ricardo -> Femke\n\nFor each of the chapter descriptions: quote from the materials/reader?

Testing this testbed at a local Constant workshop led to the meta-project of testing software meant for testing software. \n*How: The interwebs hosts many projects that aim to produce software for observing software, (from now on Software With Observatory Ambitions (SWOA)). A comparative methodology can be produced by using different SWOA to observe software of interest. Example: use different sniffing software to observe wireless networks. Doing so reveals what is seen as worthy of observation (e.g., what protocols, what space, which devices), the granularity of the observation (e.g., how is the observation captured, in what detail), the logo and conceptual framework of choice etc. \n*Where/when/situation?: Ideally, SWOA can be used everywhere. In reality, institutions, laws and administrators like to control the use of SWOA on infrastructures not also run by the people running it. Hence, we get distinctions like researchers and pen testers (e.g., they were hired) vs. hackers. \n*What: Deep philosophical moment: most software has a recursive observatory ambition (it wants to be observed in its execution, output etc.). Debuggers, logs, dashboards are all instances of software with observatory ambitions and can not be separated from software itself. So, what separates SWOA from software itself? HELP! \n*Who/with: If you can run the SWOA (many of these are promises more than running software/available code), you can do it. The question is: will people like it if you observe their SWOA?\n*Why/urgency/ [this is maybe related to the engagement question?]: If critical engagement in software is a thing, it follows that people would develop software to observe. \n*Note: [anything that did not fit above.]\n*WARNING: \n*REMEMBER: Good SWOA software usually uses an animal as a logo.:D\n*See also: making a bestiary of visual cultures/logos around it\n\n*Method: Rearranging space as conditioning observations (WTC vs. Museum vs. University vs. Startup Office vs. Shifting Walls that became Water Fountains)\n*By: [who developed, tested, proposed this method]\n*How: [ideas for how the observation method can be applied]\n*Where/when: [in what situation, space, circumstances does the observation take place]\n*What: [what/who gets observed.

Some of the play would come in from the mix of recognizable and common methods (visit a museum (ie. Namur and Leuven), conduct interviews (ie. with Jean Heuns but also as Relational software observatory consultancy service), organize and hold a worksession (ie. what we did), listen to an expert (ie.

(now under the essentials)\nShe Does Not Feel Lost.\nWhat scale of conversation? Intro could do with some tweaking, but in general works.\nRead through half of the methods. Feels familiar. Need to hand it to interested people that were not at the workshop.\nSend this to people that were at TGSO first.\nLikes the mix: Conversational and some more 'technical'.\n\nSeda also had a look -- some things to add and remove ... introduction (stops with freelancer-utopia, but what about turkers, clickworkers, on-line task workers ...)\nMight need something on services in the clinic description.

In the mean time, Anita, Martino, Carlin, Peggy, Seda, Michael, Femke have been joined by Christoph to work on The Guide To Techno-Galactic Software Observation.\n\nWe have been trying to put together a collection that works both as a documentation of the session and as a /new/ publication. As part of this we have created a list of methods for software observation that are drawn from the worksession documentation. We chose to show the materials in terms of methods for observation, hoping this loose frame can welcome irony and bending.\nWhile we are trying to reach some density and coherence, the guide does not aim for completeness. Rather we hope to give an impression of the variety of tones and materials that were manifested during our 6 days together. Now that there is some basic structure for the guide, we would like to invite you, our fellow observers, to add materials and/or add methods you feel must be in THE guide to techno-galactic software observation!\n\nHere is a first pdf: xxxxx [LINK HERE]. \nYou can find the live index to all methods so far: \n    http://pad.constantvzw.org/p/observatory.guide \n    (there is some markup added for generating the guide directly from pads, obviously). \nYou are welcome to update/complete/correct existing items or to add new ones.\n\nSome examples of more or less 'complete' methods that you can copy from: \n    https://pad.constantvzw.org/p/observatory.guide.agile.yoga , \n    https://pad.constantvzw.org/p/observatory.guide.somethinginthemiddlemaybe , \n    https://pad.constantvzw.org/p/observatory.guide.visit , \n    https://pad.constantvzw.org/p/observatory.guide.monopsychism\n\nStyle guide below!\n\nIf you would like to make use of the notes from the worksession, you can find the pages indexed here: \n    http://observatory.constantvzw.org/etherdump/_new_index.html\n\nWe have only a short window of time to put this together so that we can meet the publication deadline. The deadline for your contributions is January 29\n\nIf you want to commit to a contribution, or have questions, or comments, please send an e-mail to the mailinglist [observatory@lists.constantvzw.org] in the coming days so we can all coordinate.\n\ng\n\n\n----\n\n\nLAST ROUNDS 2 DECEMBER\n\nPlanning\n\nBefore January 9:\n- Finish descriptions of clusters (Martino? + Femke?) NOT DONE\n- Finish introduction (Done for now? Maybe another round on Feb. 9?) DONE\n- Interview Jean Huens + transcription (Peggy) interview DONE, transcription next week Wed\n- Establish a level of editing that shows a balance between documentation and guidance (all of us try to finish the entries we took on)\n- Finish pdf to a point that no content is missing and we can start discussing design (Christoph) DONE!\n\nMeet January 9, 20h CET (1.5 hr meeting max)\n- See what still needs to be done\n- Send out e-mail to TGSO list: deadline 29 January\n\n[Carlin starts editing]\n\n9 February 12h CET: we meet to finish whatever needs to be done \nCarlin joins at 16h CET\n\nEnd February: print\nMain pads:\nhttp://pad.constantvzw.org/p/observatory.methods\nhttp://pad.constantvzw.org/p/observatory.guide\n\n---\n\nCarlin's questions\n- editing process\n*- different approach for primary materials (taken from workshop) vs framing materials created now\n*- in order to respect the documentation of the primary material (michael)\n*- how can this be a document that oscillates between \"look what cool methods we used and \"here are some things you could try out yourself\"\n\"If you are writing, you have liberties\" - if necessary, ask people who were involved in the thing to \n- order of entries\nhttp://pad.constantvzw.org/p/observatory.guide\n- incorporation of photographs, diagrams, etc\nYES!\n- small note (visit computer collections appears twice in the current html)\n(probably ok now?)\n\nlook for phrases / ways for introducing the chapters/groupings.

Testing this testbed at a local Constant workshop led to the meta-project of testing software meant for testing software. \n*How: The interwebs hosts many projects that aim to produce software for observing software, (from now on Software With Observatory Ambitions (SWOA)). A comparative methodology can be produced by using different SWOA to observe software of interest. Example: use different sniffing software to observe wireless networks. Doing so reveals what is seen as worthy of observation (e.g., what protocols, what space, which devices), the granularity of the observation (e.g., how is the observation captured, in what detail), the logo and conceptual framework of choice etc. \n*Where/when/situation?: Ideally, SWOA can be used everywhere. In reality, institutions, laws and administrators like to control the use of SWOA on infrastructures not also run by the people running it. Hence, we get distinctions like researchers and pen testers (e.g., they were hired) vs. hackers. \n*What: Deep philosophical moment: most software has a recursive observatory ambition (it wants to be observed in its execution, output etc.). Debuggers, logs, dashboards are all instances of software with observatory ambitions and can not be separated from software itself. So, what separates SWOA from software itself? HELP! \n*Who/with: If you can run the SWOA (many of these are promises more than running software/available code), you can do it. The question is: will people like it if you observe their SWOA?\n*Why/urgency/ [this is maybe related to the engagement question?]: If critical engagement in software is a thing, it follows that people would develop software to observe. \n*Note: [anything that did not fit above.]\n*WARNING: \n*REMEMBER: Good SWOA software usually uses an animal as a logo.:D\n*See also: making a bestiary of visual cultures/logos around it\n\n*Method: Rearranging space as conditioning observations (WTC vs. Museum vs. University vs. Startup Office vs. Shifting Walls that became Water Fountains)\n*By: [who developed, tested, proposed this method]\n*How: [ideas for how the observation method can be applied]\n*Where/when: [in what situation, space, circumstances does the observation take place]\n*What: [what/who gets observed.

In the mean time, Anita, Martino, Carlin, Peggy, Seda, Michael, Femke have been joined by Christoph to work on The Guide To Techno-Galactic Software Observation.\n\nWe have been trying to put together a collection that works both as a documentation of the session and as a /new/ publication. As part of this we have created a list of methods for software observation that are drawn from the worksession documentation. We chose to show the materials in terms of methods for observation, hoping this loose frame can welcome irony and bending.\nWhile we are trying to reach some density and coherence, the guide does not aim for completeness. Rather we hope to give an impression of the variety of tones and materials that were manifested during our 6 days together. Now that there is some basic structure for the guide, we would like to invite you, our fellow observers, to add materials and/or add methods you feel must be in THE guide to techno-galactic software observation!\n\nHere is a first pdf: [LINK HERE]. \nYou can find the live index to all methods so far: \n    http://pad.constantvzw.org/p/observatory.guide\n    There is some markup added for generating the guide directly from pads, obviously. A few of the things missing from this pdf: A transcription from an interview with Jean Huens (Peggy), Hans' t has re-\nYou are welcome to update/complete/correct existing items or to add new ones.\n\nSome examples of more or less 'complete' methods that you can copy from: \n    https://pad.constantvzw.org/p/observatory.guide.agile.yoga , \n    https://pad.constantvzw.org/p/observatory.guide.somethinginthemiddlemaybe , \n    https://pad.constantvzw.org/p/observatory.guide.visit , \n    https://pad.constantvzw.org/p/observatory.guide.monopsychism\n\nStyle guide below!\n\nIf you would like to make use of the notes from the worksession, you can find the pages indexed here: \n    http://observatory.constantvzw.org/etherdump/_new_index.html\n\nWe have only a short window of time to put this together so that we can meet the publication deadline. The deadline for your contributions is January 29\n\nIf you want to commit to a contribution, or have questions, or comments, please send an e-mail to the mailinglist [observatory@lists.constantvzw.org] in the coming days so we can all coordinate.\n\n\n\n\n----\n\n\n\n\n\nLAST ROUNDS 2 DECEMBER\n\nPlanning\n\nBefore January 9:\n- Finish descriptions of clusters (Martino? + Femke?) NOT DONE\n- Finish introduction (Done for now? Maybe another round on Feb. 9?) DONE\n- Interview Jean Huens + transcription (Peggy) interview DONE, transcription next week Wed\n- Establish a level of editing that shows a balance between documentation and guidance (all of us try to finish the entries we took on)\n- Finish pdf to a point that no content is missing and we can start discussing design (Christoph) DONE!\n\nMeet January 9, 20h CET (1.5 hr meeting max)\n- See what still needs to be done\n- Send out e-mail to TGSO list: deadline 29 January\n\n[Carlin starts editing]\n\n9 February 12h CET: we meet to finish whatever needs to be done \nCarlin joins at 16h CET\n\nEnd February: print\nMain pads:\nhttp://pad.constantvzw.org/p/observatory.methods\nhttp://pad.constantvzw.org/p/observatory.guide\n\n---\n\nCarlin's questions\n- editing process\n*- different approach for primary materials (taken from workshop) vs framing materials created now\n*- in order to respect the documentation of the primary material (michael)\n*- how can this be a document that oscillates between \"look what cool methods we used and \"here are some things you could try out yourself\"\n\"If you are writing, you have liberties\" - if necessary, ask people who were involved in the thing to \n- order of entries\nhttp://pad.constantvzw.org/p/observatory.guide\n- incorporation of photographs, diagrams, etc\nYES!\n- small note (visit computer collections appears twice in the current html)\n(probably ok now?)\n\nlook for phrases / ways for introducing the chapters/groupings. Could be just a line? A task for someone?\nTest: http://pad.constantvzw.org/p/observatory.guide.grouping.temporality\n\nIntroduction http://pad.constantvzw.org/p/observatory.guide.introduction Peggy + FS + Seda first round\n\nAdd reference to the walk-in clinic? A description. Unlike normal guides: we have not removed the process. WARNING: there will be a mix of abstractions and concrete experiences.\n\nCarlin works on 3 entries\n\nThe interview needs to be done -> Peggy\n\nHans e-mail -> Martino\nAna + Ricardo -> Femke\n\nFor each of the chapter descriptions: quote from the materials/reader? Could be an image. Or a short inspirational phrase? -> Martino tries\nhttp://pad.constantvzw.org/p/observatory.guide\n\nAn email to other TGSO participants, call for help/see if further material is available (once the PDF is more stable)\n\nWARNING: pad fatigue might occur\n\nlatex todo:\n* be able to force empty new lines  (f.ex to put back lines in scrollresistance)\n* differentiate code quotes from pad quotes\n\n\n\n\n\nSAS Survival Handbook: The Ultimate Guide to Surviving Anywhere \nhttps://archive.org/stream/SASSurvivalHandbookTheUltimateGuideToSurvivingAnywhere/AppNee.com.SAS.Survival.Handbook.2nd.Edition#page/n359/mode/2up\nThe  Rudiments Of Wisdom encyclopaedia by Tim Hunkin.\nhttp://www.rudimentsofwisdom.com\n\nissue: different materials. works well to situate the week. fr an interview, a good way to introduce. but with folders, code ... so brought the SAS guide.

What software category does it apply to agile/SaaS?]\n*Who: [who/what gets to observe]\n*Why: [what is the engagement, of the observer with the observed and vice versa]\n*Note: [anything that did not fit above.]\n\n*Method: Testing the testbed: testing software with observatory ambitions (SWOA)\n*By/history/source/origin/process: the \"original testbed\" was proposed by researchers/collaborators in Princeton. Testing this testbed at a local Constant workshop led to the meta-project of testing software meant for testing software. \n*How: The interwebs hosts many projects that aim to produce software for observing software, (from now on Software With Observatory Ambitions (SWOA)). A comparative methodology can be produced by using different SWOA to observe software of interest. Example: use different sniffing software to observe wireless networks. Doing so reveals what is seen as worthy of observation (e.g., what protocols, what space, which devices), the granularity of the observation (e.g., how is the observation captured, in what detail), the logo and conceptual framework of choice etc. \n*Where/when/situation?: Ideally, SWOA can be used everywhere. In reality, institutions, laws and administrators like to control the use of SWOA on infrastructures not also run by the people running it. Hence, we get distinctions like researchers and pen testers (e.g., they were hired) vs. hackers. \n*What: Deep philosophical moment: most software has a recursive observatory ambition (it wants to be observed in its execution, output etc.). Debuggers, logs, dashboards are all instances of software with observatory ambitions and can not be separated from software itself. So, what separates SWOA from software itself? HELP! \n*Who/with: If you can run the SWOA (many of these are promises more than running software/available code), you can do it.

One way to handle the publication/documentation tension would be to structure a publication around a set of ways of knowing/methods and then select and shape documentation from the worksession as samples of these methods or taking moments from the workshop as prompts for reflection on these methods. Some of the play would come in from the mix of recognizable and common methods (visit a museum (ie. Namur and Leuven), conduct interviews (ie. with Jean Heuns but also as Relational software observatory consultancy service), organize and hold a worksession (ie. what we did), listen to an expert (ie. sidechannel)) with the less common ones (ie. create a bestiary of software logos, engaging with code through collective reading/performance, etc). \n\n\n\n\nChapters/sections\n\n-possible

In the mean time, Anita, Martino, Carlin, Peggy, Seda, Michael, Femke have been joined by Christoph to work on The Guide To Techno-Galactic Software Observation.\n\nWe have been trying to put together a collection that works both as a documentation of the session and as a /new/ publication. As part of this we have created a list of methods for software observation that are drawn from the worksession documentation. We chose to show the materials in terms of methods for observation, hoping this loose frame can welcome irony and bending.\nWhile we are trying to reach some density and coherence, the guide does not aim for completeness. Rather we hope to give an impression of the variety of tones and materials that were manifested during our 6 days together. Now that there is some basic structure for the guide, we would like to invite you, our fellow observers, to add materials and/or add methods you feel must be in THE guide to techno-galactic software observation!\n\nHere is a first pdf: [LINK HERE]. \nYou can find the live index to all methods so far: \n    http://pad.constantvzw.org/p/observatory.guide\n    There is some markup added for generating the guide directly from pads, obviously. A few of the things missing from this pdf: A transcription from an interview with Jean Huens (Peggy), Hans' text on time, Anita contribution on punchcards. And a thousand other small things.\n\nYou are welcome to update/complete/correct existing items or to add new ones. Some examples of more or less 'complete' methods that you can copy from: \n    https://pad.constantvzw.org/p/observatory.guide.agile.yoga , \n    https://pad.constantvzw.org/p/observatory.guide.somethinginthemiddlemaybe , \n    https://pad.constantvzw.org/p/observatory.guide.visit , \n    https://pad.constantvzw.org/p/observatory.guide.monopsychism\n\nStyle guide below!\n\nIf you would like to make use of the notes from the worksession, you can find the pages indexed here: \n    http://observatory.constantvzw.org/etherdump/_new_index.html\n\nWe have only a short window of time to put this together so that we can meet the publication deadline. The deadline for your contributions is January 29\n\nIf you want to commit to a contribution, or have questions, or comments, please send an e-mail to the mailinglist [observatory@lists.constantvzw.org] in the coming days so we can all coordinate.\n\n\nThe Techno-Galactic Software Observation Guide uses an e\n\n\nCURRENT MARKUP\n\n\n\n\n----\n\n\n\n\n\nLAST ROUNDS 2 DECEMBER\n\nPlanning\n\nBefore January 9:\n- Finish descriptions of clusters (Martino? + Femke?) NOT DONE\n- Finish introduction (Done for now? Maybe another round on Feb. 9?) DONE\n- Interview Jean Huens + transcription (Peggy) interview DONE, transcription next week Wed\n- Establish a level of editing that shows a balance between documentation and guidance (all of us try to finish the entries we took on)\n- Finish pdf to a point that no content is missing and we can start discussing design (Christoph) DONE!\n\nMeet January 9, 20h CET (1.5 hr meeting max)\n- See what still needs to be done\n- Send out e-mail to TGSO list: deadline 29 January\n\n[Carlin starts editing]\n\n9 February 12h CET: we meet to finish whatever needs to be done \nCarlin joins at 16h CET\n\nEnd February: print\nMain pads:\nhttp://pad.constantvzw.org/p/observatory.methods\nhttp://pad.constantvzw.org/p/observatory.guide\n\n---\n\nCarlin's questions\n- editing process\n*- different approach for primary materials (taken from workshop) vs framing materials created now\n*- in order to respect the documentation of the primary material (michael)\n*- how can this be a document that oscillates between \"look what cool methods we used and \"here are some things you could try out yourself\"\n\"If you are writing, you have liberties\" - if necessary, ask people who were involved in the thing to \n- order of entries\nhttp://pad.constantvzw.org/p/observatory.guide\n- incorporation of photographs, diagrams, etc\nYES!\n- small note (visit computer collections appears twice in the current html)\n(probably ok now?)\n\nlook for phrases / ways for introducing the chapters/groupings. Could be just a line? A task for someone?\nTest: http://pad.constantvzw.org/p/observatory.guide.grouping.temporality\n\nIntroduction http://pad.constantvzw.org/p/observatory.guide.introduction Peggy + FS + Seda first round\n\nAdd reference to the walk-in clinic? A description. Unlike normal guides: we have not removed the process.

Testing this testbed at a local Constant workshop led to the meta-project of testing software meant for testing software. \n*How: The interwebs hosts many projects that aim to produce software for observing software, (from now on Software With Observatory Ambitions (SWOA)). A comparative methodology can be produced by using different SWOA to observe software of interest. Example: use different sniffing software to observe wireless networks. Doing so reveals what is seen as worthy of observation (e.g., what protocols, what space, which devices), the granularity of the observation (e.g., how is the observation captured, in what detail), the logo and conceptual framework of choice etc. \n*Where/when/situation?: Ideally, SWOA can be used everywhere. In reality, institutions, laws and administrators like to control the use of SWOA on infrastructures not also run by the people running it. Hence, we get distinctions like researchers and pen testers (e.g., they were hired) vs. hackers. \n*What: Deep philosophical moment: most software has a recursive observatory ambition (it wants to be observed in its execution, output etc.). Debuggers, logs, dashboards are all instances of software with observatory ambitions and can not be separated from software itself. So, what separates SWOA from software itself? HELP! \n*Who/with: If you can run the SWOA (many of these are promises more than running software/available code), you can do it. The question is: will people like it if you observe their SWOA?\n*Why/urgency/ [this is maybe related to the engagement question?]: If critical engagement in software is a thing, it follows that people would develop software to observe. \n*Note: [anything that did not fit above.]\n*WARNING: \n*REMEMBER: Good SWOA software usually uses an animal as a logo.:D\n*See also: making a bestiary of visual cultures/logos around it\n\n*Method: Rearranging space as conditioning observations (WTC vs. Museum vs. University vs. Startup Office vs. Shifting Walls that became Water Fountains)\n*By: [who developed, tested, proposed this method]\n*How: [ideas for how the observation method can be applied]\n*Where/when: [in what situation, space, circumstances does the observation take place]\n*What: [what/who gets observed.

Namur and Leuven), conduct interviews (ie. with Jean Heuns but also as Relational software observatory consultancy service), organize and hold a worksession (ie. what we did), listen to an expert (ie.

Some of the play would come in from the mix of recognizable and common methods (visit a museum (ie. Namur and Leuven), conduct interviews (ie. with Jean Heuns but also as Relational software observatory consultancy service), organize and hold a worksession (ie. what we did), listen to an expert (ie. sidechannel)) with the less common ones (ie. create a bestiary of software logos, engaging with code through collective reading/performance, etc). \n\n\n\n\nChapters/sections\n\n-possible groupings..\n\n","meta":{"author":"","timestamp":1513950496131}},"pad:observatory.methods:revs:380":{"changeset":"Z:k07<1|h=ib=2g-1$","meta":{"author":"a.ocPhP3HyN6Ppfg6m","timestamp":1515525334720}},"pad:observatory.methods:revs:3800":{"changeset":"Z:p21>4|3y=5xs=c*4+4$alll","meta":{"author":"a.eJQfyC3773rYpTah","timestamp":1515578331969,"atext":{"text":"http://pad.constantvzw.org/p/observatory.afterlives\nhttp://pad.constantvzw.org/p/observatory.inventory\nhttp://pad.constantvzw.org/p/observatory.guide --> 1-2 December\n\n9 JANUARY MEETING\n\nTO DO BEFORE 9 FEBRUARY\n\nChristoph: Style guide, new pdf\nChristoph: take care of backup\nFemke SEND EMAIL BEFORE THE WEEKEND WITH MESSY PDF\nCarlin + Seda see if they can do something for the intro (Femke maybe joins/looks over [will do!])\nAnita sends editors a proposal for punchcards, afterwards add on-line\nMartino + Femke + Anita (rescue, also): intros, 14h CET 31/01\nMartino re-ask Hans\nAll: go through methods we started/adopted\n[Carlin rereads Peggy's transcription]\n\n--\n\nAgenda for tonight meeting: \nTHE INTERNATIONAL MEETING\n- See what still needs to be done\n- Send out e-mail to TGSO list: deadline 29 January\n\nMeet here at 20h CET https://meet.jit.si/observatory\n\nEditing\nCarlin has been reading, working on some items.

In the mean time, Anita, Martino, Carlin, Peggy, Seda, Michael, Femke have been joined by Christoph to work on The Guide To Techno-Galactic Software Observation.\n\nWe have been trying to put together a collection that works both as a documentation of the session and as a /new/ publication. As part of this we have created a list of methods for software observation that are drawn from the worksession documentation. We chose to show the materials in terms of methods for observation, hoping this loose frame can welcome irony and bending.\nWhile we are trying to reach some density and coherence, the guide does not aim for completeness. Rather we hope to give an impression of the variety of tones and materials that were manifested during our 6 days together. Now that there is some basic structure for the guide, we would like to invite you, our fellow observers, to add materials and/or add methods you feel must be in THE guide to techno-galactic software observation!\n\nHere is a first pdf: [LINK HERE]. \nYou can find the live index to all methods so far: \n    http://pad.constantvzw.org/p/observatory.guide\n    There is some markup added for generating the guide directly from pads, obviously. A few of the things missing from this pdf: A transcription from an interview with Jean Huens (Peggy), Hans' text on time, Anita contribution on punchcards. And a thousand other small things.\n\nYou are welcome to update/complete/correct existing items or to add new ones. Some examples of more or less 'complete' methods that you can copy from: \n    https://pad.constantvzw.org/p/observatory.guide.agile.yoga , \n    https://pad.constantvzw.org/p/observatory.guide.somethinginthemiddlemaybe , \n    https://pad.constantvzw.org/p/observatory.guide.visit , \n    https://pad.constantvzw.org/p/observatory.guide.monopsychism\n\nStyle guide below!\n\nIf you would like to make use of the notes from the worksession, you can find the pages indexed here: \n    http://observatory.constantvzw.org/etherdump/_new_index.html\n\nWe have only a short window of time to put this together so that we can meet the publication deadline. The deadline for your contributions is January 29\n\nIf you want to commit to a contribution, or have questions, or comments, please send an e-mail to the mailinglist [observatory@lists.constantvzw.org] in the coming days so we can all coordinate.\n\n\nThe Techno-Galactic Software Observation Guide uses an extended dialect of markdown.\nYou may use alll\n\n\nCURRENT MARKUP\n\n\n\nFUTURE MARKUP\n\n\n----\n\n\n\n\n\nLAST ROUNDS 2 DECEMBER\n\nPlanning\n\nBefore January 9:\n- Finish descriptions of clusters (Martino? + Femke?) NOT DONE\n- Finish introduction (Done for now? Maybe another round on Feb. 9?) DONE\n- Interview Jean Huens + transcription (Peggy) interview DONE, transcription next week Wed\n- Establish a level of editing that shows a balance between documentation and guidance (all of us try to finish the entries we took on)\n- Finish pdf to a point that no content is missing and we can start discussing design (Christoph) DONE!\n\nMeet January 9, 20h CET (1.5 hr meeting max)\n- See what still needs to be done\n- Send out e-mail to TGSO list: deadline 29 January\n\n[Carlin starts editing]\n\n9 February 12h CET: we meet to finish whatever needs to be done \nCarlin joins at 16h CET\n\nEnd February: print\nMain pads:\nhttp://pad.constantvzw.org/p/observatory.methods\nhttp://pad.constantvzw.org/p/observatory.guide\n\n---\n\nCarlin's questions\n- editing process\n*- different approach for primary materials (taken from workshop) vs framing materials created now\n*- in order to respect the documentation of the primary material (michael)\n*- how can this be a document that oscillates between \"look what cool methods we used and \"here are some things you could try out yourself\"\n\"If you are writing, you have liberties\" - if necessary, ask people who were involved in the thing to \n- order of entries\nhttp://pad.constantvzw.org/p/observatory.guide\n- incorporation of photographs, diagrams, etc\nYES!\n- small note (visit computer collections appears twice in the current html)\n(probably ok now?)\n\nlook for phrases / ways for introducing the chapters/groupings.

A task for someone?\nTest: http://pad.constantvzw.org/p/observatory.guide.grouping.temporality\n\nIntroduction http://pad.constantvzw.org/p/observatory.guide.introduction Peggy + FS + Seda first round\n\nAdd reference to the walk-in clinic? A description. Unlike normal guides: we have not removed the process. WARNING: there will be a mix of abstractions and concrete experiences.\n\nCarlin works on 3 entries\n\nThe interview needs to be done -> Peggy\n\nHans e-mail -> Martino\nAna + Ricardo -> Femke\n\nFor each of the chapter descriptions: quote from the materials/reader? Could be an image. Or a short inspirational phrase? -> Martino tries\nhttp://pad.constantvzw.org/p/observatory.guide\n\nAn email to other TGSO participants, call for help/see if further material is available (once the PDF is more stable)\n\nWARNING: pad fatigue might occur\n\nlatex todo:\n* be able to force empty new lines  (f.ex to put back lines in scrollresistance)\n* differentiate code quotes from pad quotes\n\n\n\n\n\nSAS Survival Handbook: The Ultimate Guide to Surviving Anywhere \nhttps://archive.org/stream/SASSurvivalHandbookTheUltimateGuideToSurvivingAnywhere/AppNee.com.SAS.Survival.Handbook.2nd.Edition#page/n359/mode/2up\nThe  Rudiments Of Wisdom encyclopaedia by Tim Hunkin.\nhttp://www.rudimentsofwisdom.com\n\nissue: different materials. works well to situate the week. fr an interview, a good way to introduce. but with folders, code ... so brought the SAS guide.

What software category does it apply to agile/SaaS?]\n*Who: [who/what gets to observe]\n*Why: [what is the engagement, of the observer with the observed and vice versa]\n*Note: [anything that did not fit above.]\n\n*Method: Testing the testbed: testing software with observatory ambitions (SWOA)\n*By/history/source/origin/process: the \"original testbed\" was proposed by researchers/collaborators in Princeton. Testing this testbed at a local Constant workshop led to the meta-project of testing software meant for testing software. \n*How: The interwebs hosts many projects that aim to produce software for observing software, (from now on Software With Observatory Ambitions (SWOA)). A comparative methodology can be produced by using different SWOA to observe software of interest. Example: use different sniffing software to observe wireless networks. Doing so reveals what is seen as worthy of observation (e.g., what protocols, what space, which devices), the granularity of the observation (e.g., how is the observation captured, in what detail), the logo and conceptual framework of choice etc. \n*Where/when/situation?: Ideally, SWOA can be used everywhere. In reality, institutions, laws and administrators like to control the use of SWOA on infrastructures not also run by the people running it. Hence, we get distinctions like researchers and pen testers (e.g., they were hired) vs. hackers. \n*What: Deep philosophical moment: most software has a recursive observatory ambition (it wants to be observed in its execution, output etc.).

One way to handle the publication/documentation tension would be to structure a publication around a set of ways of knowing/methods and then select and shape documentation from the worksession as samples of these methods or taking moments from the workshop as prompts for reflection on these methods. Some of the play would come in from the mix of recognizable and common methods (visit a museum (ie. Namur and Leuven), conduct interviews (ie. with Jean Heuns but also as Relational software observatory consultancy service), organize and hold a worksession (ie. what we did), listen to an expert (ie. sidechannel)) with the less common ones (ie. create a bestiary of software logos, engaging with code through collective reading/performance, etc). \n\n\n\n\nChapters/sections\n\n-possible

Editing glossary.\nQuestion: what about this warning:\nhttp://pad.constantvzw.org/p/observatory.guide.warning -- it is a meta-warning that should go first? (now under the essentials)\nShe Does Not Feel Lost.\nWhat scale of conversation? Intro could do with some tweaking, but in general works.\nRead through half of the methods. Feels familiar. Need to hand it to interested people that were not at the workshop.\nSend this to people that were at TGSO first.\nLikes the mix: Conversational and some more 'technical'.\n\nSeda also had a look -- some things to add and remove ... introduction (stops with freelancer-utopia, but what about turkers, clickworkers, on-line task workers ...)\nMight need something on services in the clinic description. Some humor!\nIn general: we could be funnier and more surreal! Funny + sharp. Could use some edge. \"We cannot be funny with software right now\"\nDatabases of populations (El Salvadoreans about to be deported, India's biometric database being sold to journalists etc)\nEmergency ... games of words. Needs some push.\nContinuous integration missing from html?\n\nhttps://pad.constantvzw.org/p/observatory.guide.introduction\nTension in the introduction. First: critical distance, then entanglement. Need to name it/connect it. Helps to tie in the quote?\nLater: \"going beyond\" ... MMo -- need to reformulate. Make quote (why it is there) more xplicit.\nDistance can be critical but not always. \n\n\nWork a bit more on the introduction, this can work on its own?\nSo the text should be a text to be read that stands on its own and does work on its own. \nMaybe the introduction needs to be more explicitly political.\n\nSeda looked for methods -- there are some missing. Christoph will make them appear!\nAlso: if we open to others, they will bring new energy.\nCalendar App Collapsing!\nPeggy: we can do this on the 9th? Or maybe not. \nSeda: separate time for sharpening the introduction, to keep serioussnes and humor together.\n\nCluster descriptions not done yet/not in the html.

Anecdotes.\n(CH: what about the interview, where/how to put it?)\nLet's just put it into the https://pad.constantvzw.org/p/observatory.guide.jean.heuns pad\ndon't mind the formatting right now.\nAn hour of conversation. Keeping all of it? An excerpt? Use extracts through the quide.\nDecide on the 9th of February 2018 ?\nPeggy will do the transcription anyways.

In the mean time, Anita, Martino, Carlin, Peggy, Seda, Michael, Femke have been joined by Christoph to work on The Guide To Techno-Galactic Software Observation.\n\nWe have been trying to put together a collection that works both as a documentation of the session and as a /new/ publication. As part of this we have created a list of methods for software observation that are drawn from the worksession documentation. We chose to show the materials in terms of methods for observation, hoping this loose frame can welcome irony and bending.\nWhile we are trying to reach some density and coherence, the guide does not aim for completeness. Rather we hope to give an impression of the variety of tones and materials that were manifested during our 6 days together. Now that there is some basic structure for the guide, we would like to invite you, our fellow observers, to add materials and/or add methods you feel must be in THE guide to techno-galactic software observation!\n\nHere is a first pdf: [LINK HERE]. \nYou can find the live index to all methods so far: \n    http://pad.constantvzw.org/p/observatory.guide\n    There is some markup added for generating the guide directly from pads, obviously. A few of the things missing from this pdf: A transcription from an interview with Jean Huens (Peggy), Hans' text on time, Anita contribution on punchcards. And a thousand other small things.\n\nYou are welcome to update/complete/correct existing items or to add new ones. Some examples of more or less 'complete' methods that you can copy from: \n    https://pad.constantvzw.org/p/observatory.guide.agile.yoga , \n    https://pad.constantvzw.org/p/observatory.guide.somethinginthemiddlemaybe , \n    https://pad.constantvzw.org/p/observatory.guide.visit , \n    https://pad.constantvzw.org/p/observatory.guide.monopsychism\n\nStyle guide below!\n\nIf you would like to make use of the notes from the worksession, you can find the pages indexed here: \n    http://observatory.constantvzw.org/etherdump/_new_index.html\n\nWe have only a short window of time to put this together so that we can meet the publication deadline. The deadline for your contributions is January 29\n\nIf you want to commit to a contribution, or have questions, or comments, please send an e-mail to the mailinglist [observatory@lists.constantvzw.org] in the coming days so we can all coordinate.\n\n\nThe Techno-Galactic Software Observation Guide uses an extended dialect of markdown.\nNext to classic markdown ( https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown ) you can\nwrite instructions\n\n\nCURRENT MARKUP\n--------------\n\n\nFUTURE MARKUP\n-------------\n\nThe markup dialect develops during the editing process.\n\n\n\n\n----\n\n\n\n\n\nLAST ROUNDS 2 DECEMBER\n\nPlanning\n\nBefore January 9:\n- Finish descriptions of clusters (Martino? + Femke?) NOT DONE\n- Finish introduction (Done for now? Maybe another round on Feb. 9?) DONE\n- Interview Jean Huens + transcription (Peggy) interview DONE, transcription next week Wed\n- Establish a level of editing that shows a balance between documentation and guidance (all of us try to finish the entries we took on)\n- Finish pdf to a point that no content is missing and we can start discussing design (Christoph) DONE!\n\nMeet January 9, 20h CET (1.5 hr meeting max)\n- See what still needs to be done\n- Send out e-mail to TGSO list: deadline 29 January\n\n[Carlin starts editing]\n\n9 February 12h CET: we meet to finish whatever needs to be done \nCarlin joins at 16h CET\n\nEnd February: print\nMain pads:\nhttp://pad.constantvzw.org/p/observatory.methods\nhttp://pad.constantvzw.org/p/observatory.guide\n\n---\n\nCarlin's questions\n- editing process\n*- different approach for primary materials (taken from workshop) vs framing materials created now\n*- in order to respect the documentation of the primary material (michael)\n*- how can this be a document that oscillates between \"look what cool methods we used and \"here are some things you could try out yourself\"\n\"If you are writing, you have liberties\" - if necessary, ask people who were involved in the thing to \n- order of entries\nhttp://pad.constantvzw.org/p/observatory.guide\n- incorporation of photographs, diagrams, etc\nYES!\n- small note (visit computer collections appears twice in the current html)\n(probably ok now?)\n\nlook for phrases / ways for introducing the chapters/groupings. Could be just a line? A task for someone?\nTest: http://pad.constantvzw.org/p/observatory.guide.grouping.temporality\n\nIntroduction http://pad.constantvzw.org/p/observatory.guide.introduction Peggy + FS + Seda first round\n\nAdd reference to the walk-in clinic? A description. Unlike normal guides: we have not removed the process.

Testing this testbed at a local Constant workshop led to the meta-project of testing software meant for testing software. \n*How: The interwebs hosts many projects that aim to produce software for observing software, (from now on Software With Observatory Ambitions (SWOA)). A comparative methodology can be produced by using different SWOA to observe software of interest. Example: use different sniffing software to observe wireless networks. Doing so reveals what is seen as worthy of observation (e.g., what protocols, what space, which devices), the granularity of the observation (e.g., how is the observation captured, in what detail), the logo and conceptual framework of choice etc. \n*Where/when/situation?: Ideally, SWOA can be used everywhere. In reality, institutions, laws and administrators like to control the use of SWOA on infrastructures not also run by the people running it. Hence, we get distinctions like researchers and pen testers (e.g., they were hired) vs. hackers. \n*What: Deep philosophical moment: most software has a recursive observatory ambition (it wants to be observed in its execution, output etc.). Debuggers, logs, dashboards are all instances of software with observatory ambitions and can not be separated from software itself. So, what separates SWOA from software itself? HELP! \n*Who/with: If you can run the SWOA (many of these are promises more than running software/available code), you can do it. The question is: will people like it if you observe their SWOA?\n*Why/urgency/ [this is maybe related to the engagement question?]: If critical engagement in software is a thing, it follows that people would develop software to observe. \n*Note: [anything that did not fit above.]\n*WARNING: \n*REMEMBER: Good SWOA software usually uses an animal as a logo.:D\n*See also: making a bestiary of visual cultures/logos around it\n\n*Method: Rearranging space as conditioning observations (WTC vs. Museum vs. University vs. Startup Office vs. Shifting Walls that became Water Fountains)\n*By: [who developed, tested, proposed this method]\n*How: [ideas for how the observation method can be applied]\n*Where/when: [in what situation, space, circumstances does the observation take place]\n*What: [what/who gets observed.

What software category does it apply to agile/SaaS?]\n*Who: [who/what gets to observe]\n*Why: [what is the engagement, of the observer with the observed and vice versa]\n*Note: [anything that did not fit above.]\n\n*Method: Testing the testbed: testing software with observatory ambitions (SWOA)\n*By/history/source/origin/process: the \"original testbed\" was proposed by researchers/collaborators in Princeton. Testing this testbed at a local Constant workshop led to the meta-project of testing software meant for testing software. \n*How: The interwebs hosts many projects that aim to produce software for observing software, (from now on Software With Observatory Ambitions (SWOA)). A comparative methodology can be produced by using different SWOA to observe software of interest. Example: use different sniffing software to observe wireless networks. Doing so reveals what is seen as worthy of observation (e.g., what protocols, what space, which devices), the granularity of the observation (e.g., how is the observation captured, in what detail), the logo and conceptual framework of choice etc. \n*Where/when/situation?: Ideally, SWOA can be used everywhere. In reality, institutions, laws and administrators like to control the use of SWOA on infrastructures not also run by the people running it. Hence, we get distinctions like researchers and pen testers (e.g., they were hired) vs. hackers. \n*What: Deep philosophical moment: most software has a recursive observatory ambition (it wants to be observed in its execution, output etc.). Debuggers, logs, dashboards are all instances of software with observatory ambitions and can not be separated from software itself. So, what separates SWOA from software itself? HELP! \n*Who/with: If you can run the SWOA (many of these are promises more than running software/available code), you can do it. The question is: will people like it if you observe their SWOA?\n*Why/urgency/ [this is maybe related to the engagement question?]: If critical engagement in software is a thing, it follows that people would develop software to observe. \n*Note: [anything that did not fit above.]\n*WARNING: \n*REMEMBER: Good SWOA software usually uses an animal as a logo.:D\n*See also: making a bestiary of visual cultures/logos around it\n\n*Method: Rearranging space as conditioning observations (WTC vs. Museum vs. University vs. Startup Office vs. Shifting Walls that became Water Fountains)\n*By: [who developed, tested, proposed this method]\n*How: [ideas for how the observation method can be applied]\n*Where/when: [in what situation, space, circumstances does the observation take place]\n*What: [what/who gets observed.

Namur and Leuven), conduct interviews (ie. with Jean Heuns but also as Relational software observatory consultancy service), organize and hold a worksession (ie. what we did), listen to an expert (ie. sidechannel)) with the less common ones (ie. create a bestiary of software logos, engaging with code through collective reading/performance, etc). \n\n\n\n\nChapters/sections\n\n-possible groupings..\n\nFLOWS\nflow-regulation, logistics, seamlessness\ncontinuous integration\nfountains (refreshment)\netherpad->md->pdf->anything pipeline\nflowcharts excercise (Flow of the chart - chart of the flow on demand!)\nembodied flowchart-elevator\n\ntemporality\nflux\ntime-piece \ntempo of agile software/SaaS\n\nresistance\nuseless scroll against productivity\nInterface Détournement\n\nlanguaging\naquine \nglossary-excercise?\nqualifiers (secure, bad, bourgeois, queer..)\n\nhealing\nrelational software observatory consultancy service\nretrospection\nAgile Sun Salutation\nhand reading\nwhen dirty.db gets dirty\n\nclose encounters\nvisiting a museum\ninterviews\nasking the same question\ngetting down in your computer functioning (files/processes/ram)\nrelational software observatory consultancy service\nwith your future?blobservation\n\nembodiment/body techniques\nAgile Sun Salutation: see Healing\nCOLLECTIVE CHAIR YOGA!!!\nfountain \ncomportment of software (occupational hazards)\n\ncollections\nbestiary of software logos (we collect)\ncomputer history museum (institutional collection)\njean heuns collection at leuven (personal/institutional)\nTesting the testbed: testing software with observatory ambitions\n\n\nbeingontheside/inthemiddle/behind\nsomethinginthemiddlemaybe\nelevator\nside channel attacks\n\nMethods for inadequate observation of software [inadequate methods?]\n\nbut then the things in these groupings can be arranged/divided by form? like descrptive entries/ exercises/ diagrams/ conversation with/ gloss/\n\nWARNINGS\n[[warning: \"our methods for observation, like mapping, come with their luggage.\" from Thursday afternoon section of http://observatory.constantvzw.org/etherdump/toc.md.diff.html ]]\n[[warning: some of these methods are not suitable for agile software/SaaS observation]]\n\n\n","attribs":"|4+4q*0*1+h*0|4+1s*0+1f*2|1+1*0|8+7y*2+1y*0|h+g0|5+1g+1h*0+9|1+1+1w*0+5|1+1+1a*0+18|2+3t+2p*0+6|du+io5*3|1+1|1+1"}}},"pad:observatory.methods:revs:4000":{"changeset":"Z:pa9>4|42=62l=1c*4+4$rkdo","meta":{"author":"a.eJQfyC3773rYpTah","timestamp":1515579468389,"atext":{"text":"http://pad.constantvzw.org/p/observatory.afterlives\nhttp://pad.constantvzw.org/p/observatory.inventory\nhttp://pad.constantvzw.org/p/observatory.guide --> 1-2 December\n\n9 JANUARY MEETING\n\nTO DO BEFORE 9 FEBRUARY\n\nChristoph: Style guide, new pdf\nChristoph: take care of backup\nFemke SEND EMAIL BEFORE THE WEEKEND WITH MESSY PDF\nCarlin + Seda see if they can do something for the intro (Femke maybe joins/looks over [will do!])\nAnita sends editors a proposal for punchcards, afterwards add on-line\nMartino + Femke + Anita (rescue, also): intros, 14h CET 31/01\nMartino re-ask Hans\nAll: go through methods we started/adopted\n[Carlin rereads Peggy's transcription]\n\n--\n\nAgenda for tonight meeting: \nTHE INTERNATIONAL MEETING\n- See what still needs to be done\n- Send out e-mail to TGSO list: deadline 29 January\n\nMeet here at 20h CET https://meet.jit.si/observatory\n\nEditing\nCarlin has been reading, working on some items.

In the mean time, Anita, Martino, Carlin, Peggy, Seda, Michael, Femke have been joined by Christoph to work on The Guide To Techno-Galactic Software Observation.\n\nWe have been trying to put together a collection that works both as a documentation of the session and as a /new/ publication. As part of this we have created a list of methods for software observation that are drawn from the worksession documentation. We chose to show the materials in terms of methods for observation, hoping this loose frame can welcome irony and bending.\nWhile we are trying to reach some density and coherence, the guide does not aim for completeness. Rather we hope to give an impression of the variety of tones and materials that were manifested during our 6 days together. Now that there is some basic structure for the guide, we would like to invite you, our fellow observers, to add materials and/or add methods you feel must be in THE guide to techno-galactic software observation!\n\nHere is a first pdf: [LINK HERE]. \nYou can find the live index to all methods so far: \n    http://pad.constantvzw.org/p/observatory.guide\n    There is some markup added for generating the guide directly from pads, obviously. A few of the things missing from this pdf: A transcription from an interview with Jean Huens (Peggy), Hans' text on time, Anita contribution on punchcards. And a thousand other small things.\n\nYou are welcome to update/complete/correct existing items or to add new ones. Some examples of more or less 'complete' methods that you can copy from: \n    https://pad.constantvzw.org/p/observatory.guide.agile.yoga , \n    https://pad.constantvzw.org/p/observatory.guide.somethinginthemiddlemaybe , \n    https://pad.constantvzw.org/p/observatory.guide.visit , \n    https://pad.constantvzw.org/p/observatory.guide.monopsychism\n\nStyle guide below!\n\nIf you would like to make use of the notes from the worksession, you can find the pages indexed here: \n    http://observatory.constantvzw.org/etherdump/_new_index.html\n\nWe have only a short window of time to put this together so that we can meet the publication deadline. The deadline for your contributions is January 29\n\nIf you want to commit to a contribution, or have questions, or comments, please send an e-mail to the mailinglist [observatory@lists.constantvzw.org] in the coming days so we can all coordinate.\n\n\n----\n\nThe Techno-Galactic Software Observation Guide uses an extended dialect of markdown.\nNext to classic markdown ( https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown ) you can\nwrite _instruction lines_ that will affect the content during the translation to the\ndesired output. Based on the original idea of markdo\n\n\nCURRENT MARKUP\n--------------\n\n\nFUTURE MARKUP\n-------------\n\nThe markup dialect develops during the editing process.\n\n\n\n\n----\n\n\n\n\n\nLAST ROUNDS 2 DECEMBER\n\nPlanning\n\nBefore January 9:\n- Finish descriptions of clusters (Martino? + Femke?)

Testing this testbed at a local Constant workshop led to the meta-project of testing software meant for testing software. \n*How: The interwebs hosts many projects that aim to produce software for observing software, (from now on Software With Observatory Ambitions (SWOA)). A comparative methodology can be produced by using different SWOA to observe software of interest. Example: use different sniffing software to observe wireless networks. Doing so reveals what is seen as worthy of observation (e.g., what protocols, what space, which devices), the granularity of the observation (e.g., how is the observation captured, in what detail), the logo and conceptual framework of choice etc. \n*Where/when/situation?: Ideally, SWOA can be used everywhere. In reality, institutions, laws and administrators like to control the use of SWOA on infrastructures not also run by the people running it. Hence, we get distinctions like researchers and pen testers (e.g., they were hired) vs. hackers. \n*What: Deep philosophical moment: most software has a recursive observatory ambition (it wants to be observed in its execution, output etc.). Debuggers, logs, dashboards are all instances of software with observatory ambitions and can not be separated from software itself. So, what separates SWOA from software itself? HELP! \n*Who/with: If you can run the SWOA (many of these are promises more than running software/available code), you can do it. The question is: will people like it if you observe their SWOA?\n*Why/urgency/ [this is maybe related to the engagement question?]: If critical engagement in software is a thing, it follows that people would develop software to observe. \n*Note: [anything that did not fit above.]\n*WARNING: \n*REMEMBER: Good SWOA software usually uses an animal as a logo.:D\n*See also: making a bestiary of visual cultures/logos around it\n\n*Method: Rearranging space as conditioning observations (WTC vs. Museum vs. University vs. Startup Office vs. Shifting Walls that became Water Fountains)\n*By: [who developed, tested, proposed this method]\n*How: [ideas for how the observation method can be applied]\n*Where/when: [in what situation, space, circumstances does the observation take place]\n*What: [what/who gets observed.

In the mean time, Anita, Martino, Carlin, Peggy, Seda, Michael, Femke have been joined by Christoph to work on The Guide To Techno-Galactic Software Observation.\n\nWe have been trying to put together a collection that works both as a documentation of the session and as a /new/ publication. As part of this we have created a list of methods for software observation that are drawn from the worksession documentation. We chose to show the materials in terms of methods for observation, hoping this loose frame can welcome irony and bending.\nWhile we are trying to reach some density and coherence, the guide does not aim for completeness. Rather we hope to give an impression of the variety of tones and materials that were manifested during our 6 days together. Now that there is some basic structure for the guide, we would like to invite you, our fellow observers, to add materials and/or add methods you feel must be in THE guide to techno-galactic software observation!\n\nHere is a first pdf: [LINK HERE]. \nYou can find the live index to all methods so far: \n    http://pad.constantvzw.org/p/observatory.guide\n    There is some markup added for generating the guide directly from pads, obviously. A few of the things missing from this pdf: A transcription from an interview with Jean Huens (Peggy), Hans' text on time, Anita contribution on punchcards. And a thousand other small things.\n\nYou are welcome to update/complete/correct existing items or to add new ones. Some examples of more or less 'complete' methods that you can copy from: \n    https://pad.constantvzw.org/p/observatory.guide.agile.yoga , \n    https://pad.constantvzw.org/p/observatory.guide.somethinginthemiddlemaybe , \n    https://pad.constantvzw.org/p/observatory.guide.visit , \n    https://pad.constantvzw.org/p/observatory.guide.monopsychism\n\nStyle guide below!\n\nIf you would like to make use of the notes from the worksession, you can find the pages indexed here: \n    http://observatory.constantvzw.org/etherdump/_new_index.html\n\nWe have only a short window of time to put this together so that we can meet the publication deadline. The deadline for your contributions is January 29\n\nIf you want to commit to a contribution, or have questions, or comments, please send an e-mail to the mailinglist [observatory@lists.constantvzw.org] in the coming days so we can all coordinate.\n\n\n----\n\nThe Techno-Galactic Software Observation Guide uses an extended dialect of markdown.\nNext to classic markdown ( https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown ) you can\nwrite `instruction lines` that will define the translation to the desired output.\nAn `instruction line` starts with '%' and takes everything after the first colon\nas a \n\n\n\n\nCURRENT MARKUP\n--------------\n\n\nFUTURE MARKUP\n-------------\n\nThe markup vocabulary develops during the editing process.\n\n\n\n\n----\n\n\n\n\n\nLAST ROUNDS 2 DECEMBER\n\nPlanning\n\nBefore January 9:\n- Finish descriptions of clusters (Martino? + Femke?) NOT DONE\n- Finish introduction (Done for now? Maybe another round on Feb. 9?) DONE\n- Interview Jean Huens + transcription (Peggy) interview DONE, transcription next week Wed\n- Establish a level of editing that shows a balance between documentation and guidance (all of us try to finish the entries we took on)\n- Finish pdf to a point that no content is missing and we can start discussing design (Christoph) DONE!\n\nMeet January 9, 20h CET (1.5 hr meeting max)\n- See what still needs to be done\n- Send out e-mail to TGSO list: deadline 29 January\n\n[Carlin starts editing]\n\n9 February 12h CET: we meet to finish whatever needs to be done \nCarlin joins at 16h CET\n\nEnd February: print\nMain pads:\nhttp://pad.constantvzw.org/p/observatory.methods\nhttp://pad.constantvzw.org/p/observatory.guide\n\n---\n\nCarlin's questions\n- editing process\n*- different approach for primary materials (taken from workshop) vs framing materials created now\n*- in order to respect the documentation of the primary material (michael)\n*- how can this be a document that oscillates between \"look what cool methods we used and \"here are some things you could try out yourself\"\n\"If you are writing, you have liberties\" - if necessary, ask people who were involved in the thing to \n- order of entries\nhttp://pad.constantvzw.org/p/observatory.guide\n- incorporation of photographs, diagrams, etc\nYES!\n- small note (visit computer collections appears twice in the current html)\n(probably ok now?)\n\nlook for phrases / ways for introducing the chapters/groupings. Could be just a line? A task for someone?\nTest: http://pad.constantvzw.org/p/observatory.guide.grouping.temporality\n\nIntroduction http://pad.constantvzw.org/p/observatory.guide.introduction Peggy + FS + Seda first round\n\nAdd reference to the walk-in clinic? A description. Unlike normal guides: we have not removed the process. WARNING: there will be a mix of abstractions and concrete experiences.\n\nCarlin works on 3 entries\n\nThe interview needs to be done -> Peggy\n\nHans e-mail -> Martino\nAna + Ricardo -> Femke\n\nFor each of the chapter descriptions: quote from the materials/reader? Could be an image. Or a short inspirational phrase? -> Martino tries\nhttp://pad.constantvzw.org/p/observatory.guide\n\nAn email to other TGSO participants, call for help/see if further material is available (once the PDF is more stable)\n\nWARNING: pad fatigue might occur\n\nlatex todo:\n* be able to force empty new lines  (f.ex to put back lines in scrollresistance)\n* differentiate code quotes from pad quotes\n\n\n\n\n\nSAS Survival Handbook: The Ultimate Guide to Surviving Anywhere \nhttps://archive.org/stream/SASSurvivalHandbookTheUltimateGuideToSurvivingAnywhere/AppNee.com.SAS.Survival.Handbook.2nd.Edition#page/n359/mode/2up\nThe  Rudiments Of Wisdom encyclopaedia by Tim Hunkin.\nhttp://www.rudimentsofwisdom.com\n\nissue: different materials. works well to situate the week. fr an interview, a good way to introduce. but with folders, code ... so brought the SAS guide.

Testing this testbed at a local Constant workshop led to the meta-project of testing software meant for testing software. \n*How: The interwebs hosts many projects that aim to produce software for observing software, (from now on Software With Observatory Ambitions (SWOA)). A comparative methodology can be produced by using different SWOA to observe software of interest. Example: use different sniffing software to observe wireless networks. Doing so reveals what is seen as worthy of observation (e.g., what protocols, what space, which devices), the granularity of the observation (e.g., how is the observation captured, in what detail), the logo and conceptual framework of choice etc. \n*Where/when/situation?: Ideally, SWOA can be used everywhere. In reality, institutions, laws and administrators like to control the use of SWOA on infrastructures not also run by the people running it. Hence, we get distinctions like researchers and pen testers (e.g., they were hired) vs. hackers. \n*What: Deep philosophical moment: most software has a recursive observatory ambition (it wants to be observed in its execution, output etc.). Debuggers, logs, dashboards are all instances of software with observatory ambitions and can not be separated from software itself. So, what separates SWOA from software itself? HELP! \n*Who/with: If you can run the SWOA (many of these are promises more than running software/available code), you can do it.

One way to handle the publication/documentation tension would be to structure a publication around a set of ways of knowing/methods and then select and shape documentation from the worksession as samples of these methods or taking moments from the workshop as prompts for reflection on these methods. Some of the play would come in from the mix of recognizable and common methods (visit a museum (ie. Namur and Leuven), conduct interviews (ie. with Jean Heuns but also as Relational software observatory consultancy service), organize and hold a worksession (ie. what we did), listen to an expert (ie. sidechannel)) with the less common ones (ie. create a bestiary of software logos, engaging with code through collective reading/performance, etc). \n\n\n\n\nChapters/sections\n\n-possible

Editing glossary.\nQuestion: what about this warning:\nhttp://pad.constantvzw.org/p/observatory.guide.warning -- it is a meta-warning that should go first? (now under the essentials)\nShe Does Not Feel Lost.\nWhat scale of conversation? Intro could do with some tweaking, but in general works.\nRead through half of the methods. Feels familiar. Need to hand it to interested people that were not at the workshop.\nSend this to people that were at TGSO first.\nLikes the mix: Conversational and some more 'technical'.\n\nSeda also had a look -- some things to add and remove ... introduction (stops with freelancer-utopia, but what about turkers, clickworkers, on-line task workers ...)\nMight need something on services in the clinic description. Some humor!\nIn general: we could be funnier and more surreal! Funny + sharp. Could use some edge. \"We cannot be funny with software right now\"\nDatabases of populations (El Salvadoreans about to be deported, India's biometric database being sold to journalists etc)\nEmergency ... games of words. Needs some push.\nContinuous integration missing from html?\n\nhttps://pad.constantvzw.org/p/observatory.guide.introduction\nTension in the introduction. First: critical distance, then entanglement. Need to name it/connect it. Helps to tie in the quote?\nLater: \"going beyond\" ... MMo -- need to reformulate. Make quote (why it is there) more xplicit.\nDistance can be critical but not always. \n\n\nWork a bit more on the introduction, this can work on its own?\nSo the text should be a text to be read that stands on its own and does work on its own. \nMaybe the introduction needs to be more explicitly political.\n\nSeda looked for methods -- there are some missing. Christoph will make them appear!\nAlso: if we open to others, they will bring new energy.\nCalendar App Collapsing!\nPeggy: we can do this on the 9th? Or maybe not. \nSeda: separate time for sharpening the introduction, to keep serioussnes and humor together.\n\nCluster descriptions not done yet/not in the html. Should we write them or use quotes?\nSome Humor Can Go Here.\nNeeds writing -- we tried using quotes only, but it does not work for all.\n\nhttp://pad.constantvzw.org/p/observatory.guide.grouping.temporality\nhttp://pad.constantvzw.org/p/observatory.guide.grouping.languaging\nillustrations to open the groupings\nWorks well with the design! So, make mixes of images/quotes and some writing.\nCarlin: it does not need to be a lot ... one or two words. Titles already do a lot.\n\nAppendix\nPeggy has done the interview and will do the transciption by next week\nMeeting was very nice! New stories added. Anecdotes.\n(CH: what about the interview, where/how to put it?)\nLet's just put it into the https://pad.constantvzw.org/p/observatory.guide.jean.heuns pad\ndon't mind the formatting right now.\nAn hour of conversation. Keeping all of it? An excerpt? Use extracts through the quide.\nDecide on the 9th of February 2018 ?\nPeggy will do the transcription anyways. CH + FS think it could work well, different pace.\n\nWhat other extra materials could go in an Appendix?\nthe full interview Peggy did\nJogi's email\nWhat else?\nHans text on time: wanted to work on the text -- finished by 9th of February\nAnita: wrote on punchcards, needs to be finished ... a short version would be nice!!\n\nChristoph advanced on processing the pads:\nChristoph is \"pretty fine\"\n\ndifferent parts, different treatments.

In the mean time, Anita, Martino, Carlin, Peggy, Seda, Michael, Femke have been joined by Christoph to work on The Guide To Techno-Galactic Software Observation.\n\nWe have been trying to put together a collection that works both as a documentation of the session and as a /new/ publication. As part of this we have created a list of methods for software observation that are drawn from the worksession documentation. We chose to show the materials in terms of methods for observation, hoping this loose frame can welcome irony and bending.\nWhile we are trying to reach some density and coherence, the guide does not aim for completeness. Rather we hope to give an impression of the variety of tones and materials that were manifested during our 6 days together. Now that there is some basic structure for the guide, we would like to invite you, our fellow observers, to add materials and/or add methods you feel must be in THE guide to techno-galactic software observation!\n\nHere is a first pdf: [LINK HERE]. \nYou can find the live index to all methods so far: \n    http://pad.constantvzw.org/p/observatory.guide\n    There is some markup added for generating the guide directly from pads, obviously. A few of the things missing from this pdf: A transcription from an interview with Jean Huens (Peggy), Hans' text on time, Anita contribution on punchcards. And a thousand other small things.\n\nYou are welcome to update/complete/correct existing items or to add new ones. Some examples of more or less 'complete' methods that you can copy from: \n    https://pad.constantvzw.org/p/observatory.guide.agile.yoga , \n    https://pad.constantvzw.org/p/observatory.guide.somethinginthemiddlemaybe , \n    https://pad.constantvzw.org/p/observatory.guide.visit , \n    https://pad.constantvzw.org/p/observatory.guide.monopsychism\n\nStyle guide below!\n\nIf you would like to make use of the notes from the worksession, you can find the pages indexed here: \n    http://observatory.constantvzw.org/etherdump/_new_index.html\n\nWe have only a short window of time to put this together so that we can meet the publication deadline.

Testing this testbed at a local Constant workshop led to the meta-project of testing software meant for testing software. \n*How: The interwebs hosts many projects that aim to produce software for observing software, (from now on Software With Observatory Ambitions (SWOA)). A comparative methodology can be produced by using different SWOA to observe software of interest. Example: use different sniffing software to observe wireless networks. Doing so reveals what is seen as worthy of observation (e.g., what protocols, what space, which devices), the granularity of the observation (e.g., how is the observation captured, in what detail), the logo and conceptual framework of choice etc. \n*Where/when/situation?: Ideally, SWOA can be used everywhere. In reality, institutions, laws and administrators like to control the use of SWOA on infrastructures not also run by the people running it. Hence, we get distinctions like researchers and pen testers (e.g., they were hired) vs. hackers. \n*What: Deep philosophical moment: most software has a recursive observatory ambition (it wants to be observed in its execution, output etc.). Debuggers, logs, dashboards are all instances of software with observatory ambitions and can not be separated from software itself. So, what separates SWOA from software itself? HELP! \n*Who/with: If you can run the SWOA (many of these are promises more than running software/available code), you can do it. The question is: will people like it if you observe their SWOA?\n*Why/urgency/ [this is maybe related to the engagement question?]: If critical engagement in software is a thing, it follows that people would develop software to observe. \n*Note: [anything that did not fit above.]\n*WARNING: \n*REMEMBER: Good SWOA software usually uses an animal as a logo.:D\n*See also: making a bestiary of visual cultures/logos around it\n\n*Method: Rearranging space as conditioning observations (WTC vs. Museum vs. University vs. Startup Office vs. Shifting Walls that became Water Fountains)\n*By: [who developed, tested, proposed this method]\n*How: [ideas for how the observation method can be applied]\n*Where/when: [in what situation, space, circumstances does the observation take place]\n*What: [what/who gets observed.

Namur and Leuven), conduct interviews (ie. with Jean Heuns but also as Relational software observatory consultancy service), organize and hold a worksession (ie. what we did), listen to an expert (ie.

Editing glossary.\nQuestion: what about this warning:\nhttp://pad.constantvzw.org/p/observatory.guide.warning -- it is a meta-warning that should go first? (now under the essentials)\nShe Does Not Feel Lost.\nWhat scale of conversation? Intro could do with some tweaking, but in general works.\nRead through half of the methods. Feels familiar. Need to hand it to interested people that were not at the workshop.\nSend this to people that were at TGSO first.\nLikes the mix: Conversational and some more 'technical'.\n\nSeda also had a look -- some things to add and remove ... introduction (stops with freelancer-utopia, but what about turkers, clickworkers, on-line task workers ...)\nMight need something on services in the clinic description. Some humor!\nIn general: we could be funnier and more surreal! Funny + sharp. Could use some edge. \"We cannot be funny with software right now\"\nDatabases of populations (El Salvadoreans about to be deported, India's biometric database being sold to journalists etc)\nEmergency ... games of words. Needs some push.\nContinuous integration missing from html?\n\nhttps://pad.constantvzw.org/p/observatory.guide.introduction\nTension in the introduction. First: critical distance, then entanglement. Need to name it/connect it. Helps to tie in the quote?\nLater: \"going beyond\" ... MMo -- need to reformulate. Make quote (why it is there) more xplicit.\nDistance can be critical but not always. \n\n\nWork a bit more on the introduction, this can work on its own?\nSo the text should be a text to be read that stands on its own and does work on its own. \nMaybe the introduction needs to be more explicitly political.\n\nSeda looked for methods -- there are some missing. Christoph will make them appear!\nAlso: if we open to others, they will bring new energy.\nCalendar App Collapsing!\nPeggy: we can do this on the 9th? Or maybe not. \nSeda: separate time for sharpening the introduction, to keep serioussnes and humor together.\n\nCluster descriptions not done yet/not in the html. Should we write them or use quotes?\nSome Humor Can Go Here.\nNeeds writing -- we tried using quotes only, but it does not work for all.\n\nhttp://pad.constantvzw.org/p/observatory.guide.grouping.temporality\nhttp://pad.constantvzw.org/p/observatory.guide.grouping.languaging\nillustrations to open the groupings\nWorks well with the design!

Titles already do a lot.\n\nAppendix\nPeggy has done the interview and will do the transciption by next week\nMeeting was very nice! New stories added. Anecdotes.\n(CH: what about the interview, where/how to put it?)\nLet's just put it into the https://pad.constantvzw.org/p/observatory.guide.jean.heuns pad\ndon't mind the formatting right now.\nAn hour of conversation. Keeping all of it? An excerpt? Use extracts through the quide.\nDecide on the 9th of February 2018 ?\nPeggy will do the transcription anyways. CH + FS think it could work well, different pace.\n\nWhat other extra materials could go in an Appendix?\nthe full interview Peggy did\nJogi's email\nWhat else?\nHans text on time: wanted to work on the text -- finished by 9th of February\nAnita: wrote on punchcards, needs to be finished ... a short version would be nice!!\n\nChristoph advanced on processing the pads:\nChristoph is \"pretty fine\"\n\ndifferent parts, different treatments.

In the mean time, Anita, Martino, Carlin, Peggy, Seda, Michael, Femke have been joined by Christoph to work on The Guide To Techno-Galactic Software Observation.\n\nWe have been trying to put together a collection that works both as a documentation of the session and as a /new/ publication. As part of this we have created a list of methods for software observation that are drawn from the worksession documentation. We chose to show the materials in terms of methods for observation, hoping this loose frame can welcome irony and bending.\nWhile we are trying to reach some density and coherence, the guide does not aim for completeness. Rather we hope to give an impression of the variety of tones and materials that were manifested during our 6 days together. Now that there is some basic structure for the guide, we would like to invite you, our fellow observers, to add materials and/or add methods you feel must be in THE guide to techno-galactic software observation!\n\nHere is a first pdf: [LINK HERE]. \nYou can find the live index to all methods so far: \n    http://pad.constantvzw.org/p/observatory.guide\n    There is some markup added for generating the guide directly from pads, obviously. A few of the things missing from this pdf: A transcription from an interview with Jean Huens (Peggy), Hans' text on time, Anita contribution on punchcards. And a thousand other small things.\n\nYou are welcome to update/complete/correct existing items or to add new ones. Some examples of more or less 'complete' methods that you can copy from: \n    https://pad.constantvzw.org/p/observatory.guide.agile.yoga , \n    https://pad.constantvzw.org/p/observatory.guide.somethinginthemiddlemaybe , \n    https://pad.constantvzw.org/p/observatory.guide.visit , \n    https://pad.constantvzw.org/p/observatory.guide.monopsychism\n\nStyle guide below!\n\nIf you would like to make use of the notes from the worksession, you can find the pages indexed here: \n    http://observatory.constantvzw.org/etherdump/_new_index.html\n\nWe have only a short window of time to put this together so that we can meet the publication deadline. The deadline for your contributions is January 29\n\nIf you want to commit to a contribution, or have questions, or comments, please send an e-mail to the mailinglist [observatory@lists.constantvzw.org] in the coming days so we can all coordinate.\n\n\n----\n\nThe Techno-Galactic Software Observation Guide uses an extended dialect of markdown.\nNext to classic markdown ( https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown ) you can\nwrite `instruction lines` that tell the translator about the desired output.\nAn `instruction line` starts with '%' and takes everything after the first colon\nas input e.g.\n\n% SUPERLARGETEXT: Something all should know\n\nwill insert 'Something all should know' using whatever is considered a superlarge textsize.\n\n\nCURRENT INSTRCUTIONS\n--------------------\n\n% METHOD:\n% ABOUT:\n% BY:\n% EXAMPLE:\n% HOW:\n% NOTE:\n% REMEMBER\n% SEEALSO:\n% RELATESTO:\n% SOURCE:\n% URGENCY\n% WARNING\n% WHAT\n% WHEN\n% WHO\n% WHY\n\n\nFUTURE INSTRUCTIONS\n-------------------\n\nThe markup vocabulary is meant to develop during the editing process.\n\n\n\n\n\n----\n\n\n\n\n\nLAST ROUNDS 2 DECEMBER\n\nPlanning\n\nBefore January 9:\n- Finish descriptions of clusters (Martino? + Femke?) NOT DONE\n- Finish introduction (Done for now? Maybe another round on Feb. 9?) DONE\n- Interview Jean Huens + transcription (Peggy) interview DONE, transcription next week Wed\n- Establish a level of editing that shows a balance between documentation and guidance (all of us try to finish the entries we took on)\n- Finish pdf to a point that no content is missing and we can start discussing design (Christoph) DONE!\n\nMeet January 9, 20h CET (1.5 hr meeting max)\n- See what still needs to be done\n- Send out e-mail to TGSO list: deadline 29 January\n\n[Carlin starts editing]\n\n9 February 12h CET: we meet to finish whatever needs to be done \nCarlin joins at 16h CET\n\nEnd February: print\nMain pads:\nhttp://pad.constantvzw.org/p/observatory.methods\nhttp://pad.constantvzw.org/p/observatory.guide\n\n---\n\nCarlin's questions\n- editing process\n*- different approach for primary materials (taken from workshop) vs framing materials created now\n*- in order to respect the documentation of the primary material (michael)\n*- how can this be a document that oscillates between \"look what cool methods we used and \"here are some things you could try out yourself\"\n\"If you are writing, you have liberties\" - if necessary, ask people who were involved in the thing to \n- order of entries\nhttp://pad.constantvzw.org/p/observatory.guide\n- incorporation of photographs, diagrams, etc\nYES!\n- small note (visit computer collections appears twice in the current html)\n(probably ok now?)\n\nlook for phrases / ways for introducing the chapters/groupings. Could be just a line? A task for someone?\nTest: http://pad.constantvzw.org/p/observatory.guide.grouping.temporality\n\nIntroduction http://pad.constantvzw.org/p/observatory.guide.introduction Peggy + FS + Seda first round\n\nAdd reference to the walk-in clinic? A description. Unlike normal guides: we have not removed the process.

Testing this testbed at a local Constant workshop led to the meta-project of testing software meant for testing software. \n*How: The interwebs hosts many projects that aim to produce software for observing software, (from now on Software With Observatory Ambitions (SWOA)). A comparative methodology can be produced by using different SWOA to observe software of interest. Example: use different sniffing software to observe wireless networks. Doing so reveals what is seen as worthy of observation (e.g., what protocols, what space, which devices), the granularity of the observation (e.g., how is the observation captured, in what detail), the logo and conceptual framework of choice etc. \n*Where/when/situation?: Ideally, SWOA can be used everywhere. In reality, institutions, laws and administrators like to control the use of SWOA on infrastructures not also run by the people running it. Hence, we get distinctions like researchers and pen testers (e.g., they were hired) vs. hackers. \n*What: Deep philosophical moment: most software has a recursive observatory ambition (it wants to be observed in its execution, output etc.). Debuggers, logs, dashboards are all instances of software with observatory ambitions and can not be separated from software itself. So, what separates SWOA from software itself? HELP! \n*Who/with: If you can run the SWOA (many of these are promises more than running software/available code), you can do it. The question is: will people like it if you observe their SWOA?\n*Why/urgency/ [this is maybe related to the engagement question?]: If critical engagement in software is a thing, it follows that people would develop software to observe. \n*Note: [anything that did not fit above.]\n*WARNING: \n*REMEMBER: Good SWOA software usually uses an animal as a logo.:D\n*See also: making a bestiary of visual cultures/logos around it\n\n*Method: Rearranging space as conditioning observations (WTC vs. Museum vs. University vs. Startup Office vs. Shifting Walls that became Water Fountains)\n*By: [who developed, tested, proposed this method]\n*How: [ideas for how the observation method can be applied]\n*Where/when: [in what situation, space, circumstances does the observation take place]\n*What: [what/who gets observed.

Namur and Leuven), conduct interviews (ie. with Jean Heuns but also as Relational software observatory consultancy service), organize and hold a worksession (ie. what we did), listen to an expert (ie.

see if they can do something for the intro (Femke maybe joins/looks over [will do!])\nAnita sends editors a proposal for punchcards, afterwards add on-line\nMartino + Femke + Anita (rescue, also): intros, 14h CET 31/01\nMartino re-ask Hans\nAll: go through methods we started/adopted\n[Carlin rereads Peggy's transcription]\n\n--\n\nAgenda for tonight meeting: \nTHE INTERNATIONAL MEETING\n- See what still needs to be done\n- Send out e-mail to TGSO list: deadline 29 January\n\nMeet here at 20h CET https://meet.jit.si/observatory\n\nEditing\nCarlin has been reading, working on some items. Editing glossary.\nQuestion: what about this warning:\nhttp://pad.constantvzw.org/p/observatory.guide.warning -- it is a meta-warning that should go first? (now under the essentials)\nShe Does Not Feel Lost.\nWhat scale of conversation? Intro could do with some tweaking, but in general works.\nRead through half of the methods. Feels familiar.

In the mean time, Anita, Martino, Carlin, Peggy, Seda, Michael, Femke have been joined by Christoph to work on The Guide To Techno-Galactic Software Observation.\n\nWe have been trying to put together a collection that works both as a documentation of the session and as a /new/ publication. As part of this we have created a list of methods for software observation that are drawn from the worksession documentation. We chose to show the materials in terms of methods for observation, hoping this loose frame can welcome irony and bending.\nWhile we are trying to reach some density and coherence, the guide does not aim for completeness. Rather we hope to give an impression of the variety of tones and materials that were manifested during our 6 days together. Now that there is some basic structure for the guide, we would like to invite you, our fellow observers, to add materials and/or add methods you feel must be in THE guide to techno-galactic software observation!\n\nHere is a first pdf: [LINK HERE]. \nYou can find the live index to all methods so far: \n    http://pad.constantvzw.org/p/observatory.guide\n    There is some markup added for generating the guide directly from pads, obviously. A few of the things missing from this pdf: A transcription from an interview with Jean Huens (Peggy), Hans' text on time, Anita contribution on punchcards. And a thousand other small things.\n\nYou are welcome to update/complete/correct existing items or to add new ones. Some examples of more or less 'complete' methods that you can copy from: \n    https://pad.constantvzw.org/p/observatory.guide.agile.yoga , \n    https://pad.constantvzw.org/p/observatory.guide.somethinginthemiddlemaybe , \n    https://pad.constantvzw.org/p/observatory.guide.visit , \n    https://pad.constantvzw.org/p/observatory.guide.monopsychism\n\nStyle guide below!\n\nIf you would like to make use of the notes from the worksession, you can find the pages indexed here: \n    http://observatory.constantvzw.org/etherdump/_new_index.html\n\nWe have only a short window of time to put this together so that we can meet the publication deadline. The deadline for your contributions is January 29\n\nIf you want to commit to a contribution, or have questions, or comments, please send an e-mail to the mailinglist [observatory@lists.constantvzw.org] in the coming days so we can all coordinate.\n\n\n----\n\nThe Techno-Galactic Software Observation Guide uses an extended dialect of markdown.\nNext to classic markdown ( https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown ) you can\nwrite `instruction lines` that tell the translator about the desired output.\nAn `instruction line` starts with '%' and takes everything after the first colon\nas input e.g.\n\n% SUPERLARGETEXT: Something all should know\n\nwill insert 'Something all should know' using whatever is considered a superlarge textsize.\n\n\nCURRENT INSTRUCTIONS\n====================\n\n% METHOD:\n\nThe main description\n\n% SEHERE:\n% SEEALSO:\n\nUsed for the main structure.\n% SEEHERE will directly include a document.\n\n% ABOUT:\n% BY:\n% EXAMPLE:\n% HOW:\n% NOTE:\n% REMEMBER\n% RELATESTO:\n% SOURCE:\n% URGENCY:\n% WARNING:\n% WHAT:\n% WHEN:\n% WHO:\n% WHY:\n\n\nFUTURE INSTRUCTIONS\n-------------------\n\nThe markup vocabulary is meant to develop during the editing process.\n\n\n\n\n\n----\n\n\n\n\n\nLAST ROUNDS 2 DECEMBER\n\nPlanning\n\nBefore January 9:\n- Finish descriptions of clusters (Martino? + Femke?)

Testing this testbed at a local Constant workshop led to the meta-project of testing software meant for testing software. \n*How: The interwebs hosts many projects that aim to produce software for observing software, (from now on Software With Observatory Ambitions (SWOA)). A comparative methodology can be produced by using different SWOA to observe software of interest. Example: use different sniffing software to observe wireless networks. Doing so reveals what is seen as worthy of observation (e.g., what protocols, what space, which devices), the granularity of the observation (e.g., how is the observation captured, in what detail), the logo and conceptual framework of choice etc. \n*Where/when/situation?: Ideally, SWOA can be used everywhere. In reality, institutions, laws and administrators like to control the use of SWOA on infrastructures not also run by the people running it. Hence, we get distinctions like researchers and pen testers (e.g., they were hired) vs. hackers. \n*What: Deep philosophical moment: most software has a recursive observatory ambition (it wants to be observed in its execution, output etc.). Debuggers, logs, dashboards are all instances of software with observatory ambitions and can not be separated from software itself. So, what separates SWOA from software itself? HELP! \n*Who/with: If you can run the SWOA (many of these are promises more than running software/available code), you can do it. The question is: will people like it if you observe their SWOA?\n*Why/urgency/ [this is maybe related to the engagement question?]: If critical engagement in software is a thing, it follows that people would develop software to observe. \n*Note: [anything that did not fit above.]\n*WARNING: \n*REMEMBER: Good SWOA software usually uses an animal as a logo.:D\n*See also: making a bestiary of visual cultures/logos around it\n\n*Method: Rearranging space as conditioning observations (WTC vs. Museum vs. University vs. Startup Office vs. Shifting Walls that became Water Fountains)\n*By: [who developed, tested, proposed this method]\n*How: [ideas for how the observation method can be applied]\n*Where/when: [in what situation, space, circumstances does the observation take place]\n*What: [what/who gets observed.

In the mean time, Anita, Martino, Carlin, Peggy, Seda, Michael, Femke have been joined by Christoph to work on The Guide To Techno-Galactic Software Observation.\n\nWe have been trying to put together a collection that works both as a documentation of the session and as a /new/ publication. As part of this we have created a list of methods for software observation that are drawn from the worksession documentation. We chose to show the materials in terms of methods for observation, hoping this loose frame can welcome irony and bending.\nWhile we are trying to reach some density and coherence, the guide does not aim for completeness. Rather we hope to give an impression of the variety of tones and materials that were manifested during our 6 days together. Now that there is some basic structure for the guide, we would like to invite you, our fellow observers, to add materials and/or add methods you feel must be in THE guide to techno-galactic software observation!\n\nHere is a first pdf: [LINK HERE]. \nYou can find the live index to all methods so far: \n    http://pad.constantvzw.org/p/observatory.guide\n    There is some markup added for generating the guide directly from pads, obviously. A few of the things missing from this pdf: A transcription from an interview with Jean Huens (Peggy), Hans' text on time, Anita contribution on punchcards. And a thousand other small things.\n\nYou are welcome to update/complete/correct existing items or to add new ones. Some examples of more or less 'complete' methods that you can copy from: \n    https://pad.constantvzw.org/p/observatory.guide.agile.yoga , \n    https://pad.constantvzw.org/p/observatory.guide.somethinginthemiddlemaybe , \n    https://pad.constantvzw.org/p/observatory.guide.visit , \n    https://pad.constantvzw.org/p/observatory.guide.monopsychism\n\nStyle guide below!\n\nIf you would like to make use of the notes from the worksession, you can find the pages indexed here: \n    http://observatory.constantvzw.org/etherdump/_new_index.html\n\nWe have only a short window of time to put this together so that we can meet the publication deadline. The deadline for your contributions is January 29\n\nIf you want to commit to a contribution, or have questions, or comments, please send an e-mail to the mailinglist [observatory@lists.constantvzw.org] in the coming days so we can all coordinate.\n\n\n----\n\nThe Techno-Galactic Software Observation Guide uses an extended dialect of markdown.\nNext to classic markdown ( https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown ) you can\nwrite `instruction lines` that tell the translator about the desired output.\nAn `instruction line` starts with '%' and takes everything after the first colon\nas input e.g.\n\n% SUPERLARGETEXT: Something all should know\n\nwill insert 'Something all should know' using whatever is considered a superlarge textsize.\n\n\nCURRENT INSTRUCTIONS\n====================\n\n% METHOD:\n\nThis is main description of the software observation method\n\n% WHAT:\n% WHEN:\n% WHO:\n% WHY:\n% HOW:\n% URGENCY:\n% WARNING:\n% REMEMBER:\n% NOTE:\n% EXAMPLE:\n% RELATESTO:\n\n% SEEHERE:\n% SEEALSO:\n\nUsed for adding methods to the index.\n% SEEHERE will directly include a document.\n% SEEALSO will put a reference.\n\n\n\n\nFUTURE INSTRUCTIONS\n-------------------\n\nThe markup vocabulary is meant to develop during the editing process.\n\n\n\n\n\n----\n\n\n\n\n\nLAST ROUNDS 2 DECEMBER\n\nPlanning\n\nBefore January 9:\n- Finish descriptions of clusters (Martino? + Femke?) NOT DONE\n- Finish introduction (Done for now? Maybe another round on Feb. 9?) DONE\n- Interview Jean Huens + transcription (Peggy) interview DONE, transcription next week Wed\n- Establish a level of editing that shows a balance between documentation and guidance (all of us try to finish the entries we took on)\n- Finish pdf to a point that no content is missing and we can start discussing design (Christoph) DONE!\n\nMeet January 9, 20h CET (1.5 hr meeting max)\n- See what still needs to be done\n- Send out e-mail to TGSO list: deadline 29 January\n\n[Carlin starts editing]\n\n9 February 12h CET: we meet to finish whatever needs to be done \nCarlin joins at 16h CET\n\nEnd February: print\nMain pads:\nhttp://pad.constantvzw.org/p/observatory.methods\nhttp://pad.constantvzw.org/p/observatory.guide\n\n---\n\nCarlin's questions\n- editing process\n*- different approach for primary materials (taken from workshop) vs framing materials created now\n*- in order to respect the documentation of the primary material (michael)\n*- how can this be a document that oscillates between \"look what cool methods we used and \"here are some things you could try out yourself\"\n\"If you are writing, you have liberties\" - if necessary, ask people who were involved in the thing to \n- order of entries\nhttp://pad.constantvzw.org/p/observatory.guide\n- incorporation of photographs, diagrams, etc\nYES!\n- small note (visit computer collections appears twice in the current html)\n(probably ok now?)\n\nlook for phrases / ways for introducing the chapters/groupings. Could be just a line? A task for someone?\nTest: http://pad.constantvzw.org/p/observatory.guide.grouping.temporality\n\nIntroduction http://pad.constantvzw.org/p/observatory.guide.introduction Peggy + FS + Seda first round\n\nAdd reference to the walk-in clinic? A description. Unlike normal guides: we have not removed the process. WARNING: there will be a mix of abstractions and concrete experiences.\n\nCarlin works on 3 entries\n\nThe interview needs to be done -> Peggy\n\nHans e-mail -> Martino\nAna + Ricardo -> Femke\n\nFor each of the chapter descriptions: quote from the materials/reader? Could be an image. Or a short inspirational phrase? -> Martino tries\nhttp://pad.constantvzw.org/p/observatory.guide\n\nAn email to other TGSO participants, call for help/see if further material is available (once the PDF is more stable)\n\nWARNING: pad fatigue might occur\n\nlatex todo:\n* be able to force empty new lines  (f.ex to put back lines in scrollresistance)\n* differentiate code quotes from pad quotes\n\n\n\n\n\nSAS Survival Handbook: The Ultimate Guide to Surviving Anywhere \nhttps://archive.org/stream/SASSurvivalHandbookTheUltimateGuideToSurvivingAnywhere/AppNee.com.SAS.Survival.Handbook.2nd.Edition#page/n359/mode/2up\nThe  Rudiments Of Wisdom encyclopaedia by Tim Hunkin.\nhttp://www.rudimentsofwisdom.com\n\nissue: different materials. works well to situate the week. fr an interview, a good way to introduce. but with folders, code ... so brought the SAS guide.

The difference between documentation and publication is the imagined audience\ndocumentation: audience is the participants, does not have the ambition to be legible to non-participants\npublication: a broader audience (with contributions from other participants but not from those who did not participate in the work session) who would be able to pick it up and understand the techno-galactic condition\n\n\nCan we decide on a few kinds of formats and test them\n- one can be a breakdown like on the methods list\n- one can be more just description/summary/exericse\n\nwe look at the methods\nand other forms of documentation\nsee if the proposed structure works\nspecifically:\n*test: make a round of groupings / hierarchies affinities\n*test: make more methods\n*test: other templates\n*\n7:20 CET back to discuss\n\nPeggy:\n\nFor the interview ... something that could be easily done, short bio interview with 2-3 q to the participants. Easy to do, and a bit is already done in the introductions. Would be good to have it in the guide for people that have not been involved. Carlin likes this too!\nP. still likes to do long interview with mr. Huens.\nWould like to write down the visit to the museum as an 19th century explorer .\n\nMartino: groupings can certainly work.

If the object is produced by the mode of observation. or what if the mode of observation is produced by the object ...\nAre we producing a guide that we want to exist or producing a document of what happened (a bit of both?)\nName the things that we might otherwise take for granted.\nHow do we name what's different about software and observation across time, without rendering the new or the old into an ideal?\nA quite litteral, chronological list: based on the week, based on the observations of/that were experimented with the week\n*we follow the methods of observation day by day, session by session and list them. \n*follow the program, but all the different things that started to happen.\n*Trying to stay chronological so we force ourselves to consider the different experiments/methods that happened.\n\n[[warning: \"our methods for observation, like mapping, come with their luggage.\" from Thursday afternoon section of http://observatory.constantvzw.org/etherdump/toc.md.diff.html ]]\n[[warning: some of these methods are not suitable for agile software/SaaS observation]]\n\nTEMPLATE FOR DESCRIBING PROPOSED METHODS:\n*By: [who developed, tested, proposed this method]\n*How: [ideas for how the observation method can be applied]\n*Where/when: [in what situation, space, circumstances does the observation take place]\n*What: [what/who gets observed.

What software category does it apply to agile/SaaS?]\n*Who: [who/what gets to observe]\n*Why: [what is the engagement, of the observer with the observed and vice versa]\n*Note: [anything that did not fit above.]\n\n*Method: Testing the testbed: testing software with observatory ambitions (SWOA)\n*By/history/source/origin/process: the \"original testbed\" was proposed by researchers/collaborators in Princeton. Testing this testbed at a local Constant workshop led to the meta-project of testing software meant for testing software. \n*How: The interwebs hosts many projects that aim to produce software for observing software, (from now on Software With Observatory Ambitions (SWOA)). A comparative methodology can be produced by using different SWOA to observe software of interest. Example: use different sniffing software to observe wireless networks. Doing so reveals what is seen as worthy of observation (e.g., what protocols, what space, which devices), the granularity of the observation (e.g., how is the observation captured, in what detail), the logo and conceptual framework of choice etc. \n*Where/when/situation?: Ideally, SWOA can be used everywhere. In reality, institutions, laws and administrators like to control the use of SWOA on infrastructures not also run by the people running it. Hence, we get distinctions like researchers and pen testers (e.g., they were hired) vs. hackers. \n*What: Deep philosophical moment: most software has a recursive observatory ambition (it wants to be observed in its execution, output etc.). Debuggers, logs, dashboards are all instances of software with observatory ambitions and can not be separated from software itself. So, what separates SWOA from software itself? HELP! \n*Who/with: If you can run the SWOA (many of these are promises more than running software/available code), you can do it. The question is: will people like it if you observe their SWOA?\n*Why/urgency/ [this is maybe related to the engagement question?]: If critical engagement in software is a thing, it follows that people would develop software to observe. \n*Note: [anything that did not fit above.]\n*WARNING: \n*REMEMBER: Good SWOA software usually uses an animal as a logo.:D\n*See also: making a bestiary of visual cultures/logos around it\n\n*Method: Rearranging space as conditioning observations (WTC vs. Museum vs. University vs. Startup Office vs. Shifting Walls that became Water Fountains)\n*By: [who developed, tested, proposed this method]\n*How: [ideas for how the observation method can be applied]\n*Where/when: [in what situation, space, circumstances does the observation take place]\n*What: [what/who gets observed.

One way to handle the publication/documentation tension would be to structure a publication around a set of ways of knowing/methods and then select and shape documentation from the worksession as samples of these methods or taking moments from the workshop as prompts for reflection on these methods. Some of the play would come in from the mix of recognizable and common methods (visit a museum (ie. Namur and Leuven), conduct interviews (ie. with Jean Heuns but also as Relational software observatory consultancy service), organize and hold a worksession (ie. what we did), listen to an expert (ie. sidechannel)) with the less common ones (ie. create a bestiary of software logos, engaging with code through collective reading/performance, etc). \n\n\n\n\nChapters/sections\n\n-possible

what still needs to be done\n- Send out e-mail to TGSO list: deadline 29 January\n\nMeet here at 20h CET https://meet.jit.si/observatory\n\nEditing\nCarlin has been reading, working on some items. Editing glossary.\nQuestion: what about this warning:\nhttp://pad.constantvzw.org/p/observatory.guide.warning -- it is a meta-warning that should go first? (now under the essentials)\nShe Does Not Feel Lost.\nWhat scale of conversation? Intro could do with some tweaking, but in general works.\nRead through half of the methods. Feels familiar. Need to hand it to interested people that were not at the workshop.\nSend this to people that were at TGSO first.\nLikes the mix: Conversational and some more 'technical'.\n\nSeda also had a look -- some things to add and remove ... introduction (stops with freelancer-utopia, but what about turkers, clickworkers, on-line task workers ...)\nMight need something on services in the clinic description. Some humor!\nIn general: we could be funnier and more surreal! Funny + sharp. Could use some edge. \"We cannot be funny with software right now\"\nDatabases of populations (El Salvadoreans about to be deported, India's biometric database being sold to journalists etc)\nEmergency ... games of words. Needs some push.\nContinuous integration missing from html?\n\nhttps://pad.constantvzw.org/p/observatory.guide.introduction\nTension in the introduction. First: critical distance, then entanglement. Need to name it/connect it. Helps to tie in the quote?\nLater: \"going beyond\" ... MMo -- need to reformulate. Make quote (why it is there) more xplicit.\nDistance can be critical but not always. \n\n\nWork a bit more on the introduction, this can work on its own?\nSo the text should be a text to be read that stands on its own and does work on its own. \nMaybe the introduction needs to be more explicitly political.\n\nSeda looked for methods -- there are some missing. Christoph will make them appear!\nAlso: if we open to others, they will bring new energy.\nCalendar App Collapsing!\nPeggy: we can do this on the 9th? Or maybe not. \nSeda: separate time for sharpening the introduction, to keep serioussnes and humor together.\n\nCluster descriptions not done yet/not in the html. Should we write them or use quotes?\nSome Humor Can Go Here.\nNeeds writing -- we tried using quotes only, but it does not work for all.\n\nhttp://pad.constantvzw.org/p/observatory.guide.grouping.temporality\nhttp://pad.constantvzw.org/p/observatory.guide.grouping.languaging\nillustrations to open the groupings\nWorks well with the design! So, make mixes of images/quotes and some writing.\nCarlin: it does not need to be a lot ... one or two words. Titles already do a lot.\n\nAppendix\nPeggy has done the interview and will do the transciption by next week\nMeeting was very nice! New stories added. Anecdotes.\n(CH: what about the interview, where/how to put it?)\nLet's just put it into the https://pad.constantvzw.org/p/observatory.guide.jean.heuns pad\ndon't mind the formatting right now.\nAn hour of conversation. Keeping all of it? An excerpt? Use extracts through the quide.\nDecide on the 9th of February 2018 ?\nPeggy will do the transcription anyways. CH + FS think it could work well, different pace.\n\nWhat other extra materials could go in an Appendix?\nthe full interview Peggy did\nJogi's email\nWhat else?\nHans text on time: wanted to work on the text -- finished by 9th of February\nAnita: wrote on punchcards, needs to be finished ... a short version would be nice!!\n\nChristoph advanced on processing the pads:\nChristoph is \"pretty fine\"\n\ndifferent parts, different treatments.

To keep track of things to be done I added a temporary '% TODO:' \n\nFYI: http://gitlab.constantvzw.org/ch/observatory.guide\n\nTech question: intake form ... could we link it, how does it work? How to integrate documents (like pdfs)?\nwrite in your pad ...\n% TODO: include pdf here linktothepdf\nand CH will look :-)\n\nIncluding other TGSO people: an email!\n- specific questions\n- general call\n- make little howto (until next week?)\n- make a back-up of the current version before the email goes out to the larger group\n\nSubject: Call for contributions TGSO guide (deadline 29/1)\n\nDear all,\n\nIt has been a while since we ended the Walk-in clinic with agile yoga! In the mean time, Anita, Martino, Carlin, Peggy, Seda, Michael, Femke have been joined by Christoph to work on The Guide To Techno-Galactic Software Observation.\n\nWe have been trying to put together a collection that works both as a documentation of the session and as a /new/ publication. As part of this we have created a list of methods for software observation that are drawn from the worksession documentation. We chose to show the materials in terms of methods for observation, hoping this loose frame can welcome irony and bending.\nWhile we are trying to reach some density and coherence, the guide does not aim for completeness. Rather we hope to give an impression of the variety of tones and materials that were manifested during our 6 days together. Now that there is some basic structure for the guide, we would like to invite you, our fellow observers, to add materials and/or add methods you feel must be in THE guide to techno-galactic software observation!\n\nHere is a first pdf: [LINK HERE]. \nYou can find the live index to all methods so far: \n    http://pad.constantvzw.org/p/observatory.guide\n    There is some markup added for generating the guide directly from pads, obviously. A few of the things missing from this pdf: A transcription from an interview with Jean Huens (Peggy), Hans' text on time, Anita contribution on punchcards.

Testing this testbed at a local Constant workshop led to the meta-project of testing software meant for testing software. \n*How: The interwebs hosts many projects that aim to produce software for observing software, (from now on Software With Observatory Ambitions (SWOA)). A comparative methodology can be produced by using different SWOA to observe software of interest. Example: use different sniffing software to observe wireless networks. Doing so reveals what is seen as worthy of observation (e.g., what protocols, what space, which devices), the granularity of the observation (e.g., how is the observation captured, in what detail), the logo and conceptual framework of choice etc. \n*Where/when/situation?: Ideally, SWOA can be used everywhere. In reality, institutions, laws and administrators like to control the use of SWOA on infrastructures not also run by the people running it. Hence, we get distinctions like researchers and pen testers (e.g., they were hired) vs. hackers. \n*What: Deep philosophical moment: most software has a recursive observatory ambition (it wants to be observed in its execution, output etc.). Debuggers, logs, dashboards are all instances of software with observatory ambitions and can not be separated from software itself. So, what separates SWOA from software itself? HELP! \n*Who/with: If you can run the SWOA (many of these are promises more than running software/available code), you can do it. The question is: will people like it if you observe their SWOA?\n*Why/urgency/ [this is maybe related to the engagement question?]: If critical engagement in software is a thing, it follows that people would develop software to observe. \n*Note: [anything that did not fit above.]\n*WARNING: \n*REMEMBER: Good SWOA software usually uses an animal as a logo.:D\n*See also: making a bestiary of visual cultures/logos around it\n\n*Method: Rearranging space as conditioning observations (WTC vs. Museum vs. University vs. Startup Office vs. Shifting Walls that became Water Fountains)\n*By: [who developed, tested, proposed this method]\n*How: [ideas for how the observation method can be applied]\n*Where/when: [in what situation, space, circumstances does the observation take place]\n*What: [what/who gets observed.

In the mean time, Anita, Martino, Carlin, Peggy, Seda, Michael, Femke have been joined by Christoph to work on The Guide To Techno-Galactic Software Observation.\n\nWe have been trying to put together a collection that works both as a documentation of the session and as a /new/ publication. As part of this we have created a list of methods for software observation that are drawn from the worksession documentation. We chose to show the materials in terms of methods for observation, hoping this loose frame can welcome irony and bending.\nWhile we are trying to reach some density and coherence, the guide does not aim for completeness. Rather we hope to give an impression of the variety of tones and materials that were manifested during our 6 days together. Now that there is some basic structure for the guide, we would like to invite you, our fellow observers, to add materials and/or add methods you feel must be in THE guide to techno-galactic software observation!\n\nHere is a first pdf: [LINK HERE]. \nYou can find the live index to all methods so far: \n    http://pad.constantvzw.org/p/observatory.guide\n    There is some markup added for generating the guide directly from pads, obviously. A few of the things missing from this pdf: A transcription from an interview with Jean Huens (Peggy), Hans' text on time, Anita contribution on punchcards. And a thousand other small things.\n\nYou are welcome to update/complete/correct existing items or to add new ones. Some examples of more or less 'complete' methods that you can copy from: \n    https://pad.constantvzw.org/p/observatory.guide.agile.yoga , \n    https://pad.constantvzw.org/p/observatory.guide.somethinginthemiddlemaybe , \n    https://pad.constantvzw.org/p/observatory.guide.visit , \n    https://pad.constantvzw.org/p/observatory.guide.monopsychism\n\nStyle guide below!\n\nIf you would like to make use of the notes from the worksession, you can find the pages indexed here: \n    http://observatory.constantvzw.org/etherdump/_new_index.html\n\nWe have only a short window of time to put this together so that we can meet the publication deadline. The deadline for your contributions is January 29\n\nIf you want to commit to a contribution, or have questions, or comments, please send an e-mail to the mailinglist [observatory@lists.constantvzw.org] in the coming days so we can all coordinate.\n\n\n----\n\nThe Techno-Galactic Software Observation Guide uses an extended dialect of markdown.\nNext to classic markdown ( https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown ) you can\nwrite `instruction lines` that tell the translator about the desired output.\nAn `instruction line` starts with '%' and takes everything after the first colon\nas input e.g.\n\n% SUPERLARGETEXT: Something all should know\n\nwill insert 'Something all should know' using whatever is considered a superlarge textsize.\n\n\nCURRENT INSTRUCTIONS\n====================\n\n% METHOD:\n\nThis is main description of the software observation method\n\n% WHAT:\n% WHEN:\n% WHO:\n% WHY:\n% HOW:\n% URGENCY:\n% WARNING:\n% REMEMBER:\n% NOTE:\n% EXAMPLE:\n% RELATESTO:\n\nStandard descriptors of the method. Somehow self-explanatory.\n\n----\n\n% SEEHERE:\n% SEEALSO:\n\nUsed for adding methods to the index.\n% SEEHERE will directly include a document.\n% SEEALSO will put a reference.\n\n----\n\n\n\n\nFUTURE INSTRUCTIONS\n===================\n\nThe markup vocabulary is meant to develop during the editing process.\nIf you have an idea about some instruction that should be added you\nmay add a `% TODO:` instructions a request for future implementation e.g.\n\n% TODO: include pdf here: http://linkt\n\n\n\n\n----\n\n\n\n\n\nLAST ROUNDS 2 DECEMBER\n\nPlanning\n\nBefore January 9:\n- Finish descriptions of clusters (Martino? + Femke?) NOT DONE\n- Finish introduction (Done for now? Maybe another round on Feb. 9?) DONE\n- Interview Jean Huens + transcription (Peggy) interview DONE, transcription next week Wed\n- Establish a level of editing that shows a balance between documentation and guidance (all of us try to finish the entries we took on)\n- Finish pdf to a point that no content is missing and we can start discussing design (Christoph) DONE!\n\nMeet January 9, 20h CET (1.5 hr meeting max)\n- See what still needs to be done\n- Send out e-mail to TGSO list: deadline 29 January\n\n[Carlin starts editing]\n\n9 February 12h CET: we meet to finish whatever needs to be done \nCarlin joins at 16h CET\n\nEnd February: print\nMain pads:\nhttp://pad.constantvzw.org/p/observatory.methods\nhttp://pad.constantvzw.org/p/observatory.guide\n\n---\n\nCarlin's questions\n- editing process\n*- different approach for primary materials (taken from workshop) vs framing materials created now\n*- in order to respect the documentation of the primary material (michael)\n*- how can this be a document that oscillates between \"look what cool methods we used and \"here are some things you could try out yourself\"\n\"If you are writing, you have liberties\" - if necessary, ask people who were involved in the thing to \n- order of entries\nhttp://pad.constantvzw.org/p/observatory.guide\n- incorporation of photographs, diagrams, etc\nYES!\n- small note (visit computer collections appears twice in the current html)\n(probably ok now?)\n\nlook for phrases / ways for introducing the chapters/groupings.

WARNING: there will be a mix of abstractions and concrete experiences.\n\nCarlin works on 3 entries\n\nThe interview needs to be done -> Peggy\n\nHans e-mail -> Martino\nAna + Ricardo -> Femke\n\nFor each of the chapter descriptions: quote from the materials/reader? Could be an image. Or a short inspirational phrase? -> Martino tries\nhttp://pad.constantvzw.org/p/observatory.guide\n\nAn email to other TGSO participants, call for help/see if further material is available (once the PDF is more stable)\n\nWARNING: pad fatigue might occur\n\nlatex todo:\n* be able to force empty new lines  (f.ex to put back lines in scrollresistance)\n* differentiate code quotes from pad quotes\n\n\n\n\n\nSAS Survival Handbook: The Ultimate Guide to Surviving Anywhere \nhttps://archive.org/stream/SASSurvivalHandbookTheUltimateGuideToSurvivingAnywhere/AppNee.com.SAS.Survival.Handbook.2nd.Edition#page/n359/mode/2up\nThe  Rudiments Of Wisdom encyclopaedia by Tim Hunkin.\nhttp://www.rudimentsofwisdom.com\n\nissue: different materials. works well to situate the week. fr an interview, a good way to introduce. but with folders, code ... so brought the SAS guide.

Do we want it to be of use? The difference between documentation and publication is the imagined audience\ndocumentation: audience is the participants, does not have the ambition to be legible to non-participants\npublication: a broader audience (with contributions from other participants but not from those who did not participate in the work session) who would be able to pick it up and understand the techno-galactic condition\n\n\nCan we decide on a few kinds of formats and test them\n- one can be a breakdown like on the methods list\n- one can be more just description/summary/exericse\n\nwe look at the methods\nand other forms of documentation\nsee if the proposed structure works\nspecifically:\n*test: make a round of groupings / hierarchies affinities\n*test: make more methods\n*test: other templates\n*\n7:20 CET back to discuss\n\nPeggy:\n\nFor the interview ... something that could be easily done, short bio interview with 2-3 q to the participants. Easy to do, and a bit is already done in the introductions. Would be good to have it in the guide for people that have not been involved. Carlin likes this too!\nP. still likes to do long interview with mr. Huens.\nWould like to write down the visit to the museum as an 19th century explorer .\n\nMartino: groupings can certainly work.

If the object is produced by the mode of observation. or what if the mode of observation is produced by the object ...\nAre we producing a guide that we want to exist or producing a document of what happened (a bit of both?)\nName the things that we might otherwise take for granted.\nHow do we name what's different about software and observation across time, without rendering the new or the old into an ideal?\nA quite litteral, chronological list: based on the week, based on the observations of/that were experimented with the week\n*we follow the methods of observation day by day, session by session and list them. \n*follow the program, but all the different things that started to happen.\n*Trying to stay chronological so we force ourselves to consider the different experiments/methods that happened.\n\n[[warning: \"our methods for observation, like mapping, come with their luggage.\" from Thursday afternoon section of http://observatory.constantvzw.org/etherdump/toc.md.diff.html ]]\n[[warning: some of these methods are not suitable for agile software/SaaS observation]]\n\nTEMPLATE FOR DESCRIBING PROPOSED METHODS:\n*By: [who developed, tested, proposed this method]\n*How: [ideas for how the observation method can be applied]\n*Where/when: [in what situation, space, circumstances does the observation take place]\n*What: [what/who gets observed.

What software category does it apply to agile/SaaS?]\n*Who: [who/what gets to observe]\n*Why: [what is the engagement, of the observer with the observed and vice versa]\n*Note: [anything that did not fit above.]\n\n*Method: Testing the testbed: testing software with observatory ambitions (SWOA)\n*By/history/source/origin/process: the \"original testbed\" was proposed by researchers/collaborators in Princeton. Testing this testbed at a local Constant workshop led to the meta-project of testing software meant for testing software. \n*How: The interwebs hosts many projects that aim to produce software for observing software, (from now on Software With Observatory Ambitions (SWOA)). A comparative methodology can be produced by using different SWOA to observe software of interest. Example: use different sniffing software to observe wireless networks. Doing so reveals what is seen as worthy of observation (e.g., what protocols, what space, which devices), the granularity of the observation (e.g., how is the observation captured, in what detail), the logo and conceptual framework of choice etc. \n*Where/when/situation?: Ideally, SWOA can be used everywhere. In reality, institutions, laws and administrators like to control the use of SWOA on infrastructures not also run by the people running it. Hence, we get distinctions like researchers and pen testers (e.g., they were hired) vs. hackers. \n*What: Deep philosophical moment: most software has a recursive observatory ambition (it wants to be observed in its execution, output etc.). Debuggers, logs, dashboards are all instances of software with observatory ambitions and can not be separated from software itself. So, what separates SWOA from software itself? HELP! \n*Who/with: If you can run the SWOA (many of these are promises more than running software/available code), you can do it. The question is: will people like it if you observe their SWOA?\n*Why/urgency/ [this is maybe related to the engagement question?]: If critical engagement in software is a thing, it follows that people would develop software to observe. \n*Note: [anything that did not fit above.]\n*WARNING: \n*REMEMBER: Good SWOA software usually uses an animal as a logo.:D\n*See also: making a bestiary of visual cultures/logos around it\n\n*Method: Rearranging space as conditioning observations (WTC vs. Museum vs. University vs. Startup Office vs. Shifting Walls that became Water Fountains)\n*By: [who developed, tested, proposed this method]\n*How: [ideas for how the observation method can be applied]\n*Where/when: [in what situation, space, circumstances does the observation take place]\n*What: [what/who gets observed.

One way to handle the publication/documentation tension would be to structure a publication around a set of ways of knowing/methods and then select and shape documentation from the worksession as samples of these methods or taking moments from the workshop as prompts for reflection on these methods. Some of the play would come in from the mix of recognizable and common methods (visit a museum (ie. Namur and Leuven), conduct interviews (ie. with Jean Heuns but also as Relational software observatory consultancy service), organize and hold a worksession (ie. what we did), listen to an expert (ie. sidechannel)) with the less common ones (ie. create a bestiary of software logos, engaging with code through collective reading/performance, etc). \n\n\n\n\nChapters/sections\n\n-possible

Editing glossary.\nQuestion: what about this warning:\nhttp://pad.constantvzw.org/p/observatory.guide.warning -- it is a meta-warning that should go first? (now under the essentials)\nShe Does Not Feel Lost.\nWhat scale of conversation? Intro could do with some tweaking, but in general works.\nRead through half of the methods. Feels familiar. Need to hand it to interested people that were not at the workshop.\nSend this to people that were at TGSO first.\nLikes the mix: Conversational and some more 'technical'.\n\nSeda also had a look -- some things to add and remove ... introduction (stops with freelancer-utopia, but what about turkers, clickworkers, on-line task workers ...)\nMight need something on services in the clinic description. Some humor!\nIn general: we could be funnier and more surreal! Funny + sharp. Could use some edge. \"We cannot be funny with software right now\"\nDatabases of populations (El Salvadoreans about to be deported, India's biometric database being sold to journalists etc)\nEmergency ... games of words. Needs some push.\nContinuous integration missing from html?\n\nhttps://pad.constantvzw.org/p/observatory.guide.introduction\nTension in the introduction. First: critical distance, then entanglement. Need to name it/connect it. Helps to tie in the quote?\nLater: \"going beyond\" ... MMo -- need to reformulate. Make quote (why it is there) more xplicit.\nDistance can be critical but not always. \n\n\nWork a bit more on the introduction, this can work on its own?\nSo the text should be a text to be read that stands on its own and does work on its own. \nMaybe the introduction needs to be more explicitly political.\n\nSeda looked for methods -- there are some missing. Christoph will make them appear!\nAlso: if we open to others, they will bring new energy.\nCalendar App Collapsing!\nPeggy: we can do this on the 9th? Or maybe not. \nSeda: separate time for sharpening the introduction, to keep serioussnes and humor together.\n\nCluster descriptions not done yet/not in the html. Should we write them or use quotes?\nSome Humor Can Go Here.\nNeeds writing -- we tried using quotes only, but it does not work for all.\n\nhttp://pad.constantvzw.org/p/observatory.guide.grouping.temporality\nhttp://pad.constantvzw.org/p/observatory.guide.grouping.languaging\nillustrations to open the groupings\nWorks well with the design! So, make mixes of images/quotes and some writing.\nCarlin: it does not need to be a lot ... one or two words. Titles already do a lot.\n\nAppendix\nPeggy has done the interview and will do the transciption by next week\nMeeting was very nice! New stories added. Anecdotes.\n(CH: what about the interview, where/how to put it?)\nLet's just put it into the https://pad.constantvzw.org/p/observatory.guide.jean.heuns pad\ndon't mind the formatting right now.\nAn hour of conversation. Keeping all of it? An excerpt? Use extracts through the quide.\nDecide on the 9th of February 2018 ?\nPeggy will do the transcription anyways. CH + FS think it could work well, different pace.\n\nWhat other extra materials could go in an Appendix?\nthe full interview Peggy did\nJogi's email\nWhat else?\nHans text on time: wanted to work on the text -- finished by 9th of February\nAnita: wrote on punchcards, needs to be finished ... a short version would be nice!!\n\nChristoph advanced on processing the pads:\nChristoph is \"pretty fine\"\n\ndifferent parts, different treatments.

In the mean time, Anita, Martino, Carlin, Peggy, Seda, Michael, Femke have been joined by Christoph to work on The Guide To Techno-Galactic Software Observation.\n\nWe have been trying to put together a collection that works both as a documentation of the session and as a /new/ publication. As part of this we have created a list of methods for software observation that are drawn from the worksession documentation. We chose to show the materials in terms of methods for observation, hoping this loose frame can welcome irony and bending.\nWhile we are trying to reach some density and coherence, the guide does not aim for completeness. Rather we hope to give an impression of the variety of tones and materials that were manifested during our 6 days together. Now that there is some basic structure for the guide, we would like to invite you, our fellow observers, to add materials and/or add methods you feel must be in THE guide to techno-galactic software observation!\n\nHere is a first pdf: [LINK HERE]. \nYou can find the live index to all methods so far: \n    http://pad.constantvzw.org/p/observatory.guide\n    There is some markup added for generating the guide directly from pads, obviously. A few of the things missing from this pdf: A transcription from an interview with Jean Huens (Peggy), Hans' text on time, Anita contribution on punchcards. And a thousand other small things.\n\nYou are welcome to update/complete/correct existing items or to add new ones. Some examples of more or less 'complete' methods that you can copy from: \n    https://pad.constantvzw.org/p/observatory.guide.agile.yoga , \n    https://pad.constantvzw.org/p/observatory.guide.somethinginthemiddlemaybe , \n    https://pad.constantvzw.org/p/observatory.guide.visit , \n    https://pad.constantvzw.org/p/observatory.guide.monopsychism\n\nStyle guide below!\n\nIf you would like to make use of the notes from the worksession, you can find the pages indexed here: \n    http://observatory.constantvzw.org/etherdump/_new_index.html\n\nWe have only a short window of time to put this together so that we can meet the publication deadline. The deadline for your contributions is January 29\n\nIf you want to commit to a contribution, or have questions, or comments, please send an e-mail to the mailinglist [observatory@lists.constantvzw.org] in the coming days so we can all coordinate.\n\n\n----\n\nThe Techno-Galactic Software Observation Guide uses an extended dialect of markdown.\nNext to classic markdown ( https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown ) you can\nwrite `instruction lines` that tell the translator about the desired output.\nAn `instruction line` starts with `%` and takes everything after the first colon\nas input e.g.\n\n% SUPERLARGETEXT: Something all should know\n\nwill insert 'Something all should know' using whatever is considered a superlarge textsize.\n\n\nCURRENT INSTRUCTIONS\n====================\n\n% METHOD:\n\nThis is main description of the software observation method\n\n% WHAT:\n% WHEN:\n% WHO:\n% WHY:\n% HOW:\n% URGENCY:\n% WARNING:\n% REMEMBER:\n% NOTE:\n% EXAMPLE:\n% RELATESTO:\n\nStandard descriptors of the method.

What software category does it apply to agile/SaaS?]\n*Who: [who/what gets to observe]\n*Why: [what is the engagement, of the observer with the observed and vice versa]\n*Note: [anything that did not fit above.]\n\n*Method: Testing the testbed: testing software with observatory ambitions (SWOA)\n*By/history/source/origin/process: the \"original testbed\" was proposed by researchers/collaborators in Princeton. Testing this testbed at a local Constant workshop led to the meta-project of testing software meant for testing software. \n*How: The interwebs hosts many projects that aim to produce software for observing software, (from now on Software With Observatory Ambitions (SWOA)). A comparative methodology can be produced by using different SWOA to observe software of interest. Example: use different sniffing software to observe wireless networks. Doing so reveals what is seen as worthy of observation (e.g., what protocols, what space, which devices), the granularity of the observation (e.g., how is the observation captured, in what detail), the logo and conceptual framework of choice etc. \n*Where/when/situation?: Ideally, SWOA can be used everywhere. In reality, institutions, laws and administrators like to control the use of SWOA on infrastructures not also run by the people running it. Hence, we get distinctions like researchers and pen testers (e.g., they were hired) vs. hackers. \n*What: Deep philosophical moment: most software has a recursive observatory ambition (it wants to be observed in its execution, output etc.). Debuggers, logs, dashboards are all instances of software with observatory ambitions and can not be separated from software itself. So, what separates SWOA from software itself? HELP! \n*Who/with: If you can run the SWOA (many of these are promises more than running software/available code), you can do it. The question is: will people like it if you observe their SWOA?\n*Why/urgency/ [this is maybe related to the engagement question?]: If critical engagement in software is a thing, it follows that people would develop software to observe. \n*Note: [anything that did not fit above.]\n*WARNING: \n*REMEMBER: Good SWOA software usually uses an animal as a logo.:D\n*See also: making a bestiary of visual cultures/logos around it\n\n*Method: Rearranging space as conditioning observations (WTC vs. Museum vs. University vs. Startup Office vs. Shifting Walls that became Water Fountains)\n*By: [who developed, tested, proposed this method]\n*How: [ideas for how the observation method can be applied]\n*Where/when: [in what situation, space, circumstances does the observation take place]\n*What: [what/who gets observed.

Namur and Leuven), conduct interviews (ie. with Jean Heuns but also as Relational software observatory consultancy service), organize and hold a worksession (ie. what we did), listen to an expert (ie.

(now under the essentials)\nShe Does Not Feel Lost.\nWhat scale of conversation? Intro could do with some tweaking, but in general works.\nRead through half of the methods. Feels familiar. Need to hand it to interested people that were not at the workshop.\nSend this to people that were at TGSO first.\nLikes the mix: Conversational and some more 'technical'.\n\nSeda also had a look -- some things to add and remove ... introduction (stops with freelancer-utopia, but what about turkers, clickworkers, on-line task workers ...)\nMight need something on services in the clinic description.

In the mean time, Anita, Martino, Carlin, Peggy, Seda, Michael, Femke have been joined by Christoph to work on The Guide To Techno-Galactic Software Observation.\n\nWe have been trying to put together a collection that works both as a documentation of the session and as a /new/ publication. As part of this we have created a list of methods for software observation that are drawn from the worksession documentation. We chose to show the materials in terms of methods for observation, hoping this loose frame can welcome irony and bending.\nWhile we are trying to reach some density and coherence, the guide does not aim for completeness. Rather we hope to give an impression of the variety of tones and materials that were manifested during our 6 days together. Now that there is some basic structure for the guide, we would like to invite you, our fellow observers, to add materials and/or add methods you feel must be in THE guide to techno-galactic software observation!\n\nHere is a first pdf: [LINK HERE]. \nYou can find the live index to all methods so far: \n    http://pad.constantvzw.org/p/observatory.guide\n    There is some markup added for generating the guide directly from pads, obviously. A few of the things missing from this pdf: A transcription from an interview with Jean Huens (Peggy), Hans' text on time, Anita contribution on punchcards. And a thousand other small things.\n\nYou are welcome to update/complete/correct existing items or to add new ones. Some examples of more or less 'complete' methods that you can copy from: \n    https://pad.constantvzw.org/p/observatory.guide.agile.yoga , \n    https://pad.constantvzw.org/p/observatory.guide.somethinginthemiddlemaybe , \n    https://pad.constantvzw.org/p/observatory.guide.visit , \n    https://pad.constantvzw.org/p/observatory.guide.monopsychism\n\nStyle guide below!\n\nIf you would like to make use of the notes from the worksession, you can find the pages indexed here: \n    http://observatory.constantvzw.org/etherdump/_new_index.html\n\nWe have only a short window of time to put this together so that we can meet the publication deadline. The deadline for your contributions is January 29\n\nIf you want to commit to a contribution, or have questions, or comments, please send an e-mail to the mailinglist [observatory@lists.constantvzw.org] in the coming days so we can all coordinate.\n\n\n----\n\nThe Techno-Galactic Software Observation Guide uses an extended dialect of markdown.\nNext to classic markdown ( https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown ) you can\nwrite `instruction lines` that tell the translator about the desired output.\nAn `instruction line` starts with `%` and takes everything after the first colon\nas input e.g.\n\n% SUPERLARGETEXT: Something all should know\n\nwill insert 'Something all should know' using whatever is considered a superlarge textsize.\n\n\nCURRENT INSTRUCTIONS\n====================\n\n% METHOD:\n\nThis is main description of the software observation method\n\n% WHAT:\n% WHEN:\n% WHO:\n% WHY:\n% HOW:\n% URGENCY:\n% WARNING:\n% REMEMBER:\n% NOTE:\n% EXAMPLE:\n% RELATESTO:\n\nStandard descriptors of the method. Somehow self-explanatory.\n\n----\n\n% SEEHERE:\n% SEEALSO:\n\nUsed for adding methods to the index.\n% SEEHERE will directly include a document.\n% SEEALSO will put a reference.\n\n----\n\nTo mark up sections you can use separators `% ------` e.g.\n\n% -----------\n\ntac ${TMPID}.part |\ngrep -nE \"^% [-]{4,} *$\" |\nhead -n 1 | cut -d \":\" -f 1\n\n% BASHCODE:\n\nwill display the section between\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFUTURE INSTRUCTIONS\n===================\n\nThe markup vocabulary is meant to develop during the editing process.\nIf you have an idea about some instruction that should be added you\nmay add a `% TODO:` instructions a request for future implementation e.g.\n\n% TODO: include pdf here: http://linktopdf\n% TODO: gigantic exclamation mark here\n% TODO: draw a box with 'some warning'\n\nCurrent instructions can be found here:\nhttps://gitlab.constantvzw.org/ch/observatory.guide/blob/master/E/tgsoguide.functions\n\n\n\n\n----\n\n\n\n\n\nLAST ROUNDS 2 DECEMBER\n\nPlanning\n\nBefore January 9:\n- Finish descriptions of clusters (Martino? + Femke?) NOT DONE\n- Finish introduction (Done for now? Maybe another round on Feb. 9?) DONE\n- Interview Jean Huens + transcription (Peggy) interview DONE, transcription next week Wed\n- Establish a level of editing that shows a balance between documentation and guidance (all of us try to finish the entries we took on)\n- Finish pdf to a point that no content is missing and we can start discussing design (Christoph) DONE!\n\nMeet January 9, 20h CET (1.5 hr meeting max)\n- See what still needs to be done\n- Send out e-mail to TGSO list: deadline 29 January\n\n[Carlin starts editing]\n\n9 February 12h CET: we meet to finish whatever needs to be done \nCarlin joins at 16h CET\n\nEnd February: print\nMain pads:\nhttp://pad.constantvzw.org/p/observatory.methods\nhttp://pad.constantvzw.org/p/observatory.guide\n\n---\n\nCarlin's questions\n- editing process\n*- different approach for primary materials (taken from workshop) vs framing materials created now\n*- in order to respect the documentation of the primary material (michael)\n*- how can this be a document that oscillates between \"look what cool methods we used and \"here are some things you could try out yourself\"\n\"If you are writing, you have liberties\" - if necessary, ask people who were involved in the thing to \n- order of entries\nhttp://pad.constantvzw.org/p/observatory.guide\n- incorporation of photographs, diagrams, etc\nYES!\n- small note (visit computer collections appears twice in the current html)\n(probably ok now?)\n\nlook for phrases / ways for introducing the chapters/groupings. Could be just a line? A task for someone?\nTest: http://pad.constantvzw.org/p/observatory.guide.grouping.temporality\n\nIntroduction http://pad.constantvzw.org/p/observatory.guide.introduction Peggy + FS + Seda first round\n\nAdd reference to the walk-in clinic? A description. Unlike normal guides: we have not removed the process. WARNING: there will be a mix of abstractions and concrete experiences.\n\nCarlin works on 3 entries\n\nThe interview needs to be done -> Peggy\n\nHans e-mail -> Martino\nAna + Ricardo -> Femke\n\nFor each of the chapter descriptions: quote from the materials/reader? Could be an image. Or a short inspirational phrase? -> Martino tries\nhttp://pad.constantvzw.org/p/observatory.guide\n\nAn email to other TGSO participants, call for help/see if further material is available (once the PDF is more stable)\n\nWARNING: pad fatigue might occur\n\nlatex todo:\n* be able to force empty new lines  (f.ex to put back lines in scrollresistance)\n* differentiate code quotes from pad quotes\n\n\n\n\n\nSAS Survival Handbook: The Ultimate Guide to Surviving Anywhere \nhttps://archive.org/stream/SASSurvivalHandbookTheUltimateGuideToSurvivingAnywhere/AppNee.com.SAS.Survival.Handbook.2nd.Edition#page/n359/mode/2up\nThe  Rudiments Of Wisdom encyclopaedia by Tim Hunkin.\nhttp://www.rudimentsofwisdom.com\n\nissue: different materials. works well to situate the week. fr an interview, a good way to introduce. but with folders, code ... so brought the SAS guide. What is good about that it is very loose ... different layers, zooms ... \nflowing things from one into the other .. not too formulaic. find ways to jump different tones.\nmultiplicity of tones. so ... something in-between the two\n\ntemplate as a way to make the connection back to the original questions ... what are the things to pay attention to, to give space to it.\n\nwe did not do any grouping, but maybe that could be interesting to try?\n\nwe were testing observatory method, the chronological order to prevent us from paying too much attention to the clinic and would also look at the exercises and thinking from the first days. \n\ncould each method then propose its form/content?\n\neven to have chapters that have no entry or only an introduction and no methods, to play the templating without feeling that we have to fulfil that template \n\nhttp://observatory.constantvzw.org/documents/mia/mia6.gif\n\nnoise is back,\n\ntest: make a round of groupings / hierarchies affinities\ntest: make more methods\ntest: other templates\n\nseda wondering about us defining different types of participants: stationary (that's us), migratory (but some stayed), walk-in (visitors to the clinic), sedentary ... was that a method?\ndo all the methods need to be related to software? YES but WHAT IS SOFTWARE\n\nsing through and to the hardware and software\n\nwhat is the 'entrypoint'(element from inventory?)-method relation\nmethods as a way to label and address things, still keeping open to other materials to enter (ie interview..)\n\nEverything in the guide is a METHOD, but how do we group and groom the methods???\n\nDo we do a publication, an event .. the fact that we have been through an event, and even that we describe it, means we are developing the methods.<- is this like observation transforms the method!?\nSo: is this documentation, or will we open it to new input. Ongoing.\n\nDifference between documentation and publication\n\nExampe: e-mail of jogi. \nThat report is already published and structured? It is an easier ongoingness -- to accept other contrib\n\nongoingness? thinking it structured around the week, and its participants. if you have not been involved, it is difficult to understand?\n\nWho is it for? Do we want it to be of use? The difference between documentation and publication is the imagined audience\ndocumentation: audience is the participants, does not have the ambition to be legible to non-participants\npublication: a broader audience (with contributions from other participants but not from those who did not participate in the work session) who would be able to pick it up and understand the techno-galactic condition\n\n\nCan we decide on a few kinds of formats and test them\n- one can be a breakdown like on the methods list\n- one can be more just description/summary/exericse\n\nwe look at the methods\nand other forms of documentation\nsee if the proposed structure works\nspecifically:\n*test: make a round of groupings / hierarchies affinities\n*test: make more methods\n*test: other templates\n*\n7:20 CET back to discuss\n\nPeggy:\n\nFor the interview ... something that could be easily done, short bio interview with 2-3 q to the participants. Easy to do, and a bit is already done in the introductions. Would be good to have it in the guide for people that have not been involved. Carlin likes this too!\nP. still likes to do long interview with mr. Huens.\nWould like to write down the visit to the museum as an 19th century explorer .\n\nMartino: groupings can certainly work.

Testing this testbed at a local Constant workshop led to the meta-project of testing software meant for testing software. \n*How: The interwebs hosts many projects that aim to produce software for observing software, (from now on Software With Observatory Ambitions (SWOA)). A comparative methodology can be produced by using different SWOA to observe software of interest. Example: use different sniffing software to observe wireless networks. Doing so reveals what is seen as worthy of observation (e.g., what protocols, what space, which devices), the granularity of the observation (e.g., how is the observation captured, in what detail), the logo and conceptual framework of choice etc. \n*Where/when/situation?: Ideally, SWOA can be used everywhere. In reality, institutions, laws and administrators like to control the use of SWOA on infrastructures not also run by the people running it. Hence, we get distinctions like researchers and pen testers (e.g., they were hired) vs. hackers. \n*What: Deep philosophical moment: most software has a recursive observatory ambition (it wants to be observed in its execution, output etc.). Debuggers, logs, dashboards are all instances of software with observatory ambitions and can not be separated from software itself. So, what separates SWOA from software itself? HELP! \n*Who/with: If you can run the SWOA (many of these are promises more than running software/available code), you can do it. The question is: will people like it if you observe their SWOA?\n*Why/urgency/ [this is maybe related to the engagement question?]: If critical engagement in software is a thing, it follows that people would develop software to observe. \n*Note: [anything that did not fit above.]\n*WARNING: \n*REMEMBER: Good SWOA software usually uses an animal as a logo.:D\n*See also: making a bestiary of visual cultures/logos around it\n\n*Method: Rearranging space as conditioning observations (WTC vs. Museum vs. University vs. Startup Office vs. Shifting Walls that became Water Fountains)\n*By: [who developed, tested, proposed this method]\n*How: [ideas for how the observation method can be applied]\n*Where/when: [in what situation, space, circumstances does the observation take place]\n*What: [what/who gets observed.

Some of the play would come in from the mix of recognizable and common methods (visit a museum (ie. Namur and Leuven), conduct interviews (ie. with Jean Heuns but also as Relational software observatory consultancy service), organize and hold a worksession (ie. what we did), listen to an expert (ie.

Testing this testbed at a local Constant workshop led to the meta-project of testing software meant for testing software. \n*How: The interwebs hosts many projects that aim to produce software for observing software, (from now on Software With Observatory Ambitions (SWOA)). A comparative methodology can be produced by using different SWOA to observe software of interest. Example: use different sniffing software to observe wireless networks. Doing so reveals what is seen as worthy of observation (e.g., what protocols, what space, which devices), the granularity of the observation (e.g., how is the observation captured, in what detail), the logo and conceptual framework of choice etc. \n*Where/when/situation?: Ideally, SWOA can be used everywhere. In reality, institutions, laws and administrators like to control the use of SWOA on infrastructures not also run by the people running it. Hence, we get distinctions like researchers and pen testers (e.g., they were hired) vs. hackers. \n*What: Deep philosophical moment: most software has a recursive observatory ambition (it wants to be observed in its execution, output etc.). Debuggers, logs, dashboards are all instances of software with observatory ambitions and can not be separated from software itself. So, what separates SWOA from software itself? HELP! \n*Who/with: If you can run the SWOA (many of these are promises more than running software/available code), you can do it. The question is: will people like it if you observe their SWOA?\n*Why/urgency/ [this is maybe related to the engagement question?]: If critical engagement in software is a thing, it follows that people would develop software to observe. \n*Note: [anything that did not fit above.]\n*WARNING: \n*REMEMBER: Good SWOA software usually uses an animal as a logo.:D\n*See also: making a bestiary of visual cultures/logos around it\n\n*Method: Rearranging space as conditioning observations (WTC vs. Museum vs. University vs. Startup Office vs. Shifting Walls that became Water Fountains)\n*By: [who developed, tested, proposed this method]\n*How: [ideas for how the observation method can be applied]\n*Where/when: [in what situation, space, circumstances does the observation take place]\n*What: [what/who gets observed.

One way to handle the publication/documentation tension would be to structure a publication around a set of ways of knowing/methods and then select and shape documentation from the worksession as samples of these methods or taking moments from the workshop as prompts for reflection on these methods. Some of the play would come in from the mix of recognizable and common methods (visit a museum (ie. Namur and Leuven), conduct interviews (ie. with Jean Heuns but also as Relational software observatory consultancy service), organize and hold a worksession (ie. what we did), listen to an expert (ie. sidechannel)) with the less common ones (ie. create a bestiary of software logos, engaging with code through collective reading/performance, etc). \n\n\n\n\nChapters/sections\n\n-possible groupings..\n\nFLOWS\nflow-regulation, logistics, seamlessness\ncontinuous integration\nfountains (refreshment)\netherpad->md->pdf->anything pipeline\nflowcharts excercise (Flow of the chart - chart of the flow on demand!)\nembodied flowchart-elevator\n\ntemporality\nflux\ntime-piece \ntempo of agile software/SaaS\n\nresistance\nuseless scroll against productivity\nInterface Détournement\n\nlanguaging\naquine \nglossary-excercise?\nqualifiers (secure, bad, bourgeois, queer..)\n\nhealing\nrelational software observatory consultancy service\nretrospection\nAgile Sun Salutation\nhand reading\nwhen dirty.db gets dirty\n\nclose encounters\nvisiting a museum\ninterviews\nasking the same question\ngetting down in your computer functioning (files/processes/ram)\nrelational software observatory consultancy service\nwith your future?blobservation\n\nembodiment/body techniques\nAgile Sun Salutation: see Healing\nCOLLECTIVE CHAIR YOGA!!!\nfountain \ncomportment of software (occupational hazards)\n\ncollections\nbestiary of software logos (we collect)\ncomputer history museum (institutional collection)\njean heuns collection at leuven (personal/institutional)\nTesting the testbed: testing software with observatory ambitions\n\n\nbeingontheside/inthemiddle/behind\nsomethinginthemiddlemaybe\nelevator\nside channel attacks\n\nMethods for inadequate observation of software [inadequate methods?]\n\nbut then the things in these groupings can be arranged/divided by form? like descrptive entries/ exercises/ diagrams/ conversation with/ gloss/\n\nWARNINGS\n[[warning: \"our methods for observation, like mapping, come with their luggage.\" from Thursday afternoon section of http://observatory.constantvzw.org/etherdump/toc.md.diff.html ]]\n[[warning: some of these methods are not suitable for agile software/SaaS observation]]\n\n\n","attribs":"|4+4q*0*1+h*0|4+2e*0+1f*2|1+1*0|3+1j*0*1+7*0|6+6g*0*1+f*0|2+2*2+1y*0|1+1*0+1g*4|1+1*6+1g*0|1+1*4|2+3j*0|5+1k*0*1+16*0|b+bl|5+1g+1h*0+9|1+1+1w*0+5|1+1+1a*0+18|2+3t+2p*0+6|du+io5*3|1+1|1+1"}}},"pad:observatory.methods:revs:5000":{"changeset":"Z:qbe>3|5l=6td=z*4+3$COd","meta":{"author":"a.eJQfyC3773rYpTah","timestamp":1515583519945,"atext":{"text":"http://pad.constantvzw.org/p/observatory.afterlives\nhttp://pad.constantvzw.org/p/observatory.inventory\nhttp://pad.constantvzw.org/p/observatory.guide --> 1-2 December\n\n9 JANUARY MEETING\n\nTO DO BEFORE 9 FEBRUARY\n\nChristoph: Style guide, new pdf\nChristoph: take care of backup\nFemke SEND EMAIL BEFORE THE WEEKEND WITH MESSY PDF\nCarlin + Seda see if they can do something for the intro (Femke maybe joins/looks over [will do!])\nAnita sends editors a proposal for punchcards, afterwards add on-line\nMartino + Femke + Anita (rescue, also): intros, 14h CET 31/01\nMartino re-ask Hans\nAll: go through methods we started/adopted\n[Carlin rereads Peggy's transcription]\n\n--\n\nAgenda for tonight meeting: \nTHE INTERNATIONAL MEETING\n- See what still needs to be done\n- Send out e-mail to TGSO list: deadline 29 January\n\nMeet here at 20h CET https://meet.jit.si/observatory\n\nEditing\nCarlin has been reading, working on some items.

In the mean time, Anita, Martino, Carlin, Peggy, Seda, Michael, Femke have been joined by Christoph to work on The Guide To Techno-Galactic Software Observation.\n\nWe have been trying to put together a collection that works both as a documentation of the session and as a /new/ publication. As part of this we have created a list of methods for software observation that are drawn from the worksession documentation. We chose to show the materials in terms of methods for observation, hoping this loose frame can welcome irony and bending.\nWhile we are trying to reach some density and coherence, the guide does not aim for completeness. Rather we hope to give an impression of the variety of tones and materials that were manifested during our 6 days together. Now that there is some basic structure for the guide, we would like to invite you, our fellow observers, to add materials and/or add methods you feel must be in THE guide to techno-galactic software observation!\n\nHere is a first pdf: [LINK HERE]. \nYou can find the live index to all methods so far: \n    http://pad.constantvzw.org/p/observatory.guide\n    There is some markup added for generating the guide directly from pads, obviously.

Testing this testbed at a local Constant workshop led to the meta-project of testing software meant for testing software. \n*How: The interwebs hosts many projects that aim to produce software for observing software, (from now on Software With Observatory Ambitions (SWOA)). A comparative methodology can be produced by using different SWOA to observe software of interest. Example: use different sniffing software to observe wireless networks. Doing so reveals what is seen as worthy of observation (e.g., what protocols, what space, which devices), the granularity of the observation (e.g., how is the observation captured, in what detail), the logo and conceptual framework of choice etc. \n*Where/when/situation?: Ideally, SWOA can be used everywhere. In reality, institutions, laws and administrators like to control the use of SWOA on infrastructures not also run by the people running it. Hence, we get distinctions like researchers and pen testers (e.g., they were hired) vs. hackers. \n*What: Deep philosophical moment: most software has a recursive observatory ambition (it wants to be observed in its execution, output etc.). Debuggers, logs, dashboards are all instances of software with observatory ambitions and can not be separated from software itself. So, what separates SWOA from software itself? HELP! \n*Who/with: If you can run the SWOA (many of these are promises more than running software/available code), you can do it. The question is: will people like it if you observe their SWOA?\n*Why/urgency/ [this is maybe related to the engagement question?]: If critical engagement in software is a thing, it follows that people would develop software to observe. \n*Note: [anything that did not fit above.]\n*WARNING: \n*REMEMBER: Good SWOA software usually uses an animal as a logo.:D\n*See also: making a bestiary of visual cultures/logos around it\n\n*Method: Rearranging space as conditioning observations (WTC vs. Museum vs. University vs. Startup Office vs. Shifting Walls that became Water Fountains)\n*By: [who developed, tested, proposed this method]\n*How: [ideas for how the observation method can be applied]\n*Where/when: [in what situation, space, circumstances does the observation take place]\n*What: [what/who gets observed.

Editing glossary.\nQuestion: what about this warning:\nhttp://pad.constantvzw.org/p/observatory.guide.warning -- it is a meta-warning that should go first? (now under the essentials)\nShe Does Not Feel Lost.\nWhat scale of conversation? Intro could do with some tweaking, but in general works.\nRead through half of the methods. Feels familiar. Need to hand it to interested people that were not at the workshop.\nSend this to people that were at TGSO first.\nLikes the mix: Conversational and some more 'technical'.\n\nSeda also had a look -- some things to add and remove ... introduction (stops with freelancer-utopia, but what about turkers, clickworkers, on-line task workers ...)\nMight need something on services in the clinic description. Some humor!\nIn general: we could be funnier and more surreal! Funny + sharp.

In the mean time, Anita, Martino, Carlin, Peggy, Seda, Michael, Femke have been joined by Christoph to work on The Guide To Techno-Galactic Software Observation.\n\nWe have been trying to put together a collection that works both as a documentation of the session and as a /new/ publication. As part of this we have created a list of methods for software observation that are drawn from the worksession documentation. We chose to show the materials in terms of methods for observation, hoping this loose frame can welcome irony and bending.\nWhile we are trying to reach some density and coherence, the guide does not aim for completeness. Rather we hope to give an impression of the variety of tones and materials that were manifested during our 6 days together. Now that there is some basic structure for the guide, we would like to invite you, our fellow observers, to add materials and/or add methods you feel must be in THE guide to techno-galactic software observation!\n\nHere is a first pdf: [LINK HERE]. \nYou can find the live index to all methods so far: \n    http://pad.constantvzw.org/p/observatory.guide\n    There is some markup added for generating the guide directly from pads, obviously. A few of the things missing from this pdf: A transcription from an interview with Jean Huens (Peggy), Hans' text on time, Anita contribution on punchcards. And a thousand other small things.\n\nYou are welcome to update/complete/correct existing items or to add new ones. Some examples of more or less 'complete' methods that you can copy from: \n    https://pad.constantvzw.org/p/observatory.guide.agile.yoga , \n    https://pad.constantvzw.org/p/observatory.guide.somethinginthemiddlemaybe , \n    https://pad.constantvzw.org/p/observatory.guide.visit , \n    https://pad.constantvzw.org/p/observatory.guide.monopsychism\n\nStyle guide below!\n\nIf you would like to make use of the notes from the worksession, you can find the pages indexed here: \n    http://observatory.constantvzw.org/etherdump/_new_index.html\n\nWe have only a short window of time to put this together so that we can meet the publication deadline. The deadline for your contributions is January 29\n\nIf you want to commit to a contribution, or have questions, or comments, please send an e-mail to the mailinglist [observatory@lists.constantvzw.org] in the coming days so we can all coordinate.\n\n\n----\n\nThe Techno-Galactic Software Observation Guide uses an extended dialect of markdown.\nNext to classic markdown ( https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown ) you can\nwrite `instruction lines` that tell the translator about the desired output.\nAn `instruction line` starts with `%` and takes everything after the first colon\nas input e.g.\n\n% SUPERLARGETEXT: Something all should know\n\nwill insert 'Something all should know' using whatever is considered a superlarge textsize.\n\n\nCURRENT INSTRUCTIONS\n====================\n\n% METHOD:\n\nThis is main description of the software observation method\n\n% WHAT:\n% WHEN:\n% WHO:\n% WHY:\n% HOW:\n% URGENCY:\n% WARNING:\n% REMEMBER:\n% NOTE:\n% EXAMPLE:\n% RELATESTO:\n\nStandard descriptors of the method. Somehow self-explanatory.\n\n----\n\n% SEEHERE:\n% SEEALSO:\n\nUsed for adding methods to the index.\n% SEEHERE will directly include a document.\n% SEEALSO will put a reference.\n\n----\n\nTo mark up sections you can use separators `% ------` e.g.\n\n% -----------\n\n tac ${TMPID}.part |\n grep -nE \"^% [-]{4,} *$\" |\n head -n 1 | cut -d \":\" -f 1\n\n% BASHCODE:\n\nwill display the section between the command\nand the separator as bash source code.\n\nAt the moment there exist following section markup:\n\n% BASHCODE: <- Bourne-Again Source Code\n% VERBATIM: <- Includes Text without translation\n               in a mono-spaced font.\n               No linebreaks -> long lines (<60) wi\n\n\n\nFUTURE INSTRUCTIONS\n===================\n\nThe markup vocabulary is meant to develop during the editing process.\nIf you have an idea about some instruction that should be added you\nmay add a `% TODO:` instructions a request for future implementation e.g.\n\n% TODO: include pdf here: http://linktopdf\n% TODO: gigantic exclamation mark here\n% TODO: draw a box with 'some warning'\n\nCurrent instructions can be found here:\nhttps://gitlab.constantvzw.org/ch/observatory.guide/blob/master/E/tgsoguide.functions\n\n\n\n\n----\n\n\n\n\n\nLAST ROUNDS 2 DECEMBER\n\nPlanning\n\nBefore January 9:\n- Finish descriptions of clusters (Martino? + Femke?)

Do we want it to be of use? The difference between documentation and publication is the imagined audience\ndocumentation: audience is the participants, does not have the ambition to be legible to non-participants\npublication: a broader audience (with contributions from other participants but not from those who did not participate in the work session) who would be able to pick it up and understand the techno-galactic condition\n\n\nCan we decide on a few kinds of formats and test them\n- one can be a breakdown like on the methods list\n- one can be more just description/summary/exericse\n\nwe look at the methods\nand other forms of documentation\nsee if the proposed structure works\nspecifically:\n*test: make a round of groupings / hierarchies affinities\n*test: make more methods\n*test: other templates\n*\n7:20 CET back to discuss\n\nPeggy:\n\nFor the interview ... something that could be easily done, short bio interview with 2-3 q to the participants. Easy to do, and a bit is already done in the introductions. Would be good to have it in the guide for people that have not been involved. Carlin likes this too!\nP. still likes to do long interview with mr. Huens.\nWould like to write down the visit to the museum as an 19th century explorer .\n\nMartino: groupings can certainly work.

Testing this testbed at a local Constant workshop led to the meta-project of testing software meant for testing software. \n*How: The interwebs hosts many projects that aim to produce software for observing software, (from now on Software With Observatory Ambitions (SWOA)). A comparative methodology can be produced by using different SWOA to observe software of interest. Example: use different sniffing software to observe wireless networks. Doing so reveals what is seen as worthy of observation (e.g., what protocols, what space, which devices), the granularity of the observation (e.g., how is the observation captured, in what detail), the logo and conceptual framework of choice etc. \n*Where/when/situation?: Ideally, SWOA can be used everywhere. In reality, institutions, laws and administrators like to control the use of SWOA on infrastructures not also run by the people running it. Hence, we get distinctions like researchers and pen testers (e.g., they were hired) vs. hackers. \n*What: Deep philosophical moment: most software has a recursive observatory ambition (it wants to be observed in its execution, output etc.). Debuggers, logs, dashboards are all instances of software with observatory ambitions and can not be separated from software itself. So, what separates SWOA from software itself? HELP! \n*Who/with: If you can run the SWOA (many of these are promises more than running software/available code), you can do it. The question is: will people like it if you observe their SWOA?\n*Why/urgency/ [this is maybe related to the engagement question?]: If critical engagement in software is a thing, it follows that people would develop software to observe. \n*Note: [anything that did not fit above.]\n*WARNING: \n*REMEMBER: Good SWOA software usually uses an animal as a logo.:D\n*See also: making a bestiary of visual cultures/logos around it\n\n*Method: Rearranging space as conditioning observations (WTC vs. Museum vs. University vs. Startup Office vs. Shifting Walls that became Water Fountains)\n*By: [who developed, tested, proposed this method]\n*How: [ideas for how the observation method can be applied]\n*Where/when: [in what situation, space, circumstances does the observation take place]\n*What: [what/who gets observed.

One way to handle the publication/documentation tension would be to structure a publication around a set of ways of knowing/methods and then select and shape documentation from the worksession as samples of these methods or taking moments from the workshop as prompts for reflection on these methods. Some of the play would come in from the mix of recognizable and common methods (visit a museum (ie. Namur and Leuven), conduct interviews (ie. with Jean Heuns but also as Relational software observatory consultancy service), organize and hold a worksession (ie. what we did), listen to an expert (ie. sidechannel)) with the less common ones (ie. create a bestiary of software logos, engaging with code through collective reading/performance, etc). \n\n\n\n\nChapters/sections\n\n-possible

Editing glossary.\nQuestion: what about this warning:\nhttp://pad.constantvzw.org/p/observatory.guide.warning -- it is a meta-warning that should go first? (now under the essentials)\nShe Does Not Feel Lost.\nWhat scale of conversation? Intro could do with some tweaking, but in general works.\nRead through half of the methods. Feels familiar. Need to hand it to interested people that were not at the workshop.\nSend this to people that were at TGSO first.\nLikes the mix: Conversational and some more 'technical'.\n\nSeda also had a look -- some things to add and remove ... introduction (stops with freelancer-utopia, but what about turkers, clickworkers, on-line task workers ...)\nMight need something on services in the clinic description. Some humor!\nIn general: we could be funnier and more surreal! Funny + sharp. Could use some edge. \"We cannot be funny with software right now\"\nDatabases of populations (El Salvadoreans about to be deported, India's biometric database being sold to journalists etc)\nEmergency ... games of words. Needs some push.\nContinuous integration missing from html?\n\nhttps://pad.constantvzw.org/p/observatory.guide.introduction\nTension in the introduction. First: critical distance, then entanglement. Need to name it/connect it. Helps to tie in the quote?\nLater: \"going beyond\" ... MMo -- need to reformulate. Make quote (why it is there) more xplicit.\nDistance can be critical but not always. \n\n\nWork a bit more on the introduction, this can work on its own?\nSo the text should be a text to be read that stands on its own and does work on its own. \nMaybe the introduction needs to be more explicitly political.\n\nSeda looked for methods -- there are some missing. Christoph will make them appear!\nAlso: if we open to others, they will bring new energy.\nCalendar App Collapsing!\nPeggy: we can do this on the 9th? Or maybe not. \nSeda: separate time for sharpening the introduction, to keep serioussnes and humor together.\n\nCluster descriptions not done yet/not in the html. Should we write them or use quotes?\nSome Humor Can Go Here.\nNeeds writing -- we tried using quotes only, but it does not work for all.\n\nhttp://pad.constantvzw.org/p/observatory.guide.grouping.temporality\nhttp://pad.constantvzw.org/p/observatory.guide.grouping.languaging\nillustrations to open the groupings\nWorks well with the design!

In the mean time, Anita, Martino, Carlin, Peggy, Seda, Michael, Femke have been joined by Christoph to work on The Guide To Techno-Galactic Software Observation.\n\nWe have been trying to put together a collection that works both as a documentation of the session and as a /new/ publication. As part of this we have created a list of methods for software observation that are drawn from the worksession documentation. We chose to show the materials in terms of methods for observation, hoping this loose frame can welcome irony and bending.\nWhile we are trying to reach some density and coherence, the guide does not aim for completeness. Rather we hope to give an impression of the variety of tones and materials that were manifested during our 6 days together. Now that there is some basic structure for the guide, we would like to invite you, our fellow observers, to add materials and/or add methods you feel must be in THE guide to techno-galactic software observation!\n\nHere is a first pdf: [LINK HERE]. \nYou can find the live index to all methods so far: \n    http://pad.constantvzw.org/p/observatory.guide\n    There is some markup added for generating the guide directly from pads, obviously. A few of the things missing from this pdf: A transcription from an interview with Jean Huens (Peggy), Hans' text on time, Anita contribution on punchcards. And a thousand other small things.\n\nYou are welcome to update/complete/correct existing items or to add new ones. Some examples of more or less 'complete' methods that you can copy from: \n    https://pad.constantvzw.org/p/observatory.guide.agile.yoga , \n    https://pad.constantvzw.org/p/observatory.guide.somethinginthemiddlemaybe , \n    https://pad.constantvzw.org/p/observatory.guide.visit , \n    https://pad.constantvzw.org/p/observatory.guide.monopsychism\n\nStyle guide below!\n\nIf you would like to make use of the notes from the worksession, you can find the pages indexed here: \n    http://observatory.constantvzw.org/etherdump/_new_index.html\n\nWe have only a short window of time to put this together so that we can meet the publication deadline. The deadline for your contributions is January 29\n\nIf you want to commit to a contribution, or have questions, or comments, please send an e-mail to the mailinglist [observatory@lists.constantvzw.org] in the coming days so we can all coordinate.\n\n\n- HOW\n\nThe Techno-Galactic Software Observation Guide uses an extended\ndialect of markdown. Next to classic markdown ( http://lfkn.de/md )\nyou may write `instruction lines` that tell the translator about the\ndesired output. An `instruction line` starts with `%` and takes\neverything after the first colon as input e.g.\n\n% SUPERLARGETEXT: Something all should know\n\nwill insert 'Something all should know' using whatever is considered\na superlarge textsize.\n\n\nCURRENT INSTRUCTIONS\n====================\n\n% METHOD: sum up the method\n\nThe main description of the software observation method\n\n% WHAT: what it is\n% WHEN: when it was\n% WHO:  who has done it\n% WHY:  the big question\n% HOW:  how to do it\n% URGENCY: why it is urgent\n% WARNING: what to beware of\n% REMEMBER: never forget\n% NOTE: a note is a note is a note\n% EXAMPLE: real or not so real world example\n% RELATESTO: http://link/to/a/pad\n\nStandard descriptors of the method.\nSomehow self-explanatory?\n\nEmpty descriptors will be ignored. To force an empty\ndescriptor, as a headline ,maybe if the content requires\nmore space, use a dash e.g.\n\n% EXAMPLE: - \n\n===========\n\n% SEEHERE: http://link/to/a/pad\n% SEEALSO: http://link/to/a/pad\n\nUsed for adding methods to the index\nhttps://pad.constantvzw.org/p/observatory.guide\n% SEEHERE will directly include a document.\n% SEEALSO will put a reference.\n\n===========\n\nTo mark up sections you can use separators `% ------` e.g.\n\n% -----------\n\n tac ${TMPID}.part |\n grep -nE \"^% [-]{4,} *$\" |\n head -n 1 | cut -d \":\" -f 1\n\n% BASHCODE:\n\nwill display the section between the command\nand the separator as bash source code.\n\nAt the moment there exist following section markups:\n\n% BASHCODE: <- Bourne-Again Source Code\n% VERBATIM: <- Includes Text without translation\n               in a mono-spaced font.\n               No linebreaks -> long lines (>80c) will overshoot\n% VERBATIMWRAP: <- same as verbatim but does linebreaks.\n\nFor requests see 'FUTURE INSTRUCTIONS'\n\n\n\nFUTURE INSTRUCTIONS\n===================\n\nThe markup vocabulary is meant to develop during the editing process.\nIf you have an idea about some instruction that should be added you\nmay add a `% TODO:` instructions a request for future implementation e.g.\n\n% TODO: include pdf here: http://linktopdf\n% TODO: gigantic exclamation mark here\n% TODO: draw a box with 'some warning'\n\n\nCurrent instruction set to be found here:\nhttps://gitlab.constantvzw.org/ch/observatory.guide/blob/master/E/tgsoguide.functions\n\n\n\n\n\nLAST ROUNDS 2 DECEMBER\n\nPlanning\n\nBefore January 9:\n- Finish descriptions of clusters (Martino? + Femke?)

What software category does it apply to agile/SaaS?]\n*Who: [who/what gets to observe]\n*Why: [what is the engagement, of the observer with the observed and vice versa]\n*Note: [anything that did not fit above.]\n\n*Method: Testing the testbed: testing software with observatory ambitions (SWOA)\n*By/history/source/origin/process: the \"original testbed\" was proposed by researchers/collaborators in Princeton. Testing this testbed at a local Constant workshop led to the meta-project of testing software meant for testing software. \n*How: The interwebs hosts many projects that aim to produce software for observing software, (from now on Software With Observatory Ambitions (SWOA)). A comparative methodology can be produced by using different SWOA to observe software of interest. Example: use different sniffing software to observe wireless networks. Doing so reveals what is seen as worthy of observation (e.g., what protocols, what space, which devices), the granularity of the observation (e.g., how is the observation captured, in what detail), the logo and conceptual framework of choice etc. \n*Where/when/situation?: Ideally, SWOA can be used everywhere. In reality, institutions, laws and administrators like to control the use of SWOA on infrastructures not also run by the people running it. Hence, we get distinctions like researchers and pen testers (e.g., they were hired) vs. hackers. \n*What: Deep philosophical moment: most software has a recursive observatory ambition (it wants to be observed in its execution, output etc.). Debuggers, logs, dashboards are all instances of software with observatory ambitions and can not be separated from software itself. So, what separates SWOA from software itself? HELP! \n*Who/with: If you can run the SWOA (many of these are promises more than running software/available code), you can do it. The question is: will people like it if you observe their SWOA?\n*Why/urgency/ [this is maybe related to the engagement question?]: If critical engagement in software is a thing, it follows that people would develop software to observe. \n*Note: [anything that did not fit above.]\n*WARNING: \n*REMEMBER: Good SWOA software usually uses an animal as a logo.:D\n*See also: making a bestiary of visual cultures/logos around it\n\n*Method: Rearranging space as conditioning observations (WTC vs. Museum vs. University vs. Startup Office vs. Shifting Walls that became Water Fountains)\n*By: [who developed, tested, proposed this method]\n*How: [ideas for how the observation method can be applied]\n*Where/when: [in what situation, space, circumstances does the observation take place]\n*What: [what/who gets observed.

What is good about that it is very loose ... different layers, zooms ... \nflowing things from one into the other .. not too formulaic. find ways to jump different tones.\nmultiplicity of tones. so ... something in-between the two\n\ntemplate as a way to make the connection back to the original questions ... what are the things to pay attention to, to give space to it.\n\nwe did not do any grouping, but maybe that could be interesting to try?\n\nwe were testing observatory method, the chronological order to prevent us from paying too much attention to the clinic and would also look at the exercises and thinking from the first days. \n\ncould each method then propose its form/content?\n\neven to have chapters that have no entry or only an introduction and no methods, to play the templating without feeling that we have to fulfil that template \n\nhttp://observatory.constantvzw.org/documents/mia/mia6.gif\n\nnoise is back,\n\ntest: make a round of groupings / hierarchies affinities\ntest: make more methods\ntest: other templates\n\nseda wondering about us defining different types of participants: stationary (that's us), migratory (but some stayed), walk-in (visitors to the clinic), sedentary ... was that a method?\ndo all the methods need to be related to software? YES but WHAT IS SOFTWARE\n\nsing through and to the hardware and software\n\nwhat is the 'entrypoint'(element from inventory?)-method relation\nmethods as a way to label and address things, still keeping open to other materials to enter (ie interview..)\n\nEverything in the guide is a METHOD, but how do we group and groom the methods???\n\nDo we do a publication, an event .. the fact that we have been through an event, and even that we describe it, means we are developing the methods.<- is this like observation transforms the method!?\nSo: is this documentation, or will we open it to new input. Ongoing.\n\nDifference between documentation and publication\n\nExampe: e-mail of jogi. \nThat report is already published and structured? It is an easier ongoingness -- to accept other contrib\n\nongoingness? thinking it structured around the week, and its participants. if you have not been involved, it is difficult to understand?\n\nWho is it for? Do we want it to be of use? The difference between documentation and publication is the imagined audience\ndocumentation: audience is the participants, does not have the ambition to be legible to non-participants\npublication: a broader audience (with contributions from other participants but not from those who did not participate in the work session) who would be able to pick it up and understand the techno-galactic condition\n\n\nCan we decide on a few kinds of formats and test them\n- one can be a breakdown like on the methods list\n- one can be more just description/summary/exericse\n\nwe look at the methods\nand other forms of documentation\nsee if the proposed structure works\nspecifically:\n*test: make a round of groupings / hierarchies affinities\n*test: make more methods\n*test: other templates\n*\n7:20 CET back to discuss\n\nPeggy:\n\nFor the interview ... something that could be easily done, short bio interview with 2-3 q to the participants. Easy to do, and a bit is already done in the introductions. Would be good to have it in the guide for people that have not been involved. Carlin likes this too!\nP. still likes to do long interview with mr. Huens.\nWould like to write down the visit to the museum as an 19th century explorer .\n\nMartino: groupings can certainly work.

Testing this testbed at a local Constant workshop led to the meta-project of testing software meant for testing software. \n*How: The interwebs hosts many projects that aim to produce software for observing software, (from now on Software With Observatory Ambitions (SWOA)). A comparative methodology can be produced by using different SWOA to observe software of interest. Example: use different sniffing software to observe wireless networks. Doing so reveals what is seen as worthy of observation (e.g., what protocols, what space, which devices), the granularity of the observation (e.g., how is the observation captured, in what detail), the logo and conceptual framework of choice etc. \n*Where/when/situation?: Ideally, SWOA can be used everywhere. In reality, institutions, laws and administrators like to control the use of SWOA on infrastructures not also run by the people running it. Hence, we get distinctions like researchers and pen testers (e.g., they were hired) vs. hackers. \n*What: Deep philosophical moment: most software has a recursive observatory ambition (it wants to be observed in its execution, output etc.). Debuggers, logs, dashboards are all instances of software with observatory ambitions and can not be separated from software itself. So, what separates SWOA from software itself? HELP! \n*Who/with: If you can run the SWOA (many of these are promises more than running software/available code), you can do it. The question is: will people like it if you observe their SWOA?\n*Why/urgency/ [this is maybe related to the engagement question?]: If critical engagement in software is a thing, it follows that people would develop software to observe. \n*Note: [anything that did not fit above.]\n*WARNING: \n*REMEMBER: Good SWOA software usually uses an animal as a logo.:D\n*See also: making a bestiary of visual cultures/logos around it\n\n*Method: Rearranging space as conditioning observations (WTC vs. Museum vs. University vs. Startup Office vs. Shifting Walls that became Water Fountains)\n*By: [who developed, tested, proposed this method]\n*How: [ideas for how the observation method can be applied]\n*Where/when: [in what situation, space, circumstances does the observation take place]\n*What: [what/who gets observed.

Some of the play would come in from the mix of recognizable and common methods (visit a museum (ie.

TGSO list: deadline 29 January\n\nMeet here at 20h CET https://meet.jit.si/observatory\n\nEditing\nCarlin has been reading, working on some items. Editing glossary.\nQuestion: what about this warning:\nhttp://pad.constantvzw.org/p/observatory.guide.warning -- it is a meta-warning that should go first? (now under the essentials)\nShe Does Not Feel Lost.\nWhat scale of conversation? Intro could do with some tweaking, but in general works.\nRead through half of the methods. Feels familiar. Need to hand it to interested people that were not at the workshop.\nSend this to people that were at TGSO first.\nLikes the mix: Conversational and some more 'technical'.\nSeda also had a look -- some things to add and remove ... introduction (stops with freelancer-utopia, but what about turkers, clickworkers, on-line task workers ...)\nMight need soem\n\nPeggy interview\nPeggy has done the interview and will do the transciption by next week\nMeeting was very nice! New stories added. Anecdotes.\n(CH: what about the interview, where/how to put it?)\nLet's just put it into the https://pad.constantvzw.org/p/observatory.guide.jean.heuns pad\ndon't mind the formatting right now.\n\nCluster descriptions not done yet/not in the html.

Do we want it to be of use? The difference between documentation and publication is the imagined audience\ndocumentation: audience is the participants, does not have the ambition to be legible to non-participants\npublication: a broader audience (with contributions from other participants but not from those who did not participate in the work session) who would be able to pick it up and understand the techno-galactic condition\n\n\nCan we decide on a few kinds of formats and test them\n- one can be a breakdown like on the methods list\n- one can be more just description/summary/exericse\n\nwe look at the methods\nand other forms of documentation\nsee if the proposed structure works\nspecifically:\n*test: make a round of groupings / hierarchies affinities\n*test: make more methods\n*test: other templates\n*\n7:20 CET back to discuss\n\nPeggy:\n\nFor the interview ... something that could be easily done, short bio interview with 2-3 q to the participants. Easy to do, and a bit is already done in the introductions. Would be good to have it in the guide for people that have not been involved. Carlin likes this too!\nP. still likes to do long interview with mr. Huens.\nWould like to write down the visit to the museum as an 19th century explorer .\n\nMartino: groupings can certainly work.

What software category does it apply to agile/SaaS?]\n*Who: [who/what gets to observe]\n*Why: [what is the engagement, of the observer with the observed and vice versa]\n*Note: [anything that did not fit above.]\n\n*Method: Testing the testbed: testing software with observatory ambitions (SWOA)\n*By/history/source/origin/process: the \"original testbed\" was proposed by researchers/collaborators in Princeton. Testing this testbed at a local Constant workshop led to the meta-project of testing software meant for testing software. \n*How: The interwebs hosts many projects that aim to produce software for observing software, (from now on Software With Observatory Ambitions (SWOA)). A comparative methodology can be produced by using different SWOA to observe software of interest. Example: use different sniffing software to observe wireless networks. Doing so reveals what is seen as worthy of observation (e.g., what protocols, what space, which devices), the granularity of the observation (e.g., how is the observation captured, in what detail), the logo and conceptual framework of choice etc. \n*Where/when/situation?: Ideally, SWOA can be used everywhere. In reality, institutions, laws and administrators like to control the use of SWOA on infrastructures not also run by the people running it. Hence, we get distinctions like researchers and pen testers (e.g., they were hired) vs. hackers. \n*What: Deep philosophical moment: most software has a recursive observatory ambition (it wants to be observed in its execution, output etc.). Debuggers, logs, dashboards are all instances of software with observatory ambitions and can not be separated from software itself. So, what separates SWOA from software itself? HELP! \n*Who/with: If you can run the SWOA (many of these are promises more than running software/available code), you can do it. The question is: will people like it if you observe their SWOA?\n*Why/urgency/ [this is maybe related to the engagement question?]: If critical engagement in software is a thing, it follows that people would develop software to observe. \n*Note: [anything that did not fit above.]\n*WARNING: \n*REMEMBER: Good SWOA software usually uses an animal as a logo.:D\n*See also: making a bestiary of visual cultures/logos around it\n\n*Method: Rearranging space as conditioning observations (WTC vs. Museum vs. University vs. Startup Office vs. Shifting Walls that became Water Fountains)\n*By: [who developed, tested, proposed this method]\n*How: [ideas for how the observation method can be applied]\n*Where/when: [in what situation, space, circumstances does the observation take place]\n*What: [what/who gets observed.

Namur and Leuven), conduct interviews (ie. with Jean Heuns but also as Relational software observatory consultancy service), organize and hold a worksession (ie. what we did), listen to an expert (ie. sidechannel)) with the less common ones (ie. create a bestiary of software logos, engaging with code through collective reading/performance, etc). \n\n\n\n\nChapters/sections\n\n-possible groupings..\n\nFLOWS\nflow-regulation, logistics, seamlessness\ncontinuous integration\nfountains (refreshment)\netherpad->md->pdf->anything pipeline\nflowcharts excercise (Flow of the chart - chart of the flow on demand!)\nembodied flowchart-elevator\n\ntemporality\nflux\ntime-piece \ntempo of agile software/SaaS\n\nresistance\nuseless scroll against productivity\nInterface Détournement\n\nlanguaging\naquine \nglossary-excercise?\nqualifiers (secure, bad, bourgeois, queer..)\n\nhealing\nrelational software observatory consultancy service\nretrospection\nAgile Sun Salutation\nhand reading\nwhen dirty.db gets dirty\n\nclose encounters\nvisiting a museum\ninterviews\nasking the same question\ngetting down in your computer functioning (files/processes/ram)\nrelational software observatory consultancy service\nwith your future?blobservation\n\nembodiment/body techniques\nAgile Sun Salutation: see Healing\nCOLLECTIVE CHAIR YOGA!!!\nfountain \ncomportment of software (occupational hazards)\n\ncollections\nbestiary of software logos (we collect)\ncomputer history museum (institutional collection)\njean heuns collection at leuven (personal/institutional)\nTesting the testbed: testing software with observatory ambitions\n\n\nbeingontheside/inthemiddle/behind\nsomethinginthemiddlemaybe\nelevator\nside channel attacks\n\nMethods for inadequate observation of software [inadequate methods?]\n\nbut then the things in these groupings can be arranged/divided by form?

Do we want it to be of use? The difference between documentation and publication is the imagined audience\ndocumentation: audience is the participants, does not have the ambition to be legible to non-participants\npublication: a broader audience (with contributions from other participants but not from those who did not participate in the work session) who would be able to pick it up and understand the techno-galactic condition\n\n\nCan we decide on a few kinds of formats and test them\n- one can be a breakdown like on the methods list\n- one can be more just description/summary/exericse\n\nwe look at the methods\nand other forms of documentation\nsee if the proposed structure works\nspecifically:\n*test: make a round of groupings / hierarchies affinities\n*test: make more methods\n*test: other templates\n*\n7:20 CET back to discuss\n\nPeggy:\n\nFor the interview ... something that could be easily done, short bio interview with 2-3 q to the participants. Easy to do, and a bit is already done in the introductions. Would be good to have it in the guide for people that have not been involved. Carlin likes this too!\nP. still likes to do long interview with mr. Huens.\nWould like to write down the visit to the museum as an 19th century explorer .\n\nMartino: groupings can certainly work.

What software category does it apply to agile/SaaS?]\n*Who: [who/what gets to observe]\n*Why: [what is the engagement, of the observer with the observed and vice versa]\n*Note: [anything that did not fit above.]\n\n*Method: Testing the testbed: testing software with observatory ambitions (SWOA)\n*By/history/source/origin/process: the \"original testbed\" was proposed by researchers/collaborators in Princeton. Testing this testbed at a local Constant workshop led to the meta-project of testing software meant for testing software. \n*How: The interwebs hosts many projects that aim to produce software for observing software, (from now on Software With Observatory Ambitions (SWOA)). A comparative methodology can be produced by using different SWOA to observe software of interest. Example: use different sniffing software to observe wireless networks. Doing so reveals what is seen as worthy of observation (e.g., what protocols, what space, which devices), the granularity of the observation (e.g., how is the observation captured, in what detail), the logo and conceptual framework of choice etc. \n*Where/when/situation?: Ideally, SWOA can be used everywhere. In reality, institutions, laws and administrators like to control the use of SWOA on infrastructures not also run by the people running it. Hence, we get distinctions like researchers and pen testers (e.g., they were hired) vs. hackers. \n*What: Deep philosophical moment: most software has a recursive observatory ambition (it wants to be observed in its execution, output etc.). Debuggers, logs, dashboards are all instances of software with observatory ambitions and can not be separated from software itself. So, what separates SWOA from software itself? HELP! \n*Who/with: If you can run the SWOA (many of these are promises more than running software/available code), you can do it. The question is: will people like it if you observe their SWOA?\n*Why/urgency/ [this is maybe related to the engagement question?]: If critical engagement in software is a thing, it follows that people would develop software to observe. \n*Note: [anything that did not fit above.]\n*WARNING: \n*REMEMBER: Good SWOA software usually uses an animal as a logo.:D\n*See also: making a bestiary of visual cultures/logos around it\n\n*Method: Rearranging space as conditioning observations (WTC vs. Museum vs. University vs. Startup Office vs. Shifting Walls that became Water Fountains)\n*By: [who developed, tested, proposed this method]\n*How: [ideas for how the observation method can be applied]\n*Where/when: [in what situation, space, circumstances does the observation take place]\n*What: [what/who gets observed.

One way to handle the publication/documentation tension would be to structure a publication around a set of ways of knowing/methods and then select and shape documentation from the worksession as samples of these methods or taking moments from the workshop as prompts for reflection on these methods. Some of the play would come in from the mix of recognizable and common methods (visit a museum (ie. Namur and Leuven), conduct interviews (ie. with Jean Heuns but also as Relational software observatory consultancy service), organize and hold a worksession (ie. what we did), listen to an expert (ie. sidechannel)) with the less common ones (ie. create a bestiary of software logos, engaging with code through collective reading/performance, etc). \n\n\n\n\nChapters/sections\n\n-possible

What software category does it apply to agile/SaaS?]\n*Who: [who/what gets to observe]\n*Why: [what is the engagement, of the observer with the observed and vice versa]\n*Note: [anything that did not fit above.]\n\n*Method: Testing the testbed: testing software with observatory ambitions (SWOA)\n*By/history/source/origin/process: the \"original testbed\" was proposed by researchers/collaborators in Princeton. Testing this testbed at a local Constant workshop led to the meta-project of testing software meant for testing software. \n*How: The interwebs hosts many projects that aim to produce software for observing software, (from now on Software With Observatory Ambitions (SWOA)). A comparative methodology can be produced by using different SWOA to observe software of interest. Example: use different sniffing software to observe wireless networks. Doing so reveals what is seen as worthy of observation (e.g., what protocols, what space, which devices), the granularity of the observation (e.g., how is the observation captured, in what detail), the logo and conceptual framework of choice etc. \n*Where/when/situation?: Ideally, SWOA can be used everywhere. In reality, institutions, laws and administrators like to control the use of SWOA on infrastructures not also run by the people running it. Hence, we get distinctions like researchers and pen testers (e.g., they were hired) vs. hackers. \n*What: Deep philosophical moment: most software has a recursive observatory ambition (it wants to be observed in its execution, output etc.). Debuggers, logs, dashboards are all instances of software with observatory ambitions and can not be separated from software itself. So, what separates SWOA from software itself? HELP! \n*Who/with: If you can run the SWOA (many of these are promises more than running software/available code), you can do it. The question is: will people like it if you observe their SWOA?\n*Why/urgency/ [this is maybe related to the engagement question?]: If critical engagement in software is a thing, it follows that people would develop software to observe. \n*Note: [anything that did not fit above.]\n*WARNING: \n*REMEMBER: Good SWOA software usually uses an animal as a logo.:D\n*See also: making a bestiary of visual cultures/logos around it\n\n*Method: Rearranging space as conditioning observations (WTC vs. Museum vs. University vs. Startup Office vs. Shifting Walls that became Water Fountains)\n*By: [who developed, tested, proposed this method]\n*How: [ideas for how the observation method can be applied]\n*Where/when: [in what situation, space, circumstances does the observation take place]\n*What: [what/who gets observed.

One way to handle the publication/documentation tension would be to structure a publication around a set of ways of knowing/methods and then select and shape documentation from the worksession as samples of these methods or taking moments from the workshop as prompts for reflection on these methods. Some of the play would come in from the mix of recognizable and common methods (visit a museum (ie. Namur and Leuven), conduct interviews (ie. with Jean Heuns but also as Relational software observatory consultancy service), organize and hold a worksession (ie. what we did), listen to an expert (ie. sidechannel)) with the less common ones (ie. create a bestiary of software logos, engaging with code through collective reading/performance, etc). \n\n\n\n\nChapters/sections\n\n-possible groupings..\n\nFLOWS\nflow-regulation, logistics, seamlessness\ncontinuous integration\nfountains (refreshment)\netherpad->md->pdf->anything pipeline\nflowcharts excercise (Flow of the chart - chart of the flow on demand!)\nembodied flowchart-elevator\n\ntemporality\nflux\ntime-piece \ntempo of agile software/SaaS\n\nresistance\nuseless scroll against productivity\nInterface Détournement\n\nlanguaging\naquine \nglossary-excercise?\nqualifiers (secure, bad, bourgeois, queer..)\n\nhealing\nrelational software observatory consultancy service\nretrospection\nAgile Sun Salutation\nhand reading\nwhen dirty.db gets dirty\n\nclose encounters\nvisiting a museum\ninterviews\nasking the same question\ngetting down in your computer functioning (files/processes/ram)\nrelational software observatory consultancy service\nwith your future?blobservation\n\nembodiment/body techniques\nAgile Sun Salutation: see Healing\nCOLLECTIVE CHAIR YOGA!!!\nfountain \ncomportment of software (occupational hazards)\n\ncollections\nbestiary of software logos (we collect)\ncomputer history museum (institutional collection)\njean heuns collection at leuven (personal/institutional)\nTesting the testbed: testing software with observatory ambitions\n\n\nbeingontheside/inthemiddle/behind\nsomethinginthemiddlemaybe\nelevator\nside channel attacks\n\nMethods for inadequate observation of software [inadequate methods?]\n\nbut then the things in these groupings can be arranged/divided by form?

In the mean time, Anita, Martino, Carlin, Peggy, Seda, Michael, Femke have been joined by Christoph to work on The Guide To Techno-Galactic Software Observation.\n\nWe have been trying to put together a collection that works both as a documentation of the session and as a /new/ publication. As part of this we have created a list of methods for software observation that are drawn from the worksession documentation. We chose to show the materials in terms of methods for observation, hoping this loose frame can welcome irony and bending.\nWhile we are trying to reach some density and coherence, the guide does not aim for completeness. Rather we hope to give an impression of the variety of tones and materials that were manifested during our 6 days together. Now that there is some basic structure for the guide, we would like to invite you, our fellow observers, to add materials and/or add methods you feel must be in THE guide to techno-galactic software observation!\n\nHere is a first pdf: [LINK HERE]. \nYou can find the live index to all methods so far: \n    http://pad.constantvzw.org/p/observatory.guide\n    There is some markup added for generating the guide directly from pads, obviously. A few of the things missing from this pdf: A transcription from an interview with Jean Huens (Peggy), Hans' text on time, Anita contribution on punchcards. And a thousand other small things.\n\nYou are welcome to update/complete/correct existing items or to add new ones. Some examples of more or less 'complete' methods that you can copy from: \n    https://pad.constantvzw.org/p/observatory.guide.agile.yoga , \n    https://pad.constantvzw.org/p/observatory.guide.somethinginthemiddlemaybe , \n    https://pad.constantvzw.org/p/observatory.guide.visit , \n    https://pad.constantvzw.org/p/observatory.guide.monopsychism\n\nStyle guide below!\n\nIf you would like to make use of the notes from the worksession, you can find the pages indexed here: \n    http://observatory.constantvzw.org/etherdump/_new_index.html\n\nWe have only a short window of time to put this together so that we can meet the publication deadline. The deadline for your contributions is January 29\n\nIf you want to commit to a contribution, or have questions, or comments, please send an e-mail to the mailinglist [observatory@lists.constantvzw.org] in the coming days so we can all coordinate.\n\n\n= = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = =\n= HOWTOEDIT = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = =\n= = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = =\n\nThe Techno-Galactic Software Observation Guide uses an extended\ndialect of markdown. Next to classic markdown ( http://lfkn.de/md )\nyou may write `instruction lines` that tell the translator about the\ndesired output. An `instruction line` starts with `%` and takes\neverything after the first colon as input e.g.\n\n% SUPERLARGETEXT: Something all should know\n\nwill insert 'Something all should know' using whatever is considered\na superlarge textsize.\n\n\nCURRENT INSTRUCTIONS\n====================\n\n% METHOD: sum up the method\n\nThe main description of the software observation method\n\n% WHAT: what it is\n% WHEN: when it was\n% WHO:  who has done it\n% WHY:  the big question\n% HOW:  how to do it\n% URGENCY: why it is urgent\n% WARNING: what to beware of\n% REMEMBER: never forget\n% NOTE: a note is a note is a note\n% EXAMPLE: real or not so real world example\n% RELATESTO: http://link/to/a/pad\n\nStandard descriptors of the method.\nSomehow self-explanatory?\n\nEmpty descriptors will be ignored. To force an empty\ndescriptor, maybe as a headline, if the content requires\nmore space, use a dash e.g.\n\n% EXAMPLE: - \n\n===========\n\n% SEEHERE: http://link/to/a/pad\n% SEEALSO: http://link/to/a/pad\n\nUsed for adding methods to the index\nhttps://pad.constantvzw.org/p/observatory.guide\n% SEEHERE will directly include a document.\n% SEEALSO will put a reference.\n\n===========\n\nTo mark up sections you can use separators `% ------` e.g.\n\n% -----------\n\n tac ${TMPID}.part |\n grep -nE \"^% [-]{4,} *$\" |\n head -n 1 | cut -d \":\" -f 1\n\n% BASHCODE:\n\nwill display the section between the command\nand the separator as bash source code.\n\nAt the moment there exist following section markups:\n\n% BASHCODE:     <- Bourne-Again Source Code\n% VERBATIM:     <- Includes Text as it is in a mono-spaced font.\n                   No linebreaks -> long lines (>80c) will overshoot\n% VERBATIMWRAP: <- same as verbatim but does linebreaks.\n\nFor requests see 'FUTURE INSTRUCTIONS'\n\n\n\nFUTURE INSTRUCTIONS\n===================\n\nThe markup vocabulary is meant to develop during the editing process.\nIf you have an idea about some instruction that should be added,\nyou may write a `% TODO:` instruction as a request for future implementation e.g.\n\n% TODO: include pdf here: http://linktopdf\n% TODO: gigantic exclamation mark here\n% TODO: draw a box with 'some warning'\n\n\nCurrent instruction set to be found here:\nhttps://gitlab.constantvzw.org/ch/observatory.guide/blob/master/E/tgsoguide.functions\n\n\n= = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = =\n\n\n\nLAST ROUNDS 2 DECEMBER\n\nPlanning\n\nBefore January 9:\n- Finish descriptions of clusters (Martino? + Femke?)

Could be just a line? A task for someone?\nTest: http://pad.constantvzw.org/p/observatory.guide.grouping.temporality\n\nIntroduction http://pad.constantvzw.org/p/observatory.guide.introduction Peggy + FS + Seda first round\n\nAdd reference to the walk-in clinic?

Or a short inspirational phrase? -> Martino tries\nhttp://pad.constantvzw.org/p/observatory.guide\n\nAn email to other TGSO participants, call for help/see if further material is available (once the PDF is more stable)\n\nWARNING: pad fatigue might occur\n\nlatex todo:\n* be able to force empty new lines  (f.ex to put back lines in scrollresistance)\n* differentiate code quotes from pad quotes\n\n\n\n\n\nSAS Survival Handbook: The Ultimate Guide to Surviving Anywhere \nhttps://archive.org/stream/SASSurvivalHandbookTheUltimateGuideToSurvivingAnywhere/AppNee.com.SAS.Survival.Handbook.2nd.Edition#page/n359/mode/2up\nThe  Rudiments Of Wisdom encyclopaedia by Tim Hunkin.\nhttp://www.rudimentsofwisdom.com\n\nissue: different materials. works well to situate the week. fr an interview, a good way to introduce. but with folders, code ... so brought the SAS guide. What is good about that it is very loose ... different layers, zooms ... \nflowing things from one into the other .. not too formulaic. find ways to jump different tones.\nmultiplicity of tones. so ... something in-between the two\n\ntemplate as a way to make the connection back to the original questions ... what are the things to pay attention to, to give space to it.\n\nwe did not do any grouping, but maybe that could be interesting to try?\n\nwe were testing observatory method, the chronological order to prevent us from paying too much attention to the clinic and would also look at the exercises and thinking from the first days. \n\ncould each method then propose its form/content?\n\neven to have chapters that have no entry or only an introduction and no methods, to play the templating without feeling that we have to fulfil that template \n\nhttp://observatory.constantvzw.org/documents/mia/mia6.gif\n\nnoise is back,\n\ntest: make a round of groupings / hierarchies affinities\ntest: make more methods\ntest: other templates\n\nseda wondering about us defining different types of participants: stationary (that's us), migratory (but some stayed), walk-in (visitors to the clinic), sedentary ... was that a method?\ndo all the methods need to be related to software? YES but WHAT IS SOFTWARE\n\nsing through and to the hardware and software\n\nwhat is the 'entrypoint'(element from inventory?)-method relation\nmethods as a way to label and address things, still keeping open to other materials to enter (ie interview..)\n\nEverything in the guide is a METHOD, but how do we group and groom the methods???\n\nDo we do a publication, an event .. the fact that we have been through an event, and even that we describe it, means we are developing the methods.<- is this like observation transforms the method!?\nSo: is this documentation, or will we open it to new input. Ongoing.\n\nDifference between documentation and publication\n\nExampe: e-mail of jogi. \nThat report is already published and structured? It is an easier ongoingness -- to accept other contrib\n\nongoingness? thinking it structured around the week, and its participants. if you have not been involved, it is difficult to understand?\n\nWho is it for? Do we want it to be of use? The difference between documentation and publication is the imagined audience\ndocumentation: audience is the participants, does not have the ambition to be legible to non-participants\npublication: a broader audience (with contributions from other participants but not from those who did not participate in the work session) who would be able to pick it up and understand the techno-galactic condition\n\n\nCan we decide on a few kinds of formats and test them\n- one can be a breakdown like on the methods list\n- one can be more just description/summary/exericse\n\nwe look at the methods\nand other forms of documentation\nsee if the proposed structure works\nspecifically:\n*test: make a round of groupings / hierarchies affinities\n*test: make more methods\n*test: other templates\n*\n7:20 CET back to discuss\n\nPeggy:\n\nFor the interview ... something that could be easily done, short bio interview with 2-3 q to the participants. Easy to do, and a bit is already done in the introductions. Would be good to have it in the guide for people that have not been involved. Carlin likes this too!\nP. still likes to do long interview with mr. Huens.\nWould like to write down the visit to the museum as an 19th century explorer .\n\nMartino: groupings can certainly work.

Testing this testbed at a local Constant workshop led to the meta-project of testing software meant for testing software. \n*How: The interwebs hosts many projects that aim to produce software for observing software, (from now on Software With Observatory Ambitions (SWOA)). A comparative methodology can be produced by using different SWOA to observe software of interest. Example: use different sniffing software to observe wireless networks. Doing so reveals what is seen as worthy of observation (e.g., what protocols, what space, which devices), the granularity of the observation (e.g., how is the observation captured, in what detail), the logo and conceptual framework of choice etc. \n*Where/when/situation?: Ideally, SWOA can be used everywhere. In reality, institutions, laws and administrators like to control the use of SWOA on infrastructures not also run by the people running it. Hence, we get distinctions like researchers and pen testers (e.g., they were hired) vs. hackers. \n*What: Deep philosophical moment: most software has a recursive observatory ambition (it wants to be observed in its execution, output etc.). Debuggers, logs, dashboards are all instances of software with observatory ambitions and can not be separated from software itself. So, what separates SWOA from software itself? HELP! \n*Who/with: If you can run the SWOA (many of these are promises more than running software/available code), you can do it. The question is: will people like it if you observe their SWOA?\n*Why/urgency/ [this is maybe related to the engagement question?]: If critical engagement in software is a thing, it follows that people would develop software to observe. \n*Note: [anything that did not fit above.]\n*WARNING: \n*REMEMBER: Good SWOA software usually uses an animal as a logo.:D\n*See also: making a bestiary of visual cultures/logos around it\n\n*Method: Rearranging space as conditioning observations (WTC vs. Museum vs. University vs. Startup Office vs. Shifting Walls that became Water Fountains)\n*By: [who developed, tested, proposed this method]\n*How: [ideas for how the observation method can be applied]\n*Where/when: [in what situation, space, circumstances does the observation take place]\n*What: [what/who gets observed.

One way to handle the publication/documentation tension would be to structure a publication around a set of ways of knowing/methods and then select and shape documentation from the worksession as samples of these methods or taking moments from the workshop as prompts for reflection on these methods. Some of the play would come in from the mix of recognizable and common methods (visit a museum (ie. Namur and Leuven), conduct interviews (ie. with Jean Heuns but also as Relational software observatory consultancy service), organize and hold a worksession (ie. what we did), listen to an expert (ie. sidechannel)) with the less common ones (ie. create a bestiary of software logos, engaging with code through collective reading/performance, etc). \n\n\n\n\nChapters/sections\n\n-possible groupings..\n\nFLOWS\nflow-regulation, logistics, seamlessness\ncontinuous integration\nfountains (refreshment)\netherpad->md->pdf->anything pipeline\nflowcharts excercise (Flow of the chart - chart of the flow on demand!)\nembodied flowchart-elevator\n\ntemporality\nflux\ntime-piece \ntempo of agile software/SaaS\n\nresistance\nuseless scroll against productivity\nInterface Détournement\n\nlanguaging\naquine \nglossary-excercise?\nqualifiers (secure, bad, bourgeois, queer..)\n\nhealing\nrelational software observatory consultancy service\nretrospection\nAgile Sun Salutation\nhand reading\nwhen dirty.db gets dirty\n\nclose encounters\nvisiting a museum\ninterviews\nasking the same question\ngetting down in your computer functioning (files/processes/ram)\nrelational software observatory consultancy service\nwith your future?blobservation\n\nembodiment/body techniques\nAgile Sun Salutation: see Healing\nCOLLECTIVE CHAIR YOGA!!!\nfountain \ncomportment of software (occupational hazards)\n\ncollections\nbestiary of software logos (we collect)\ncomputer history museum (institutional collection)\njean heuns collection at leuven (personal/institutional)\nTesting the testbed: testing software with observatory ambitions\n\n\nbeingontheside/inthemiddle/behind\nsomethinginthemiddlemaybe\nelevator\nside channel attacks\n\nMethods for inadequate observation of software [inadequate methods?]\n\nbut then the things in these groupings can be arranged/divided by form? like descrptive entries/ exercises/ diagrams/ conversation with/ gloss/\n\nWARNINGS\n[[warning: \"our methods for observation, like mapping, come with their luggage.\" from Thursday afternoon section of http://observatory.constantvzw.org/etherdump/toc.md.diff.html ]]\n[[warning: some of these methods are not suitable for agile software/SaaS observation]]\n\n\n","attribs":"|1+1g+1e*0|1+1|2+1t*0*1+h*0|4+r*0+o*0*a+7*0|1+1*0*a+u*0|1+1*0*a+1e*0|d+bw*0+1f*2|1+1*0|3+1j*0*1+7*0|d+pt*2|1+3e*0|5+7s*0+2o*2|3+18*0|2+1s*2|2+48*0|a+dr*4|4+4s*0|3+4j*0*1+8*0|1+1*2+1y*0|1+1*0+1g*4|1+1*6+1g*0|1+1*4|2+3j*0|1+2g*0+e*0*1+m*0|2+2k*2|4+2n*2+a*0|4+4k*0*1+16*0|1+1*2|2+s*0|c+gm*4+11*0|3+n*0*1+12*0|3+11*4+12*2|1+1*2+1*4+1*2+2b*0|6+21*0+1l*2+1*0+3z*3+1*7+1*0+h*2+b*0|1+2*2|1+1*7+1h*8+6*7+1*0+5*8+5*0+8*8+8*0+h*8+a*0+e*2+3h*3|1+3g*0+1*7+s*3+4*7+1r*3+1*7+1*3+1*7+5*3+8*7+1o*3+1e*7+29*3+5*7+h*3+1*7+1a*3+1p*0|2+2*0+y*3|1+1*0+z*3+f*0+1*3|1+1*3+4*0+1a*3|1+1*3+4*0|2+7n*0+26*7+h*0+d*7+i*0+n*7+2*3|1+1*3+4*7+1p*3|1+1*3+4*7+24*3|1+1*3+4*7+1k*3|1+1*3+4*7|1+1p*3|1+1*0|1+j*3|1+1*3+x*0+3*3|1+1v*3+1s*0|1+1*3|1+1*0+7*2+5*0+r*2+35*0|2+2*0+37*8+x*0|2+1c*4|1+1+1x*b|1+1+1x*b|1+1+1x*4|2+2+1r*b|1+1+1v*b|1+1+1w*b|1+1+1r*b|1+1+1a*b|2+2+17*b|2+2+1w*b|1+1+m*b|3+3+k*b|1+1+k*b|2+2+r*b|2+2+1j*b|2+2+i*b|1+1+j*b|1+1+n*b|1+1+o*b|1+1+k*b|1+1+r*b|1+1+s*b|1+1+o*b|1+1+y*b|1+1+18*b|1+1+x*b|2+2+z*b|1+1+p*b|2+2+1g*b|1+1+1k*b|1+1+r*b|2+2+d*b|2+2+b*b|2+2+v*b|1+1+v*b|2+2+10*b|1+1+1b*b|1+1+17*b|1+1+v*b|2+2+b*b|2+2+1m*b|2+2+d*b|2+2+k*b|1+1+r*b|1+1+s*b|2+2+b*b|2+2+18*b|1+1+12*b|2+2+1g*b|2+2+17*b|1+1+1s*b|1+1+1w*b|1+1+1k*b|2+2+12*b|4+4+j*b|1+1+j*b|2+2+1x*b|1+1+1s*b|1+1+29*b|2+2+16*b|1+1+12*b|1+1+12*b|3+3+15*b|1+1+2d*0|1+1*4|1+1*0|1+1+1x*0|4+4|5+1g+1h*0+9|1+1+1w*0+5|1+1+1a*0+18|2+3t+2p*0+6|du+io5*3|1+1|1+1"},"pool":{"numToAttrib":{"0":["author","a.ocPhP3HyN6Ppfg6m"],"1":["bold","true"],"2":["author","a.EXnmpSWanmHBGv1u"],"3":["author","a.jzuxQRlQ52uJVG5R"],"4":["author","a.eJQfyC3773rYpTah"],"5":["author",""],"6":["italic","true"],"7":["author","a.CLJqMQchPGX2f376"],"8":["author","a.FS4gi3J1UpICWomv"],"9":["bold",""],"10":["strikethrough","true"],"11":["author","a.PRabeGfk5jCXUq8V"]},"nextNum":12},"head":5263,"chatHead":-1,"publicStatus":false,"passwordHash":null,"savedRevisions":[{"revNum":1101,"savedById":"a.EXnmpSWanmHBGv1u","label":"Revision 1101","timestamp":1515526553257,"id":"2cf8b2897d3104d23963"}]}}
