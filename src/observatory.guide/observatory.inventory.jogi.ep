The processing tool chain has been disabled btw.  We did\nnot want to mess up any of the already generated .pdf, .html and .md\nfiles.\n\nWe still don't know why exactly etherpad stopped working sometime\nSunday evening or how the zeroes got into the file dirty.db.  Anita\nthought that she caused the error when she adjusted time on\netherbox.local, but the logfile does not reflect that.  The last clean\nentry in /var/log/syslog regarding nodejs/etherpad is recorded with a\ntimestamp of something along the line of 'Jun 10 10:17'.  Some minutes\nlater, around 'Jun 10 10:27' the first error appears.  These timestamps\nreflect the etherbox's understanding of time btw, not 'real time'.\n\nIt might be that the file just got too big for etherpad to handle\nit.  The size of the repaired dirty.db file was already 757MB.  That\ncould btw explain why etherpad was working somewhat slugishly after\nsome days.  There is still a chance that the time adjustment had an\nunwanted side effect, but so far there is no obvious reason for what\nhad happened.\n</md>\n-- \nJ.Hofm√ºller\n\n           http://thesix.mur.at/\n\n","attribs":"|2y+44l"},"pool":{"numToAttrib":{},"nextNum":0},"head":9,"chatHead":-1,"publicStatus":false,"passwordHash":null,"savedRevisions":[]}}
