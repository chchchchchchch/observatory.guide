% METHOD: Flowcharts (Flow of the chart –> chart of the flow: on demand!) 

% WHAT:  A flowchart is a type of diagram that represents an algorithm, workflow or process, showing the steps as boxes of various kinds, and their order by connecting them with arrows. This diagrammatic representation illustrates a solution model to a given problem. Flowcharts are used in analyzing, designing, documenting or managing a process or program in various fields.

% WHY: Through flowcharts one will be able to analyse and reflect on one's own software situation. 
% URGENCY: Using flowchart observation methods towards analysis and self-reflection of software situation.
% NOTE: The term 'software situation' is suggested as a good replacement for 'software problem'.

**Sample Flowchart Questionnaire**

% ----------------

1. Validate your situation? 
2. Is it human or machine situation?
human             machine                  I don't know
            |                   |                          |
3. Choose a flowchart element that best describes your situation?
    ▭                ♢                          ⏢

Operation →  Represented as trapez    ⏢    
Process   →  Represented as rectangle ▭    
Decision  →  Represented as rhombus   ♢

According to your answer go to question 4.

 4.1 Identify operation(s) that could
     help you out through the situation?
 4.2 Identify process(es)  that could
     help you out through the situation?
 4.3 Identify decision(s)  that could
     help you out through the situation?

5. Was that actually helpful?
         Yes                                      No 
          |                                       |
        Done                        o. How does that make you feel?

Friday:    
15:30 - 16:15    
We started our undertaking by analysing the rulers by IBM and Burroughs. It seems that every symbol on the ruler with specific shape has special meaning. There are similarities between the shapes on the two rulers. On the Burroughs we found some symbols without description. We try to figure out their meaning. In total we counted on the X IBM and on the X Burroughs symbols. The specific literature explained us that engineer have a kind of standard for these symbols. These symbols are vocabulary 

16:15 - 16:40    
We started with analysing a educational flow chart as our case example (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flowchart#/media/File:LampFlowchart.svg). We could figure out what the arrows on the ruler means, they are used in compination with the decision symbol. In shape studies Triangles can direct movement based which way they point.Triangles can direct movement based which way they point. In the flowchart the options are represented by rectangles and quares in shape studies rectangles and squares are stable. They’re familiar and trusted shapes and suggest honesty. 

16:45 - 17:00    
We analysed a flow chart of a multiplication algorithm. Its content illustrating to shift left or right the number. The decision box instructing you to repeat it 32 times for the whole number! 
The rectangles are again representing options, while the flexible factors are illustrated by the rhombus, the symbol for Decision. The final symbol with the title "Done" is illustrated by something inbetween a circle and a rectangle. 

17:00 - 17:15    
We realised in our undertaking we have to jump into an endo perspective and get more familiar with the task of flow chart drawing. For this flow chart we decided to go with the elevator to the 1st floor in the perspective of the elevator. To achieve this task we agreed to do field research and go to the 1st floor by elevator for real. Some of us used this opportunity to smoke a cigarette and to elaborate on the experience of the elevator. The final goal is the create a flow chart based on our observations, but we are going to do this tomorrow.

17:15 - 17:40    
To round off the day we ended on some general reflections. It seems that the different interpretations of symbols have been integrated in the early flowcharts of the 1920's until now [^]{http://odec.ca/projects/2009/xing9t2/hist.htm}. To put this knowledge into practice we started to sketch out the flowchart on the wall using post-its.

Current research goals:

Flowchart or intervention: what is it like to be a elevator

zenit browser extension

iconographic analyses of flow chart symbols

call-flow && zenit modeling template for the drop-in clinic interview

Saturday:    
11:00 - 11:40    
We updated our research follower about our undertakings.

14:45-18:00    
Zenit (h)modeling/analysis    
A method derived from a removal of textual informating from flowcharts - related to previous work with [Zenit: International Review of Arts and Culture](https://monoskop.org/Zenit) created by Ljubomir Micic, founder of Zenitism (Zenitizam ) an early 20th Century movement and zenith - an imaginary point directly "above" a particular location, on [the imaginary celestial sphere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zenith).

**How to create browser add on /or browser extension:**    

1. Make a new dir at your local machine lets called it adds-on & and a folder called icons
2. Make an icon for your browser extension
3. Open text editor and copy paste this jason code 
4. You will need to modify the last two lines to point to the etherbox.local & css to poit to the extension.css
5. Make an css script place your css there 

On the browser:

1. Go to extension      
2. Load debugger from `about:debugging`
3. Load your extension
