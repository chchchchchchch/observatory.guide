% METHOD: Bug reporting for sharing observations

% REMEMBER:

% WHAT: Etherpad had stopped working but it was unclear why. Where does etherpad 'live'?
% HOW: Started by looking around the pi's filesystem by reading `/var/log/syslog`  in `/opt/etherpad` and in a subdirectory named `var/` there was `dirty.db`, and dirty it was.   
% WHEN: Monday morning
% WHO:
% URGENCY: Software (etherpad) not working and the Walk-in Clinic was about to start.
