% METHOD: Searching "software" through software
% WHAT: A quick way to sense the ambiguity of the term "software" is to go through the manual files on your hard drive and observe the cases in which the term is used.
% HOW: Command-line oneliner
% WHY: Software is a polysemous term that takes on different meanings depending on where, when and by who it is summoned. It comes with different assumptions for the different agents involved in its production, and for those whom otherwise use, encounter, or are subjected to it in any way or form. From the situated point of view of the software present on your machine, when and why does software call itself by that name. 

% EXAMPLE: - 

So software exists only outside your computer?
Only in general terms?
Checking for the word software in all manual pages:     

    grep -nr software /usr/local/man
    !!!!     

Software appears only in terms of license:      
   
    This program is free software
    This software is copyright (c)
    
We don't run software. We still run programs.     
Nevertheless software is everywhere.
