% METHOD: Searching "software" through software
% WHAT: A quick way to sense the ambiguity of the term "software" is to go through the manual files on your hard drive and observe the cases in which the term is used.
% HOW: Command-line oneliner
% WHY: Software is a polymorphic (% CARLINSAYS: can we use polysemous here instead? polymorphic means many shaped rather than many meanings) term that takes on different meanings and comes with different assumptions for the different agents involved in its production, use, and all other forms of encounter and subjection. (% CARLINSAYS: the end of this sentence "and all other forms of encounter and subjection" doesn't really fit/work. Can we say "...and comes with different assumptions for the different agents involved in its production and use and for those who encounter or are subjected to software in any other way or form." Or some other reworking?) From the situated point of view of the software present on your machine, when and why does software call itself by name?

% EXAMPLE: - 

So software exists only outside your computer?
Only in general terms?
Checking for the word software in all manual pages:     

    grep -nr software /usr/local/man
    !!!!     

Software appears only in terms of license:      
   
    This program is free software
    This software is copyright (c)
    
We don't run software. We still run programs.     
Nevertheless software is everywhere.
