FINISHING THE GUIDE [planning made + e-mailed 09/02]

In the coming weeks, Carlin will be editing. She'll either edit or use comments, % CARLINSAYS:
In the first week of March, she'll send an e-mail to say she's ready ;-)
At that time, Christoph will have produced a final pdf as well.
After that, reponses and fixing, deadline: 23 March
Final pdf, check and print April 1! not a joke.

9 JANUARY MEETING

TO DO BEFORE 9 FEBRUARY

Christoph: Style guide, new pdf
Christoph: take care of backup
Femke SEND EMAIL BEFORE THE WEEKEND WITH MESSY PDF
Carlin + Seda see if they can do something for the intro (Femke maybe joins/looks over [will do!])
Anita sends editors a proposal for punchcards, afterwards add on-line
Martino + Femke + Anita (rescue, also): intros, 14h CET 31/01
Martino re-ask Hans
All: go through methods we started/adopted
[Carlin rereads Peggy's transcription]

--

Agenda for tonight meeting: 
THE INTERNATIONAL MEETING
- See what still needs to be done
- Send out e-mail to TGSO list: deadline 29 January

Meet here at 20h CET https://meet.jit.si/observatory

Editing
Carlin has been reading, working on some items. Editing glossary.
Question: what about this warning:
http://pad.constantvzw.org/p/observatory.guide.warning -- it is a meta-warning that should go first? (now under the essentials)
She Does Not Feel Lost.
What scale of conversation? Intro could do with some tweaking, but in general works.
Read through half of the methods. Feels familiar. Need to hand it to interested people that were not at the workshop.
Send this to people that were at TGSO first.
Likes the mix: Conversational and some more 'technical'.

Seda also had a look -- some things to add and remove ... introduction (stops with freelancer-utopia, but what about turkers, clickworkers, on-line task workers ...)
Might need something on services in the clinic description. Some humor!
In general: we could be funnier and more surreal! Funny + sharp. Could use some edge. "We cannot be funny with software right now"
Databases of populations (El Salvadoreans about to be deported, India's biometric database being sold to journalists etc)
Emergency ... games of words. Needs some push.
Continuous integration missing from html?

https://pad.constantvzw.org/p/observatory.guide.introduction
Tension in the introduction. First: critical distance, then entanglement. Need to name it/connect it. Helps to tie in the quote?
Later: "going beyond" ... MMo -- need to reformulate. Make quote (why it is there) more xplicit.
Distance can be critical but not always. 


Work a bit more on the introduction, this can work on its own?
So the text should be a text to be read that stands on its own and does work on its own. 
Maybe the introduction needs to be more explicitly political.

Seda looked for methods -- there are some missing. Christoph will make them appear!
Also: if we open to others, they will bring new energy.
Calendar App Collapsing!
Peggy: we can do this on the 9th? Or maybe not. 
Seda: separate time for sharpening the introduction, to keep serioussnes and humor together.

Cluster descriptions not done yet/not in the html. Should we write them or use quotes?
Some Humor Can Go Here.
Needs writing -- we tried using quotes only, but it does not work for all.

http://pad.constantvzw.org/p/observatory.guide.grouping.temporality
http://pad.constantvzw.org/p/observatory.guide.grouping.languaging
illustrations to open the groupings
Works well with the design! So, make mixes of images/quotes and some writing.
Carlin: it does not need to be a lot ... one or two words. Titles already do a lot.

Appendix
Peggy has done the interview and will do the transciption by next week
Meeting was very nice! New stories added. Anecdotes.
(CH: what about the interview, where/how to put it?)
Let's just put it into the https://pad.constantvzw.org/p/observatory.guide.jean.heuns pad
don't mind the formatting right now.
An hour of conversation. Keeping all of it? An excerpt? Use extracts through the quide.
Decide on the 9th of February 2018 ?
Peggy will do the transcription anyways. CH + FS think it could work well, different pace.

What other extra materials could go in an Appendix?
the full interview Peggy did
Jogi's email
What else?
Hans text on time: wanted to work on the text -- finished by 9th of February
Anita: wrote on punchcards, needs to be finished ... a short version would be nice!!

Christoph advanced on processing the pads:
Christoph is "pretty fine"

different parts, different treatments. Now very basic.

http://observatory.constantvzw.org/tgsoguide.html
http://observatory.constantvzw.org/
-> tgsoguide_1801091008.pdf

To get an overview regarding the current state of editing the html output works better as the pdf requires more work on the details and layout, which still needs to be done. To keep track of things to be done I added a temporary '% TODO:' 

FYI: http://gitlab.constantvzw.org/ch/observatory.guide

Tech question: intake form ... could we link it, how does it work? How to integrate documents (like pdfs)?
write in your pad ...
% TODO: include pdf here linktothepdf
and CH will look :-)

Including other TGSO people: an email!
- specific questions
- general call
- make little howto (until next week?)
- make a back-up of the current version before the email goes out to the larger group

Subject: Call for contributions TGSO guide (deadline 29/1)

Dear all,

It has been a while since we ended the Walk-in clinic with agile yoga! In the mean time, Anita, Martino, Carlin, Peggy, Seda, Michael, Femke have been joined by Christoph to work on The Guide To Techno-Galactic Software Observation.

We have been trying to put together a collection that works both as a documentation of the session and as a /new/ publication. As part of this we have created a list of methods for software observation that are drawn from the worksession documentation. We chose to show the materials in terms of methods for observation, hoping this loose frame can welcome irony and bending.
While we are trying to reach some density and coherence, the guide does not aim for completeness. Rather we hope to give an impression of the variety of tones and materials that were manifested during our 6 days together. Now that there is some basic structure for the guide, we would like to invite you, our fellow observers, to add materials and/or add methods you feel must be in THE guide to techno-galactic software observation!

Here is a first pdf: [LINK HERE]. 
You can find the live index to all methods so far: 
    http://pad.constantvzw.org/p/observatory.guide
    There is some markup added for generating the guide directly from pads, obviously. A few of the things missing from this pdf: A transcription from an interview with Jean Huens (Peggy), Hans' text on time, Anita contribution on punchcards. And a thousand other small things.

You are welcome to update/complete/correct existing items or to add new ones. Some examples of more or less 'complete' methods that you can copy from: 
    https://pad.constantvzw.org/p/observatory.guide.agile.yoga , 
    https://pad.constantvzw.org/p/observatory.guide.somethinginthemiddlemaybe , 
    https://pad.constantvzw.org/p/observatory.guide.visit , 
    https://pad.constantvzw.org/p/observatory.guide.monopsychism

Style guide below!

If you would like to make use of the notes from the worksession, you can find the pages indexed here: 
    http://observatory.constantvzw.org/etherdump/_new_index.html

We have only a short window of time to put this together so that we can meet the publication deadline. The deadline for your contributions is January 29

If you want to commit to a contribution, or have questions, or comments, please send an e-mail to the mailinglist [observatory@lists.constantvzw.org] in the coming days so we can all coordinate.

The Techno-Galactic Software Observation Guide is generated from etherpads and uses an extended
dialect of markdown. The markup vocabulary is meant to develop during the editing process.
Next to classic markdown ( http://lfkn.de/md )
you may write `instruction lines` that tell the translator about the
desired output. An `instruction line` starts with `%` and takes
everything after the first colon as input, e.g.:

% SUPERLARGETEXT: Something all should know

will insert 'Something all should know' using whatever is considered
a superlarge textsize.


EDITORIAL INSTRUCTIONS
====================

Instructions are part of the editorial template developed to structure the content of the guide.

% METHOD: sum up the method

The main description of the software observation method

% WHAT: what it is
% WHEN: when it was
% WHO:  who has done it
% WHY:  the big question
% HOW:  how to do it
% URGENCY: why it is urgent
% WARNING: what to beware of
% REMEMBER: never forget
% NOTE: a note is a note is a note
% EXAMPLE: real or not so real world example
% RELATESTO: http://link/to/another/pad

Standard descriptors of the method.
Somehow self-explanatory?

Empty descriptors will be ignored. To force an empty
descriptor, maybe as a headline, if the content requires
more space, use a dash e.g.

% EXAMPLE: - 

===========

Descriptors used to add methods to the index
https://pad.constantvzw.org/p/observatory.guide

% SEEHERE: http://link/to/another/pad
% SEEALSO: http://link/to/another/pad

% SEEHERE will directly include a document.
% SEEALSO will put a reference.

===========

To mark up sections you can use separators `% ------` e.g.

% -----------

 tac ${TMPID}.part |
 grep -nE "^% [-]{4,} *$" |
 head -n 1 | cut -d ":" -f 1

% BASHCODE:

will display the section between the command
and the separator as bash source code.

At the moment there exist following section markups:

% BASHCODE:     <- Bourne-Again Source Code
% VERBATIM:     <- Includes Text as it is in a mono-spaced font.
                   No linebreaks -> long lines (>80c) will overshoot
% VERBATIMWRAP: <- same as verbatim but does linebreaks.

For requests see 'FUTURE INSTRUCTIONS'



FUTURE INSTRUCTIONS
===================

If you have an idea about some instruction that should be added,
you may write a `% TODO:` instruction as a request for future implementation e.g.

% TODO: include pdf here: http://linktopdf
% TODO: gigantic exclamation mark here
% TODO: draw a box with 'some warning'


Current instruction set to be found here:
https://gitlab.constantvzw.org/ch/observatory.guide/blob/master/E/tgsoguide.functions

---

Carlin's questions
- editing process
*- different approach for primary materials (taken from workshop) vs framing materials created now
*- in order to respect the documentation of the primary material (michael)
*- how can this be a document that oscillates between "look what cool methods we used and "here are some things you could try out yourself"
"If you are writing, you have liberties" - if necessary, ask people who were involved in the thing to 
- order of entries
http://pad.constantvzw.org/p/observatory.guide
- incorporation of photographs, diagrams, etc
YES!
- small note (visit computer collections appears twice in the current html)
(probably ok now?)

look for phrases / ways for introducing the chapters/groupings. Could be just a line? A task for someone?
Test: http://pad.constantvzw.org/p/observatory.guide.grouping.temporality

Introduction http://pad.constantvzw.org/p/observatory.guide.introduction Peggy + FS + Seda first round

Add reference to the walk-in clinic? A description. Unlike normal guides: we have not removed the process. WARNING: there will be a mix of abstractions and concrete experiences.

Carlin works on 3 entries

The interview needs to be done -> Peggy

Hans e-mail -> Martino
Ana + Ricardo -> Femke

For each of the chapter descriptions: quote from the materials/reader? Could be an image. Or a short inspirational phrase? -> Martino tries
http://pad.constantvzw.org/p/observatory.guide

An email to other TGSO participants, call for help/see if further material is available (once the PDF is more stable)

WARNING: pad fatigue might occur

latex todo:
* be able to force empty new lines  (f.ex to put back lines in scrollresistance)
* differentiate code quotes from pad quotes





SAS Survival Handbook: The Ultimate Guide to Surviving Anywhere 
https://archive.org/stream/SASSurvivalHandbookTheUltimateGuideToSurvivingAnywhere/AppNee.com.SAS.Survival.Handbook.2nd.Edition#page/n359/mode/2up
The  Rudiments Of Wisdom encyclopaedia by Tim Hunkin.
http://www.rudimentsofwisdom.com

issue: different materials. works well to situate the week. fr an interview, a good way to introduce. but with folders, code ... so brought the SAS guide. What is good about that it is very loose ... different layers, zooms ... 
flowing things from one into the other .. not too formulaic. find ways to jump different tones.
multiplicity of tones. so ... something in-between the two

template as a way to make the connection back to the original questions ... what are the things to pay attention to, to give space to it.

we did not do any grouping, but maybe that could be interesting to try?

we were testing observatory method, the chronological order to prevent us from paying too much attention to the clinic and would also look at the exercises and thinking from the first days. 

could each method then propose its form/content?

even to have chapters that have no entry or only an introduction and no methods, to play the templating without feeling that we have to fulfil that template 

http://observatory.constantvzw.org/documents/mia/mia6.gif

noise is back,

test: make a round of groupings / hierarchies affinities
test: make more methods
test: other templates

seda wondering about us defining different types of participants: stationary (that's us), migratory (but some stayed), walk-in (visitors to the clinic), sedentary ... was that a method?
do all the methods need to be related to software? YES but WHAT IS SOFTWARE

sing through and to the hardware and software

what is the 'entrypoint'(element from inventory?)-method relation
methods as a way to label and address things, still keeping open to other materials to enter (ie interview..)

Everything in the guide is a METHOD, but how do we group and groom the methods???

Do we do a publication, an event .. the fact that we have been through an event, and even that we describe it, means we are developing the methods.<- is this like observation transforms the method!?
So: is this documentation, or will we open it to new input. Ongoing.

Difference between documentation and publication

Exampe: e-mail of jogi. 
That report is already published and structured? It is an easier ongoingness -- to accept other contrib

ongoingness? thinking it structured around the week, and its participants. if you have not been involved, it is difficult to understand?

Who is it for? Do we want it to be of use? The difference between documentation and publication is the imagined audience
documentation: audience is the participants, does not have the ambition to be legible to non-participants
publication: a broader audience (with contributions from other participants but not from those who did not participate in the work session) who would be able to pick it up and understand the techno-galactic condition


Can we decide on a few kinds of formats and test them
- one can be a breakdown like on the methods list
- one can be more just description/summary/exericse

we look at the methods
and other forms of documentation
see if the proposed structure works
specifically:
*test: make a round of groupings / hierarchies affinities
*test: make more methods
*test: other templates
*
7:20 CET back to discuss

Peggy:

For the interview ... something that could be easily done, short bio interview with 2-3 q to the participants. Easy to do, and a bit is already done in the introductions. Would be good to have it in the guide for people that have not been involved. Carlin likes this too!
P. still likes to do long interview with mr. Huens.
Would like to write down the visit to the museum as an 19th century explorer .

Martino: groupings can certainly work. It can work, and connections are interesting. Two ways to go through? -- going to the groupings now -- 

Templates
Groupings

Seda filled her own template ... now on line 116 .. "Testing the testbed"

Anita: liked the grouping. Tension between formal and conceptual groupings. 
In case of doubt, turn to the SAS survival handbook.

How will we get this done?
[[WARNING: This is epic and may take the rest of our lives.]]

2 days *full on* will intensively generate lot of material. 
where would we be after?
 what do we need before then?

Carlin joins Friday afternoon CET

Methods for (engaged) observation of software

An inclusive list of methods that appeared during the worksession. 
Question: are we validating if they are "interesting or even "engaged"? If the object is produced by the mode of observation. or what if the mode of observation is produced by the object ...
Are we producing a guide that we want to exist or producing a document of what happened (a bit of both?)
Name the things that we might otherwise take for granted.
How do we name what's different about software and observation across time, without rendering the new or the old into an ideal?
A quite litteral, chronological list: based on the week, based on the observations of/that were experimented with the week
*we follow the methods of observation day by day, session by session and list them. 
*follow the program, but all the different things that started to happen.
*Trying to stay chronological so we force ourselves to consider the different experiments/methods that happened.

[[warning: "our methods for observation, like mapping, come with their luggage." from Thursday afternoon section of http://observatory.constantvzw.org/etherdump/toc.md.diff.html ]]
[[warning: some of these methods are not suitable for agile software/SaaS observation]]

TEMPLATE FOR DESCRIBING PROPOSED METHODS:
*By: [who developed, tested, proposed this method]
*How: [ideas for how the observation method can be applied]
*Where/when: [in what situation, space, circumstances does the observation take place]
*What: [what/who gets observed. What software category does it apply to agile/SaaS?]
*Who: [who/what gets to observe]
*Why: [what is the engagement, of the observer with the observed and vice versa]
*Note: [anything that did not fit above.]
*Mode of engagement:

##BEFOREHAND

*Method: Prepare a reader to think theory with software
*By: [who developed, tested, proposed this method]
*How: [ideas for how the observation method can be applied]
*Where/when: [in what situation, space, circumstances does the observation take place]
*What: [what/who gets observed. What software category does it apply to agile/SaaS?]
*Who: [who/what gets to observe]
*Why: [what is the engagement, of the observer with the observed and vice versa]
*Note: [anything that did not fit above.]

*Method: Testing the testbed: testing software with observatory ambitions (SWOA)
*By/history/source/origin/process: the "original testbed" was proposed by researchers/collaborators in Princeton. Testing this testbed at a local Constant workshop led to the meta-project of testing software meant for testing software. 
*How: The interwebs hosts many projects that aim to produce software for observing software, (from now on Software With Observatory Ambitions (SWOA)). A comparative methodology can be produced by using different SWOA to observe software of interest. Example: use different sniffing software to observe wireless networks. Doing so reveals what is seen as worthy of observation (e.g., what protocols, what space, which devices), the granularity of the observation (e.g., how is the observation captured, in what detail), the logo and conceptual framework of choice etc. 
*Where/when/situation?: Ideally, SWOA can be used everywhere. In reality, institutions, laws and administrators like to control the use of SWOA on infrastructures not also run by the people running it. Hence, we get distinctions like researchers and pen testers (e.g., they were hired) vs. hackers. 
*What: Deep philosophical moment: most software has a recursive observatory ambition (it wants to be observed in its execution, output etc.). Debuggers, logs, dashboards are all instances of software with observatory ambitions and can not be separated from software itself. So, what separates SWOA from software itself? HELP! 
*Who/with: If you can run the SWOA (many of these are promises more than running software/available code), you can do it. The question is: will people like it if you observe their SWOA?
*Why/urgency/ [this is maybe related to the engagement question?]: If critical engagement in software is a thing, it follows that people would develop software to observe. 
*Note: [anything that did not fit above.]
*WARNING: 
*REMEMBER: Good SWOA software usually uses an animal as a logo.:D
*See also: making a bestiary of visual cultures/logos around it

*What: Could this be put together with the agile yoga and become something that explores different kinds of injuries, occupational therapy, etc?
*Why:
*Who: Users/workers
*Note: Etherbox observation by Becky (..."A familiar feeling hits me: a resignation to the fact that a lot of computing labor looks the same. People hunched in front of folding  objects, boring their eyes into an expanded universe invisible to the  observer.") http://observatory.constantvzw.org/etherdump/cargocultGalore.md.diff.html

Methods for inadequate observation of software?



I think about methods as ways of knowing. One way to handle the publication/documentation tension would be to structure a publication around a set of ways of knowing/methods and then select and shape documentation from the worksession as samples of these methods or taking moments from the workshop as prompts for reflection on these methods. Some of the play would come in from the mix of recognizable and common methods (visit a museum (ie. Namur and Leuven), conduct interviews (ie. with Jean Heuns but also as Relational software observatory consultancy service), organize and hold a worksession (ie. what we did), listen to an expert (ie. sidechannel)) with the less common ones (ie. create a bestiary of software logos, engaging with code through collective reading/performance, etc).

but then the things in these groupings can be arranged/divided by form? like descrptive entries/ exercises/ diagrams/ conversation with/ gloss/

WARNINGS
[[warning: "our methods for observation, like mapping, come with their luggage." from Thursday afternoon section of http://observatory.constantvzw.org/etherdump/toc.md.diff.html ]]
[[warning: some of these methods are not suitable for agile software/SaaS observation]]
