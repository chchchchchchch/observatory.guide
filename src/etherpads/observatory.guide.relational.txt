% METHOD: Setup a Relational Software Observatory Consultancy (RSOC)
% WHAT: Ethnomethodological interviews.

% HOW: Read the signs. Considering the ever changing nature of software development and use, and its vast impact on globalized societies, it is necessary to recognize that the problems arising from software are often either passively-perceived or actively-observed without an articulation of the relations. Reading the signs of the relational aspect of software observance will give you another view on software that will shape your ability to survive any kind of software disaster.



% ![Reading the signs. From: John "Lofty" Wiseman, SAS Survival Handbook: The Ultimate Guide to Surviving Anywhere]( http://gallery.constantvzw.org/index.php/Techno-Galactic-Software-Observatory/IMAG1319 )
% URGENCY: - 

* Collectivise research around hacking to save time.
* Self-articulate software needs as your own Operating (system) perspective.
* Change the lens by looking at software with a time-based perspective.

% WHEN:
% WHO:  A practitioner who can facilitate the "what is our relation to software" discussion and administer the RSOC interview as a service.

## What to expect

Through administration of this questionnaire, you will obtain a cartographic view of software users profiles. It will help you to shape your own relation to software. You will be able to construct your own taxonomy and classification of software users which is necessary in order to find a means of rescue in case of a software catastrophe. 

### User Habits
* What kind of user would you say that you are? 
* What is your most frequently used type of software?
* How often do you install/experiment/learn new software?

### History
* What is your first recollection of software use? 
* How often do/when did you last purchase software or pay for a software service?

### Ethics 
* What is the software feature you care about the most?
* Do you use any free software?    
  If yes than
		*  do you remember your first attempt at using this software service? Do you still use it? If not why? 
* Do you pay for media distribution/streaming services?
* Do you remember your first attempt at using free software and how did that make you feel?
* Have you used any of these software services: Facebook, dating apps (Grindr, Tinder, etc.), Twitter, Instagram or equivalent. 
* Can you talk about your favorite apps or webtools that you use regularly?
*  What is most popular software your friends use?

### Skill
* Would you say that you are a specilised user? 
*  Have you ever used the command line? 
*  Do you know about scripting? 
*  Have you ever edited an HTML page? A CSS file? A PHP file? A configuration file?

   * What is the last software that you paid for using? 
   * What online services are you currently paying for?
   * Is someone paying for your use of service?

% ROLEPLAY, SAMPLES OF ANSWERS:



## Possible/anticipated user profiles

% MEAS: HardwareOwnerSoftwareUSER
I did not own a computer personally until very very late as I did not enjoy gaming as a kid and had no interest in spending much time behind a PC beyond work (and work computer). My first experience was hence I think in 2005 and it was a SGI workstation that was the computer of the year 2000 (cost 10.000USD)  and I got it for around 300USD. Proprietary drivers for unified graphics+RAM were never released, so it remained a software dead-end in gorgeous blue curved chassis http://www.sgidepot.co.uk/sgidepot/pics/vwdocs.jpg

% MEAS: SoftwareCONSUMER
I payed/purchased  software only twice in my life (totalling less then 25eur), as I could access most commercial software as widely pirated in Balkans and later had more  passion for FLOSS anyway, this made me relate to software as material to  exchange and work with, rather than commodity goods I could or could not afford.

% MEAS: SoftwareINVESTOR
I did it as both of those apps  were niche products in early beta (one was Jeeper Elvis, real-time-non-linear-video-editor for BeOS) that failed to reach market,  but I think I would likely do it again and only in that mode  (supporting the bleeding edge and off-stream work), but maybe with more than 25eur.

% MEAS: SoftwareUserOfOS
I would spend most of 80s ignoring computers, 90s figuring out software from high-end to low-end, starting with OSF/DecAlpha and SunOS, than IRIX and MacOS, finally Win 95/98 SE, that permanently pushed me into niches (of montly LINUX distro install fests, or even QNX/Solaris experiments and finally BeOS use).

% MEAS: SoftwareWEBSURFER
I got used to websurfing in more than 15 windows on UNIX systems and never got used to less than that ever since, furthermore with addition of more browser options this  number only multiplied (always wondered if my first system was Windows  3.11 - would I be a more focused person and how would that form my relations to browser windows>tabs).

% MEAS: SoftwareUserOfProprietarySoftware
I signed one NDA contract in person on the paper and with ink on a  rainy day while stopping of at train station in northern Germany for the software that was later to be pulled out of market due to problematic licensing agreement (intuitively I knew it was wrong) - it had too much unprofessional pixeleted edges in its graphics.

% MEAS: SoftwareUserOfDatingWebsites
I got one feature request implemented by a prominent dating website (to search profiles by language they speak), however I was never publicly acknowledged (though I tried to make use of it few times), that made our relations feel a bit exploitative and underappreciated.

% MEAS: SoftwareUserTryingToGoPRO
My only two attempts to get into a software company failed as they insisted on full time commitments. Later I found out one was intimidated in the interview and the other gave it to a person that negotiated to work part time with a friend! My relation to professionalism is likely equally complex and perverted as my one to the software.

## Case study : W. W.

% WWAS: ExperiencedAdventurousUSER: Experiments with software every two days as she uses FLOSS and GNU/Linux, cares the most for malleability of the software - as a result she has big expectations of flexibility even in software category which is quite conventional and stability focused like file-hosting. 

% WWAS: AnInvestorInSoftware: Paid for a compiled version of FLOSS audio software 5 years ago as she is supportive of economy and work around production, maintainance and support, but she also used closed hardware/software where she had to agree on licences she finds unfair, but then she was hacking it in order to use it as an expert - when she had time.  

% WWAS: CommunicationSoftwareUSER: She is not using commercial social networks, so she is very conscious of information transfers and time relations, but has no strong media/format/design focus.

% Q: Do you know about scripting?  
% A: I do automating scripts for any operation I have to doi several times like format conversion.

% Q: Can you talk about your most technical encounter with your computer/telephone?

% Q: How does software help you shape your relations with other people?  
% A: It's a hard question. If it's communication software of course it's its nature to be related to other people. There is an expectency of immediate reply, of information transfer... It's troubling your relation with people in certain situations.

% Q: From which countries does your softwares live/is coming from? How do you feel about that?
