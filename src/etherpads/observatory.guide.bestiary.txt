% METHOD: Compiling a bestiary of software logos

% REMEMBER:
% WHAT: The visual culture of software has relied heavily on animal representations since the early days of GNU/Linux. This tendency was cemented into a tradition through the line-drawings used on the covers of the ubiquitous [O'Reilly publications](http://animals.oreilly.com/browse). What actors are populating the realm of software observation, and to what effect?

% HOW: -
Compile a collection of logos and note the metaphors for observation and their surrounding vocabularies. How are different relations between observers and objects of observation established through a combination of vocabularies and images?

This Bestiary was initiated during _Testing the testbed_, a two-day workshop intended to critically evaluate the _Internet of Things (IoT) Inspector_, a testsuite for embedded devices proposed by the Princeton University’s Center for Information Technology and Policy (CITP). Participants from Constant, Dyne:BXL, COSIC Leuven and others gathered to test the testbed with the help of their cameras, smartphones, and other "things". As we compared different hard- and software set-ups for observing dataflows in IoT environments, we noticed that many of them were represented by animals and other agents with human traits that would perform the job of looking, analysing, inspecting and investigating. Here, we have expanded the initial collection to address network observation in general. What does it mean to "look" at the activity in a computer network? Who or what is looking and in what way?

"Dowse is a transparent proxy facilitating the awareness of ingoing and outgoing connections, from, to, and within a local area network. Dowse provides a central point of soft control for all local traffic: from ARP traffic (layer 2) to TCP/IP (layers 3 and 4) as well as application space, by chaining a firewall setup to a transparent proxy setup. A core feature for Dowse is that of hiding all the complexity of such a setup."

"Hovelbot is a computer program that, just like Frankenstein’s monster, quietly observes how humans live, in order to learn and be able to share its stories with them. The visitor is asked to connect her phone to a local network. By doing so, the visitor can observe how the hidden activity happening on her device is giving form to Hovelbot. In turn, Hovelbot takes its unintentional “teachers” on a journey that, even though it might remind us of the 19th century romantic pursues, will rather be a confrontation between our networked self and the artificial beings that make this network."

"As soon as you’re connected to the Internet, applications can potentially send whatever they want to wherever they want. Most often they do this to your benefit. But sometimes, like in case of tracking software, trojans or other malware, they don’t. But you don’t notice anything, because all of this happens invisibly under the hood. Little Snitch makes these Internet connections visible and puts you back in control!"

"Netflix is pleased to announce the open source release of Stethoscope, our first project following a User Focused Security approach. The notion of _User Focused Security_ acknowledges that attacks against corporate users (e.g., phishing, malware) are the primary mechanism leading to security incidents and data breaches, and it’s one of the core principles driving our approach to corporate information security. It’s also reflective of our philosophy that tools are only effective when they consider the true context of people’s work.
Stethoscope is a web application that collects information for a given user’s devices and gives them clear and specific recommendations for securing their systems. If we provide employees with focused, actionable information and low-friction tools, we believe they can get their devices into a more secure state without heavy-handed policy enforcement."

It lets you see what’s happening on your network at a microscopic level and is the de facto (and often de jure) standard across many commercial and non-profit enterprises, government  agencies, and educational institutions. Wireshark development thrives thanks to the volunteer contributions of networking experts around the  globe and is the continuation of a project started by Gerald Combs in 1998."
