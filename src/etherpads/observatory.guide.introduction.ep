Where and when is software made today?\n\n%!SHOW: tgsoimages.svg tgsoview N\n\n% Let's have one page with more images\n% http://gallery.constantvzw.org/index.php/Techno-Galactic-Software-Observatory/IMAG1399\n% SHOW: tgsoimages.svg scppath\n% INFO: Documenting the path of a Software Curious Person going through the Walk-in Clinic\n\n## The Walk-in Clinic\n\nThe last two days at the Techno-galactic software observatory were dedicated to observation and its consequences. The development of software encompasses a series of practices whose evocative names are increasingly familiar: feedback, report, probe, audit, inspect, scan, diagnose, explore, test ... What are the systems of knowledge and power within which these activities take place, and what other types of observation are possible? As a practical set for our investigations, we set up a walk-in clinic on the 25th floor of the World Trade Center, where users and developers could arrive with software-questions of all kinds.\n\n> Do you suffer from the disappearance of your software into the cloud,\n> feel oppressed by unequal user privilege, or experience the torment of\n> software-ransom of any sort?\n> Bring your devices and interfaces to the World Trade Center!\n> With the help of a clear and in-depth session, at the Techno-Galactic\n> Walk-In Clinic we guarantee immediate results.\n> The  Walk-In Clinic provides free hands-on observations to software\n> curious  people of all kinds. A wide range of professional and amateur \n> practitioners will provide you with Software-as-a-Critique-as-a-Service\n> on the spot. Available services range from immediate interface critique, \n> collaborative code inspection, data dowsing, various forms of network\n> analyses, unusability testing, identification of unknown viruses,\n> risk assessment, opening of black-boxes and more.\n> Free software observations provided.\n> Last intake at 16:45.\n> [^]{Invitation to the Walk-In Clinic, June 2017}\n\n% On the following

observation\n==========================================\n\n> I am less interested in the critical practice of reflection, of showing once-again\n> that the emperor has no clothes, than in finding a way to _diffract_ critical inquiry\n> in order to make difference patterns in a more worldly way.\n> [@haraway:1996:witness]\n% p429, Haraway, modest witness, 1996 from: http://observatory.constantvzw.org/etherdump/friday.md.diff.html\n\n\nA spectre is haunting the galaxy. No matter where you happen to be, if you are looking at the worlds around you, there is software running somewhere in the background. Look! There it is, looking right back at you. Be it your phone screen or a passing satellite, software's observation feels complete. Or, is it? The techno-galactic software survival guide that you are reading right now turns this image of a totally observed world on its head, and sticks it into a self-reflecting elevator. It is the ultimate book of dos and do nots, of mindful agile presence, of forgotten histories and un-inevitable futures, of improv service architectures and all that you can and cannot imagine you need in a techno-galaxy. Reading is not enough, computing is \n\nWith the rise of online services, the use of software has increasingly been knitted into the production of software, even while the rhetoric, rights and procedures continue to suggest that use and production constitute separate realms. This knitting together and its corresponding disavowal has an effect on the way software is used and produced that radically alters its operative role in society. The shifts ripple across galaxies, through social structures, working conditions and personal relations, resulting in a profusion of apparatuses aspiring to be seamless while optimizing and monetizing individual and collective flows of information in line with the interests of a handful of actors. The diffusion of software services affects the personal, in the form of intensified identity shaping and self-management. It also affects the public, as more and more libraries, universities and public infrastructures as well as the management of public life rely on \"solutions\" provided by private companies. Centralizing data flows in the clouds, services blur the last traces of the thin line that separates bio- from necro-politics.\n\nGiven how fast these changes resonate and reproduce, there is a growing urgency to engage in a critique of software that goes beyond taking a distance, and that deals with the fact that we are inevitably already entangled. How can we interact, intervene, respond and think with software? What approaches can allow us to recognize the agency of different actors, their ways of functioning and their politics? What methods of observation enable critical inquiry and affirmative discord? What techniques can we apply to resurface software where it has melted into the infrastructure and into the everyday? How can we remember that software is always at work, especially where it is designed to disappear into the background?\n\nWe pick up the word \"observation\", turning it over and around. We bring it right up to our noses and hold it outstretched to get a better look, holding all of the histories of people looking at other people in mind, holding terminals and keyboards in hand. We regard observation as a way to approach software, as one way to organize engagement with its implications. Observation, and the enabling of it through intensive data-centric feedback mechanisms, is part of  the cybernetic principles that underpin present day software production. Our aim was to scrutinize this methodology in its many manifestations, including in \"observatories\" -- high cost infrastructures of observation troubled by colonial, imperial, empirical traditions and their problematic divisions of nature and culture. And through scrutiny, we hope to open up a set of questions about who gets to observe software (and how) and who is being observed by software (and with what impact)? It is a question of power, one that we answer, at least in part, with critical play. But also with slow pedagogy.\n\nor:\n\nTogether we picked up the word \"observation\", turning it over and around. We brought it right up to our noses and held it outstretched to get a better look, holding all of the histories of people looking at other people in mind, holding terminals and keyboards in hand. We regarded observation as a way to approach software, as one way to organize engagement with its implications. Observation, and the enabling of it through intensive data-centric feedback mechanisms, is part of  the cybernetic principles that underpin present day software production.\n\n\nWe are techno-galactic as we meet the contemporary paradigms of computation that proudly announce their capability for \"scaling up to the universe.\" We stand here as modest witnesses to the scales of software communities and related political economies that involve and require observation.\n\nThis guide offers a set of practical and fantastical tools for the tactical (mis)use of software, empowering/enabling users to resist embedded paradigms and assumptions. It is a collection of methods for approaching software, experiencing its myths and realities, its risks and benefits. Drawing on theories of software and computation developed in academia and elsewhere, we grounded our methods in hands-on exercises and experiments that you now can try at home. This Guide to Techno-Galactic Software Observation offers methods developed in and inspired by the context of software production, hacker culture, software studies, computer science research, Free Software communities, privacy activism, and artistic practice. It invites you to experiment with ways to stay with the trouble of software. Come join us at the edge of the universe, on the metro platform, at your kitchen table, as we mark and measure critical distances from and entanglements with the seemingly endless software systems that surround us.\n\nThe techno-galactic software survival guide was collectively produced as an outcome of the Techno-Galactic Software Observatory. \n[This feels like it could be in a different font size or in brackets or is the start of the next page/spread?]\n\n\nRemaining thoughts/notes for inspiration:\nYou may want to just throw all your devices away, but before you do so, wouldn't you want to, for once poke them back?\nYou may think about retreating to a natural reserve, and live a software free life, but even then, do you think you could manage without talking about your past software troubles.\nAnd, how about those drawings at the nearby cave, that look eerily similar to an ancient flowchart, you think you can just ignore its poetry?\n\n% http://observatory.constantvzw.org/images/friday/P1010328.JPG\n% SHOW: tgsoimages.svg tgsoteam N\n% INFO: Techno-Galactic Software Observation team, WTC Brussels, June 2017\n\n## The Techno-Galactic Software Observatory\n\nIn the summer of 2017, around thirty people gathered in Brussels to explore practices of proximate critique with and of software in the context of a worksession entitled \"Techno-Galactic Software Observatory\".[^]{Worksessions are intensive transdisciplinary moments, organised twice a year by Constant. They aim to provide conditions for participants with different experiences and capabilities to temporarily link their practice and to  develop ideas, prototypes and  research projects together. For the worksessions, primarily Free, Libre and Open Source software is used and material that is available under Open Content Licenses.} The worksession called for software-curious people of all kinds to ask questions about software. The intuition behind such a call was that different types of engagement requires a heterogeneous group of participants with different levels of expertise,  skill and background. During three sessions of two days, participants collectively inspected the space-time of computation and probed the universe of hardware-software separations through excursions, exercises and conversations. They tried out various perspectives and methods to look at the larger picture of software as a concept, as a practice, and as a set of techniques.\n\nThe first two days of The Techno-Galactic Software Observatory included visits to the Musée de l'Informatique Pionnière en Belgique [^]{http://www.nam-ip.be} in Namur and the Computermuseum KULeuven[^]{http://www.etwie.be/database/actor/computermuseum-ku-leuven}. In the surroundings of these collections of historical ’numerical artefacts’, we started viewing software in a long-term context. It was an occasion to reflect on the conditions of its appearance, and allowed us to take on current-day questions from a genealogical perspective. What is software? How did it appear as a concept, in what industrial and governmental circumstances? What happens to the material conditions of its production (minerals, factory labor, hardware) when it evaporates into a cloud?\n\nThe second two days we focused on the space-time dimension of IT development. The way computer programs and operating systems are manufactured changed tremendously through time, and so did its production times and places. From military labs via the mega-corporation cubicles to the open-space freelancer utopia, what ruptures and continuities can be traced in the production, deployment, maintenance and destruction of software? From time-sharing to user-space partitions and containerization, what separations were and are at work? Where and when is software made today?\n\n%!SHOW: tgsoimages.svg tgsoview N\n\n% Let's have one page with more images\n% http://gallery.constantvzw.org/index.php/Techno-Galactic-Software-Observatory/IMAG1399\n% SHOW: tgsoimages.svg scppath\n% INFO: Documenting the path of a Software Curious Person going through the Walk-in Clinic\n\n## The Walk-in Clinic\n\nThe last two days at the Techno-galactic software observatory were dedicated to observation and its consequences. The development of software encompasses a series of practices whose evocative names are increasingly familiar: feedback, report, probe, audit, inspect, scan, diagnose, explore, test ... What are the systems of knowledge and power within which these activities take place, and what other types of observation are possible? As a practical set for our investigations, we set up a walk-in clinic on the 25th floor of the World Trade Center, where users and developers could arrive with software-questions of all kinds.\n\n> Do you suffer from the disappearance of your software into the cloud,\n> feel oppressed by unequal user privilege, or experience the torment of\n> software-ransom of any sort?\n> Bring your devices and interfaces to the World Trade Center!\n> With the help of a clear and in-depth session, at the Techno-Galactic\n> Walk-In Clinic we guarantee immediate results.\n> The  Walk-In Clinic provides free hands-on observations to software\n> curious  people of all kinds.

observation\n==========================================\n\n> I am less interested in the critical practice of reflection, of showing once-again\n> that the emperor has no clothes, than in finding a way to _diffract_ critical inquiry\n> in order to make difference patterns in a more worldly way.\n> [@haraway:1996:witness]\n% p429, Haraway, modest witness, 1996 from: http://observatory.constantvzw.org/etherdump/friday.md.diff.html\n\n\nA spectre is haunting the galaxy. No matter where you happen to be, if you are looking at the worlds around you, there is software running somewhere in the background. Look! There it is, looking right back at you. Be it your phone screen or a passing satellite, software's observation and entangelements in the everyday feel complete. But, i? The techno-galactic software survival guide that you are reading right now turns this image of a totally observed world driven by an obsessive fantasy of optimization on its head, and sticks it into a self-reflecting elevator. It is the ultimate book of dos and do nots, of mindful agile presence, of forgotten histories and un-inevitable futures, of improv service architectures and all that you can and cannot imagine you need in a techno-galaxy. Reading is not enough, engagement is invited, software is not text...\n\nWith the rediscovery of online services in the 90s, the use of software has increasingly been knitted into the production of software, even while the rhetoric, rights and procedures continue to suggest that use and production constitute separate realms. This knitting together and its corresponding disavowal has an effect on the way software is used and produced that radically alters its operative role in society. The shifts ripple across galaxies, through social structures, working conditions and personal relations, resulting in a profusion of apparatuses aspiring to be seamless while optimizing and monetizing individual and collective flows of information in line with the interests of a handful of actors. The diffusion of software services affects the personal, in the form of intensified identity shaping and self-management. It also affects the public, as more and more libraries, universities and public infrastructures as well as the management of public life rely on \"solutions\" provided by private companies. Centralizing data flows in the clouds, services blur the last traces of the thin line that separates bio- from necro-politics.\n\nGiven how fast these changes resonate and reproduce, there is a growing urgency to engage in a critique of software that goes beyond taking a distance, and that deals with the fact that we are inevitably already entangled. How can we interact, intervene, respond and think with software? What approaches can allow us to recognize the agency of different actors, their ways of functioning and their politics? What methods of observation enable critical inquiry and affirmative discord? What techniques can we apply to resurface software where it has melted into the infrastructure and into the everyday? How can we remember that software is always at work, especially where it is designed to disappear into the background?\n\nWe pick up the word \"observation\", turning it over and around. We bring it right up to our noses and hold it outstretched to get a better look, holding all of the histories of people looking at other people in mind, holding terminals and keyboards in hand. We regard observation as a way to approach software, as one way to organize engagement with its implications. Observation, and the enabling of it through intensive data-centric feedback mechanisms, is part of  the cybernetic principles that underpin present day software production. Our aim was to scrutinize this methodology in its many manifestations, including in \"observatories\" -- high cost infrastructures of observation troubled by colonial, imperial, empirical traditions and their problematic divisions of nature and culture. And through scrutiny, we hope to open up a set of questions about who gets to observe software (and how) and who is being observed by software (and with what impact)? It is a question of power, one that we answer, at least in part, with critical play. But also with slow pedagogy.\n\nor:\n\nTogether we picked up the word \"observation\", turning it over and around. We brought it right up to our noses and held it outstretched to get a better look, holding all of the histories of people looking at other people in mind, holding terminals and keyboards in hand. We regarded observation as a way to approach software, as one way to organize engagement with its implications. Observation, and the enabling of it through intensive data-centric feedback mechanisms, is part of  the cybernetic principles that underpin present day software production.\n\n\nWe are techno-galactic as we meet the contemporary paradigms of computation that proudly announce their capability for \"scaling up to the universe.\" We stand here as modest witnesses to the scales of software communities and related political economies that involve and require observation.\n\nThis guide offers a set of practical and fantastical tools for the tactical (mis)use of software, empowering/enabling users to resist embedded paradigms and assumptions. It is a collection of methods for approaching software, experiencing its myths and realities, its risks and benefits. Drawing on theories of software and computation developed in academia and elsewhere, we grounded our methods in hands-on exercises and experiments that you now can try at home. This Guide to Techno-Galactic Software Observation offers methods developed in and inspired by the context of software production, hacker culture, software studies, computer science research, Free Software communities, privacy activism, and artistic practice. It invites you to experiment with ways to stay with the trouble of software. Come join us at the edge of the universe, on the metro platform, at your kitchen table, as we mark and measure critical distances from and entanglements with the seemingly endless software systems that surround us.\n\nThe techno-galactic software survival guide was collectively produced as an outcome of the Techno-Galactic Software Observatory. \n[This feels like it could be in a different font size or in brackets or is the start of the next page/spread?]\n\n\nRemaining thoughts/notes for inspiration:\nYou may want to just throw all your devices away, but before you do so, wouldn't you want to, for once poke them back?\nYou may think about retreating to a natural reserve, and live a software free life, but even then, do you think you could manage without talking about your past software troubles.\nAnd, how about those drawings at the nearby cave, that look eerily similar to an ancient flowchart, you think you can just ignore its poetry?\n\n% http://observatory.constantvzw.org/images/friday/P1010328.JPG\n% SHOW: tgsoimages.svg tgsoteam N\n% INFO: Techno-Galactic Software Observation team, WTC Brussels, June 2017\n\n## The Techno-Galactic Software Observatory\n\nIn the summer of 2017, around thirty people gathered in Brussels to explore practices of proximate critique with and of software in the context of a worksession entitled \"Techno-Galactic Software Observatory\".[^]{Worksessions are intensive transdisciplinary moments, organised twice a year by Constant. They aim to provide conditions for participants with different experiences and capabilities to temporarily link their practice and to  develop ideas, prototypes and  research projects together. For the worksessions, primarily Free, Libre and Open Source software is used and material that is available under Open Content Licenses.} The worksession called for software-curious people of all kinds to ask questions about software. The intuition behind such a call was that different types of engagement requires a heterogeneous group of participants with different levels of expertise,  skill and background. During three sessions of two days, participants collectively inspected the space-time of computation and probed the universe of hardware-software separations through excursions, exercises and conversations. They tried out various perspectives and methods to look at the larger picture of software as a concept, as a practice, and as a set of techniques.\n\nThe first two days of The Techno-Galactic Software Observatory included visits to the Musée de l'Informatique Pionnière en Belgique [^]{http://www.nam-ip.be} in Namur and the Computermuseum KULeuven[^]{http://www.etwie.be/database/actor/computermuseum-ku-leuven}. In the surroundings of these collections of historical ’numerical artefacts’, we started viewing software in a long-term context. It was an occasion to reflect on the conditions of its appearance, and allowed us to take on current-day questions from a genealogical perspective. What is software? How did it appear as a concept, in what industrial and governmental circumstances? What happens to the material conditions of its production (minerals, factory labor, hardware) when it evaporates into a cloud?\n\nThe second two days we focused on the space-time dimension of IT development. The way computer programs and operating systems are manufactured changed tremendously through time, and so did its production times and places. From military labs via the mega-corporation cubicles to the open-space freelancer utopia, what ruptures and continuities can be traced in the production, deployment, maintenance and destruction of software? From time-sharing to user-space partitions and containerization, what separations were and are at work? Where and when is software made today?\n\n%!SHOW: tgsoimages.svg tgsoview N\n\n% Let's have one page with more images\n% http://gallery.constantvzw.org/index.php/Techno-Galactic-Software-Observatory/IMAG1399\n% SHOW: tgsoimages.svg scppath\n% INFO: Documenting the path of a Software Curious Person going through the Walk-in Clinic\n\n## The Walk-in Clinic\n\nThe last two days at the Techno-galactic software observatory were dedicated to observation and its consequences. The development of software encompasses a series of practices whose evocative names are increasingly familiar: feedback, report, probe, audit, inspect, scan, diagnose, explore, test ... What are the systems of knowledge and power within which these activities take place, and what other types of observation are possible? As a practical set for our investigations, we set up a walk-in clinic on the 25th floor of the World Trade Center, where users and developers could arrive with software-questions of all kinds.\n\n> Do you suffer from the disappearance of your software into the cloud,\n> feel oppressed by unequal user privilege, or experience the torment of\n> software-ransom of any sort?\n> Bring your devices and interfaces to the World Trade Center!\n> With the help of a clear and in-depth session, at the Techno-Galactic\n> Walk-In Clinic we guarantee immediate results.\n> The  Walk-In Clinic provides free hands-on observations to software\n> curious  people of all kinds. A wide range of professional and amateur \n> practitioners will provide you with Software-as-a-Critique-as-a-Service\n> on the spot. Available services range from immediate interface critique, \n> collaborative code inspection, data dowsing, various forms of network\n> analyses, unusability testing, identification of unknown viruses,\n> risk assessment, opening of black-boxes and more.\n> Free software observations provided.\n> Last intake at 16:45.\n> [^]{Invitation to the Walk-In Clinic, June 2017}\n\n% On the following

once-again\n> that the emperor has no clothes, than in finding a way to _diffract_ critical inquiry\n> in order to make difference patterns in a more worldly way.\n> [@haraway:1996:witness]\n% p429, Haraway, modest witness, 1996 from: http://observatory.constantvzw.org/etherdump/friday.md.diff.html\n\n\nA spectre is haunting the galaxy. Neither revolutionary [reference to communist manifesto] nor a global scale vulnerability [reference to the spectre vulnerability], no matter where you happen to be, there is the spectre of a software running somewhere in the background. Look! There it is, looking right back at you. Be it your phone screen or a passing satellite, software's observation and entangelements in the everyday feel complete. \n\nBut, is that so? The techno-galactic software survival guide that you are reading right now turns this image of a totally observed world driven by an obsessive fantasy of optimization on its head, and sticks it into a self-reflecting elevator. It is the ultimate book of dos and dont's, of mindful agile presence, of forgotten histories and un-inevitable futures, of improv service architectures and all that you can and cannot imagine you need to inhabit a techno-galaxy. Reading is not enough, software is not text, observation is a poten beginning, engagement is tickling.\n\nWith the rediscovery of online services in the 90s, the use of software has increasingly been knitted into the production of software, even while the rhetoric, rights and procedures continue to suggest that use and production constitute separate realms. This knitting together and its corresponding disavowal has an effect on the way software is used and produced that radically alters its operative role in society. The shifts ripple across galaxies, through social structures, working conditions and personal relations, resulting in a profusion of apparatuses aspiring to be seamless while optimizing and monetizing individual and collective flows of information in line with the interests of a handful of actors. The diffusion of software services affects the personal, in the form of intensified identity shaping and self-management. It also affects the public, as more and more libraries, universities and public infrastructures as well as the management of public life rely on \"solutions\" provided by private companies. Centralizing data flows in the clouds, services blur the last traces of the thin line that separates bio- from necro-politics.\n\nGiven how fast these changes resonate and reproduce, there is a growing urgency to engage in a critique of software that goes beyond taking a distance, and that deals with the fact that we are inevitably already entangled. How can we interact, intervene, respond and think with software? What approaches can allow us to recognize the agency of different actors, their ways of functioning and their politics? What methods of observation enable critical inquiry and affirmative discord? What techniques can we apply to resurface software where it has melted into the infrastructure and into the everyday? How can we remember that software is always at work, especially where it is designed to disappear into the background?\n\nWe pick up the word \"observation\", turning it over and around. We bring it right up to our noses and hold it outstretched to get a better look, holding all of the histories of people looking at other people in mind, holding terminals and keyboards in hand. We regard observation as a way to approach software, as one way to organize engagement with its implications. Observation, and the enabling of it through intensive data-centric feedback mechanisms, is part of  the cybernetic principles that underpin present day software production. Our aim was to scrutinize this methodology in its many manifestations, including in \"observatories\" -- high cost infrastructures of observation troubled by colonial, imperial, empirical traditions and their problematic divisions of nature and culture. And through scrutiny, we hope to open up a set of questions about who gets to observe software (and how) and who is being observed by software (and with what impact)? It is a question of power, one that we answer, at least in part, with critical play. But also with slow pedagogy.\n\nor:\n\nTogether we picked up the word \"observation\", turning it over and around. We brought it right up to our noses and held it outstretched to get a better look, holding all of the histories of people looking at other people in mind, holding terminals and keyboards in hand. We regarded observation as a way to approach software, as one way to organize engagement with its implications. Observation, and the enabling of it through intensive data-centric feedback mechanisms, is part of  the cybernetic principles that underpin present day software production.\n\n\nWe are techno-galactic as we meet the contemporary paradigms of computation that proudly announce their capability for \"scaling up to the universe.\" We stand here as modest witnesses to the scales of software communities and related political economies that involve and require observation.\n\nThis guide offers a set of practical and fantastical tools for the tactical (mis)use of software, empowering/enabling users to resist embedded paradigms and assumptions. It is a collection of methods for approaching software, experiencing its myths and realities, its risks and benefits. Drawing on theories of software and computation developed in academia and elsewhere, we grounded our methods in hands-on exercises and experiments that you now can try at home. This Guide to Techno-Galactic Software Observation offers methods developed in and inspired by the context of software production, hacker culture, software studies, computer science research, Free Software communities, privacy activism, and artistic practice. It invites you to experiment with ways to stay with the trouble of software. Come join us at the edge of the universe, on the metro platform, at your kitchen table, as we mark and measure critical distances from and entanglements with the seemingly endless software systems that surround us.\n\nThe techno-galactic software survival guide was collectively produced as an outcome of the Techno-Galactic Software Observatory. \n[This feels like it could be in a different font size or in brackets or is the start of the next page/spread?]\n\n\nRemaining thoughts/notes for inspiration:\nYou may want to just throw all your devices away, but before you do so, wouldn't you want to, for once poke them back?\nYou may think about retreating to a natural reserve, and live a software free life, but even then, do you think you could manage without talking about your past software troubles.\nAnd, how about those drawings at the nearby cave, that look eerily similar to an ancient flowchart, you think you can just ignore its poetry?\n\n% http://observatory.constantvzw.org/images/friday/P1010328.JPG\n% SHOW: tgsoimages.svg tgsoteam N\n% INFO: Techno-Galactic Software Observation team, WTC Brussels, June 2017\n\n## The Techno-Galactic Software Observatory\n\nIn the summer of 2017, around thirty people gathered in Brussels to explore practices of proximate critique with and of software in the context of a worksession entitled \"Techno-Galactic Software Observatory\".[^]{Worksessions are intensive transdisciplinary moments, organised twice a year by Constant. They aim to provide conditions for participants with different experiences and capabilities to temporarily link their practice and to  develop ideas, prototypes and  research projects together. For the worksessions, primarily Free, Libre and Open Source software is used and material that is available under Open Content Licenses.} The worksession called for software-curious people of all kinds to ask questions about software. The intuition behind such a call was that different types of engagement requires a heterogeneous group of participants with different levels of expertise,  skill and background. During three sessions of two days, participants collectively inspected the space-time of computation and probed the universe of hardware-software separations through excursions, exercises and conversations. They tried out various perspectives and methods to look at the larger picture of software as a concept, as a practice, and as a set of techniques.\n\nThe first two days of The Techno-Galactic Software Observatory included visits to the Musée de l'Informatique Pionnière en Belgique [^]{http://www.nam-ip.be} in Namur and the Computermuseum KULeuven[^]{http://www.etwie.be/database/actor/computermuseum-ku-leuven}. In the surroundings of these collections of historical ’numerical artefacts’, we started viewing software in a long-term context. It was an occasion to reflect on the conditions of its appearance, and allowed us to take on current-day questions from a genealogical perspective. What is software? How did it appear as a concept, in what industrial and governmental circumstances? What happens to the material conditions of its production (minerals, factory labor, hardware) when it evaporates into a cloud?\n\nThe second two days we focused on the space-time dimension of IT development. The way computer programs and operating systems are manufactured changed tremendously through time, and so did its production times and places. From military labs via the mega-corporation cubicles to the open-space freelancer utopia, what ruptures and continuities can be traced in the production, deployment, maintenance and destruction of software? From time-sharing to user-space partitions and containerization, what separations were and are at work? Where and when is software made today?\n\n%!SHOW: tgsoimages.svg tgsoview N\n\n% Let's have one page with more images\n% http://gallery.constantvzw.org/index.php/Techno-Galactic-Software-Observatory/IMAG1399\n% SHOW: tgsoimages.svg scppath\n% INFO: Documenting the path of a Software Curious Person going through the Walk-in Clinic\n\n## The Walk-in Clinic\n\nThe last two days at the Techno-galactic software observatory were dedicated to observation and its consequences. The development of software encompasses a series of practices whose evocative names are increasingly familiar: feedback, report, probe, audit, inspect, scan, diagnose, explore, test ... What are the systems of knowledge and power within which these activities take place, and what other types of observation are possible? As a practical set for our investigations, we set up a walk-in clinic on the 25th floor of the World Trade Center, where users and developers could arrive with software-questions of all kinds.\n\n> Do you suffer from the disappearance of your software into the cloud,\n> feel oppressed by unequal user privilege, or experience the torment of\n> software-ransom of any sort?\n> Bring your devices and interfaces to the World Trade Center!\n> With the help of a clear and in-depth session, at the Techno-Galactic\n> Walk-In Clinic we guarantee immediate results.\n> The  Walk-In Clinic provides free hands-on observations to software\n> curious  people of all kinds.

observation\n==========================================\n\n> I am less interested in the critical practice of reflection, of showing once-again\n> that the emperor has no clothes, than in finding a way to _diffract_ critical inquiry\n> in order to make difference patterns in a more worldly way.\n> [@haraway:1996:witness]\n% p429, Haraway, modest witness, 1996 from: http://observatory.constantvzw.org/etherdump/friday.md.diff.html\n\n\nA spectre is haunting the galaxy. Neither revolutionary [reference to communist manifesto] nor a global scale vulnerability [reference to the spectre vulnerability], no matter where you happen to be, there is the spectre of a software running somewhere in the background. Look! There it is, looking right back at you. Be it your phone screen or a passing satellite, software's observation and entangelements in the everyday feel complete. \n\nBut, is that so? The techno-galactic software survival guide that you are reading right now turns this image of a totally observed world driven by an obsessive fantasy of optimization on its head, and sticks it into a self-reflecting elevator. It is the ultimate book of dos and dont's, of mindful agile presence, of forgotten histories and un-inevitable futures, of improv service architectures and all that you can and cannot imagine you need to inhabit a techno-galaxy. Reading is not enough, software is not text, observation is a potential beginning, engagement is tickling.\n\nWith the rediscovery of online services in the 90s [reference to Haigh, Thomas. \"Software in the 1960s as Concept, Service, and Product.\" IEEE Annals of the History of Computing 24.1 (2002): 5-13.], the use of software has increasingly been knitted into the production of software, even while the rhetoric, rights and procedures continue to suggest that use and production constitute separate realms. This knitting together and its corresponding disavowal has an effect on the way software is used and produced that radically alters its operative role in society. The shifts ripple across galaxies, through social structures, working conditions and personal relations, resulting in a profusion of apparatuses aspiring to be seamless while optimizing and monetizing individual and collective flows of information in line with the interests of a handful of actors. The diffusion of software services affects the personal, in the form of intensified identity shaping and self-management. It also affects the public, as more and more libraries, universities and public infrastructures as well as the management of public life rely on \"solutions\" provided by private companies. Centralizing data flows in the clouds, services blur the last traces of the thin line that separates bio- from necro-politics.\n\nGiven how fast these changes resonate and reproduce, there is a growing urgency to engage in a critique of software that goes beyond taking a distance, and that deals with the fact that we are inevitably already entangled. How can we interact, intervene, respond and think with software? What approaches can allow us to recognize the agency of different actors, their ways of functioning and their politics? What methods of observation enable critical inquiry and affirmative discord? What techniques can we apply to resurface software where it has melted into the infrastructure and into the everyday? How can we remember that software is always at work, especially where it is designed to disappear into the background? \n\nIs hashing out the spec of a Software as a Critique as a Service a good starting point, maybe?\n\nWe pick up the word \"observation\", turning it over and around. We bring it right up to our noses and hold it outstretched to get a better look, holding all of the histories of people looking at other people in mind, holding terminals and keyboards in hand. We sync our breath to the We regard observation as a way to approach software, as one way to organize engagement with its implications. Observation, and the enabling of it through intensive data-centric feedback mechanisms, is part of  the cybernetic spell that underpins present day software production. Our aim was?? to scrutinize this methodology in its many manifestations, including in \"observatories\" -- high cost infrastructures of observation troubled by colonial, imperial, empirical traditions and their problematic divisions of nature and culture. And through scrutiny, we hope to open up a set of questions about who gets to observe software (and how) and who is being observed by software (and with what impact)? It is a question of power, one that we answer, at least in part, with critical play. But also with slow pedagogy.\n\nor:\n\nTogether we picked up the word \"observation\", turning it over and around. We brought it right up to our noses and held it outstretched to get a better look, holding all of the histories of people looking at other people in mind, holding terminals and keyboards in hand. We regarded observation as a way to approach software, as one way to organize engagement with its implications. Observation, and the enabling of it through intensive data-centric feedback mechanisms, is part of  the cybernetic principles that underpin present day software production.\n\n\nWe are techno-galactic as we meet the contemporary paradigms of computation that proudly announce their capability for \"scaling up to the universe.\" We stand here as modest witnesses to the scales of software communities and related political economies that involve and require observation.\n\nThis guide offers a set of practical and fantastical tools for the tactical (mis)use of software, empowering/enabling users to resist embedded paradigms and assumptions. It is a collection of methods for approaching software, experiencing its myths and realities, its risks and benefits. Drawing on theories of software and computation developed in academia and elsewhere, we grounded our methods in hands-on exercises and experiments that you now can try at home. This Guide to Techno-Galactic Software Observation offers methods developed in and inspired by the context of software production, hacker culture, software studies, computer science research, Free Software communities, privacy activism, and artistic practice. It invites you to experiment with ways to stay with the trouble of software. Come join us at the edge of the universe, on the metro platform, at your kitchen table, as we mark and measure critical distances from and entanglements with the seemingly endless software systems that surround us.\n\nThe techno-galactic software survival guide was collectively produced as an outcome of the Techno-Galactic Software Observatory. \n[This feels like it could be in a different font size or in brackets or is the start of the next page/spread?]\n\n\nRemaining thoughts/notes for inspiration:\nYou may want to just throw all your devices away, but before you do so, wouldn't you want to, for once poke them back?\nYou may think about retreating to a natural reserve, and live a software free life, but even then, do you think you could manage without talking about your past software troubles.\nAnd, how about those drawings at the nearby cave, that look eerily similar to an ancient flowchart, you think you can just ignore its poetry?\n\n% http://observatory.constantvzw.org/images/friday/P1010328.JPG\n% SHOW: tgsoimages.svg tgsoteam N\n% INFO: Techno-Galactic Software Observation team, WTC Brussels, June 2017\n\n## The Techno-Galactic Software Observatory\n\nIn the summer of 2017, around thirty people gathered in Brussels to explore practices of proximate critique with and of software in the context of a worksession entitled \"Techno-Galactic Software Observatory\".[^]{Worksessions are intensive transdisciplinary moments, organised twice a year by Constant. They aim to provide conditions for participants with different experiences and capabilities to temporarily link their practice and to  develop ideas, prototypes and  research projects together. For the worksessions, primarily Free, Libre and Open Source software is used and material that is available under Open Content Licenses.} The worksession called for software-curious people of all kinds to ask questions about software. The intuition behind such a call was that different types of engagement requires a heterogeneous group of participants with different levels of expertise,  skill and background. During three sessions of two days, participants collectively inspected the space-time of computation and probed the universe of hardware-software separations through excursions, exercises and conversations. They tried out various perspectives and methods to look at the larger picture of software as a concept, as a practice, and as a set of techniques.\n\nThe first two days of The Techno-Galactic Software Observatory included visits to the Musée de l'Informatique Pionnière en Belgique [^]{http://www.nam-ip.be} in Namur and the Computermuseum KULeuven[^]{http://www.etwie.be/database/actor/computermuseum-ku-leuven}. In the surroundings of these collections of historical ’numerical artefacts’, we started viewing software in a long-term context. It was an occasion to reflect on the conditions of its appearance, and allowed us to take on current-day questions from a genealogical perspective. What is software? How did it appear as a concept, in what industrial and governmental circumstances? What happens to the material conditions of its production (minerals, factory labor, hardware) when it evaporates into a cloud?\n\nThe second two days we focused on the space-time dimension of IT development. The way computer programs and operating systems are manufactured changed tremendously through time, and so did its production times and places. From military labs via the mega-corporation cubicles to the open-space freelancer utopia, what ruptures and continuities can be traced in the production, deployment, maintenance and destruction of software? From time-sharing to user-space partitions and containerization, what separations were and are at work? Where and when is software made today?\n\n%!SHOW: tgsoimages.svg tgsoview N\n\n% Let's have one page with more images\n% http://gallery.constantvzw.org/index.php/Techno-Galactic-Software-Observatory/IMAG1399\n% SHOW: tgsoimages.svg scppath\n% INFO: Documenting the path of a Software Curious Person going through the Walk-in Clinic\n\n## The Walk-in Clinic\n\nThe last two days at the Techno-galactic software observatory were dedicated to observation and its consequences. The development of software encompasses a series of practices whose evocative names are increasingly familiar: feedback, report, probe, audit, inspect, scan, diagnose, explore, test ... What are the systems of knowledge and power within which these activities take place, and what other types of observation are possible? As a practical set for our investigations, we set up a walk-in clinic on the 25th floor of the World Trade Center, where users and developers could arrive with software-questions of all kinds.\n\n> Do you suffer from the disappearance of your software into the cloud,\n> feel oppressed by unequal user privilege, or experience the torment of\n> software-ransom of any sort?\n> Bring your devices and interfaces to the World Trade Center!\n> With the help of a clear and in-depth session, at the Techno-Galactic\n> Walk-In Clinic we guarantee immediate results.\n> The  Walk-In Clinic provides free hands-on observations to software\n> curious  people of all kinds.

TOCTITLE: Introduction\n\nA guide to techno-galactic software observation\n==========================================\n\n> I am less interested in the critical practice of reflection, of showing once-again\n> that the emperor has no clothes, than in finding a way to _diffract_ critical inquiry\n> in order to make difference patterns in a more worldly way.\n> [@haraway:1996:witness]\n% p429, Haraway, modest witness, 1996 from: http://observatory.constantvzw.org/etherdump/friday.md.diff.html\n\n\nA spectre is haunting the galaxy. Neither revolutionary [reference to communist manifesto] nor a global scale vulnerability [reference to the spectre vulnerability], no matter where you happen to be, there is the spectre of a software running somewhere in the background. Look! There it is, looking right back at you. Be it your phone screen or a passing satellite, software's observation and entangelements in the everyday feel complete. \n\nBut, is that so? The techno-galactic software survival guide that you are reading right now turns this image of a totally observed world driven by an obsessive fantasy of optimization on its head, and sticks it into a self-reflecting elevator. It is the ultimate book of dos and dont's, of mindful agile presence, of forgotten histories and un-inevitable futures, of improv service architectures and all that you can and cannot imagine you need to inhabit a techno-galaxy. Reading is not enough, software is not text, observation is a potential beginning, engagement is tickling.\n\nWith the rediscovery of online services in the 90s [reference to Haigh, Thomas. \"Software in the 1960s as Concept, Service, and Product.\" IEEE Annals of the History of Computing 24.1 (2002): 5-13.], the use of software has increasingly been knitted into the production of software, even while the rhetoric, rights and procedures continue to suggest that use and production constitute separate realms. This knitting together and its corresponding disavowal has an effect on the way software is used and produced that radically alters its operative role in society. The shifts ripple across galaxies, through social structures, working conditions and personal relations, resulting in a profusion of apparatuses aspiring to be seamless while optimizing and monetizing individual and collective flows of information in line with the interests of a handful of actors. The diffusion of software services affects the personal, in the form of intensified identity shaping and self-management. It also affects the public, as more and more libraries, universities and public infrastructures as well as the management of public life rely on \"solutions\" provided by private companies. Centralizing data flows in the clouds, services blur the last traces of the thin line that separates bio- from necro-politics.\n\nGiven how fast these changes resonate and reproduce, there is a growing urgency to engage in a critique of software that goes beyond taking a distance, and that deals with the fact that we are inevitably already entangled. How can we interact, intervene, respond and think with software? What approaches can allow us to recognize the agency of different actors, their ways of functioning and their politics? What methods of observation enable critical inquiry and affirmative discord? What techniques can we apply to resurface software where it has melted into the infrastructure and into the everyday? How can we remember that software is always at work, especially where it is designed to disappear into the background? \n\nIs hashing out the spec of a Software as a Critique as a Service a good starting point, maybe?\n\nWe pick up the word \"observation\", turning it over and around. We bring it right up to our noses and hold it outstretched to get a better look, holding all of the histories of people looking at other people in mind, holding terminals and keyboards in hand. We sync our breath to the rhythm of our software. We regard this wholistic observation as a way to approach software, as one way to organize engagement with its implications. Observation, and the enabling of it through intensive data-centric feedback mechanisms, is part of  the cybernetic spell that underpins present day software production. Our aim was?? to scrutinize this methodology in its many manifestations, including in \"observatories\" -- high cost infrastructures of observation troubled by colonial, imperial, empirical traditions and their problematic divisions of nature and culture. And through scrutiny, we hope to open up a set of questions about who gets to observe software (and how) and who is being observed by software (and with what impact)? It is a question of power, one that we answer, at least in part, with critical play. But also with slow pedagogy.\n\nor:\n\nTogether we picked up the word \"observation\", turning it over and around. We brought it right up to our noses and held it outstretched to get a better look, holding all of the histories of people looking at other people in mind, holding terminals and keyboards in hand. We regarded observation as a way to approach software, as one way to organize engagement with its implications. Observation, and the enabling of it through intensive data-centric feedback mechanisms, is part of  the cybernetic principles that underpin present day software production.\n\n\nWe are techno-galactic as we meet the contemporary paradigms of computation that proudly announce their capability for \"scaling up to the universe.\" We stand here as modest witnesses to the scales of software communities and related political economies that involve and require observation.\n\nThis guide offers a set of practical and fantastical tools for the tactical (mis)use of software, empowering/enabling users to resist embedded paradigms and assumptions. It is a collection of methods for approaching software, experiencing its myths and realities, its risks and benefits. Drawing on theories of software and computation developed in academia and elsewhere, we grounded our methods in hands-on exercises and experiments that you now can try at home. This Guide to Techno-Galactic Software Observation offers methods developed in and inspired by the context of software production, hacker culture, software studies, computer science research, Free Software communities, privacy activism, and artistic practice. It invites you to experiment with ways to stay with the trouble of software. Come join us at the edge of the universe, on the metro platform, at your kitchen table, as we mark and measure critical distances from and entanglements with the seemingly endless software systems that surround us.\n\nThe techno-galactic software survival guide was collectively produced as an outcome of the Techno-Galactic Software Observatory. \n[This feels like it could be in a different font size or in brackets or is the start of the next page/spread?]\n\n\nRemaining thoughts/notes for inspiration:\nYou may want to just throw all your devices away, but before you do so, wouldn't you want to, for once poke them back?\nYou may think about retreating to a wooden cabin, and live a software-free life, but even then, do you think you could manage without talking about your past software troubles.\nAnd, how about those drawings at the nearby cave, that look eerily similar to an ancient flowchart, you think you can just ignore its poetry?\n\nkostas axelos, planetary interlude, maybe some bits fit with the intro?:\n\n We open ourselves to abysses and we are swallowed up in sys-\n tems and totalizations - for these are fragments and segments of\n \"totality\" which establish themselves as total and/or partial totali-\n tarisms - without foreseeing what might be the home, the house, the\n habitat of living, thinking man, an unfinished, unfinishable being in a\n history which is equally so, neither a shell stuck fast to a rock, nor a\n simple nomad or vagabond. Mortals wish for the familiar and for\n adventure, the known and the unknown, undecided as to who decides\n and to what he decides, chosen rather than choosing. Since they are\n unable to be their own master, they allow themselves to be fixed,\n tossed about, carried away, scattered and put to flight, incapable of\n choosing - if choice there be - between success in and in relation to\n the world, and the World. All this does not constitute an error; wan-\n dering (errance) commands it. \n Galactic irony is watching us. \n Dream of a shadow and dispenser of light, conquistador and\n deserter of the World, pawn and pioneer, man sets out to conquer\n the stars and he ploughs the sea. The assault he launches against the\n astral earth and against the celestial stars is not without disaster.\n Whether he delves into analysis and disintegration - since he needs\n analyses, concrete and tangible solutions and experimentations - or\n whether he plunges into syntheses - since the abstracting power and\n the ungraspable attract him equally -, as precisely and as far as he\n may cast his nets, what his nets catch and what passes through them\n communicate. Never quite awake and never quite beclouded, will we\n learn to live and to see beings and things simultaneously from close\n up and far away, large and small, in their and in our wandering\n (errance), in the great World which is at the same time small, where\n there are no victors - would there be vanquished?\n\n## The Techno-Galactic Software Observatory\n\nIn the summer of 2017, around thirty people gathered in Brussels to explore practices of proximate critique with and of software in the context of a worksession entitled \"Techno-Galactic Software Observatory\".[^]{Worksessions are intensive transdisciplinary moments, organised twice a year by Constant. They aim to provide conditions for participants with different experiences and capabilities to temporarily link their practice and to  develop ideas, prototypes and  research projects together. For the worksessions, primarily Free, Libre and Open Source software is used and material that is available under Open Content Licenses.} The worksession called for software-curious people of all kinds to ask questions about software. The intuition behind such a call was that different types of engagement requires a heterogeneous group of participants with different levels of expertise,  skill and background. During three sessions of two days, participants collectively inspected the space-time of computation and probed the universe of hardware-software separations through excursions, exercises and conversations. They tried out various perspectives and methods to look at the larger picture of software as a concept, as a practice, and as a set of techniques.\n\nThe first two days of The Techno-Galactic Software Observatory included visits to the Musée de l'Informatique Pionnière en Belgique [^]{http://www.nam-ip.be} in Namur and the Computermuseum KULeuven[^]{http://www.etwie.be/database/actor/computermuseum-ku-leuven}. In the surroundings of these collections of historical ’numerical artefacts’, we started viewing software in a long-term context. It was an occasion to reflect on the conditions of its appearance, and allowed us to take on current-day questions from a genealogical perspective. What is software? How did it appear as a concept, in what industrial and governmental circumstances? What happens to the material conditions of its production (minerals, factory labor, hardware) when it evaporates into a cloud?\n\nThe second two days we focused on the space-time dimension of IT development. The way computer programs and operating systems are manufactured changed tremendously through time, and so did its production times and places. From military labs via the mega-corporation cubicles to the open-space freelancer utopia, what ruptures and continuities can be traced in the production, deployment, maintenance and destruction of software? From time-sharing to user-space partitions and containerization, what separations were and are at work? Where and when is software made today?\n\n## The Walk-in Clinic\n\nThe last two days at the Techno-galactic software observatory were dedicated to observation and its consequences. The development of software encompasses a series of practices whose evocative names are increasingly familiar: feedback, report, probe, audit, inspect, scan, diagnose, explore, test ... What are the systems of knowledge and power within which these activities take place, and what other types of observation are possible? As a practical set for our investigations, we set up a walk-in clinic on the 25th floor of the World Trade Center, where users and developers could arrive with software-questions of all kinds.\n\n> Do you suffer from the disappearance of your software into the cloud,\n> feel oppressed by unequal user privilege, or experience the torment of\n> software-ransom of any sort?\n> Bring your devices and interfaces to the World Trade Center!\n> With the help of a clear and in-depth session, at the Techno-Galactic\n> Walk-In Clinic we guarantee immediate results.\n> The  Walk-In Clinic provides free hands-on observations to software\n> curious  people of all kinds. A wide range of professional and amateur \n> practitioners will provide you with Software-as-a-Critique-as-a-Service\n> on the spot. Available services range from immediate interface critique, \n> collaborative code inspection, data dowsing, various forms of network\n> analyses, unusability testing, identification of unknown

Neither revolutionary [reference to communist manifesto] nor a global scale vulnerability [no.], No matter where you happen to be, there is the spectrum of a software running somewhere in the background. Look! There it is, looking right back at you. Be it your phone screen or a satellite passing, software's observation and entang ? The techno-galactic software survival guide is an obsessive fantasy of optimization on its head, and sticks it to a self-reflecting elevator . It is the ultimate book of dos and of which, of mindful agile presence, of forgotten histories and a-inevitable future, of techno-galaxy and all that you can imagine. Reading is not enough, is a text, observation is a potential beginning, commit ediscovery of online services in the 90s [ @haigh: 2001: soft60]The use of software in the production of software, even while the rhetoric, rights and procedures continues to be used. This knitting together and its corresponding disavowal has an effect on the way software is used and The shifts ripple across galaxies, through social structures, working conditions and personal relationships, resulting in a profusion of apparatuses. The diffusion of software services affects the personal, in the form of intensified identity shaping and self-management. It also affects the public, universities and public infrastructures on the subject of \"solutions\" provided by private companies. Centralizing data flows in the clouds, servicesresonate and reproduce, there is a growing urgency to engage in a review of software that goes beyond taking a distance, and that deals with the fact that we are inevitably already entangled. How can we interact, respond, respond and think with software? What approaches can we recognize the agency of different actors, their ways of working and their politics? What methods of observation make critical inquiry and affirmative discord? What techniques can we apply to resurface software where does it come from in the infrastructure and into the everyday? How can we remember that software is always at work, especially where is itthere a problem urning it over and around . We are looking forward to a better look , holding all of the stories of people looking for people in mind, holding terminals and keyboards in hand. We sync our breath to the rhythm of our software. We look at this wholistic observation as a way to approach software, as one way to organize engagement with its implications. Observation, and the Enabling of it intensively through data-centric Feedback Mechanisms, is share of the cybernetic s pell That underpin s present day software production. Our aim was ??to scrutinize this methodology in its many manifestations, including in \"observatories\" - high cost infrastructures of observation troubled by colonial, imperial, empirical traditions and their problematic divisions of nature and culture. And through scrutiny, what do you think about who gets to watchgoldare here to help you get a better look, holding all of the stories of people looking for people in mind, holding terminals and keyboards in hand.

1996 from: http://observatory.constantvzw.org/etherdump/friday.md.diff.html\n\n\nA spectrum [not spectre? spectrum almost but doesn't quite make sense] is haunting the galaxy. Neither revolutionary [reference to communist manifesto] nor a global scale vulnerability [no.], No matter where you happen to be, there is the spectrum of a software running somewhere in the background. Look! There it is, looking right back at you. Be it your phone screen or a satellite passing, software's observation and entanglements in the everyday feel complete. \n\nBut, is it so? The techno-galactic software survival guide is an obsessive fantasy of optimization turned on its head, and stuck to the ceiling of a self-reflecting elevator. It is the ultimate book of dos, of mindful agile presence, of forgotten histories and a-inevitable future, of techno-galaxy and all that you can imagine. Reading is not enough, is a text, observation is a potential beginning, commitment is tickling.\n\nWith the r ediscovery of online services in the 90s [ @haigh: 2001: soft60]The use of software in the production of software, even while the rhetoric, rights and procedures continues to be used. This knitting together and its corresponding disavowal has an effect on the way software is used and The shifts ripple across galaxies, through social structures, working conditions and personal relationships, resulting in a profusion of apparatuses. The diffusion of software services affects the personal, in the form of intensified identity shaping and self-management. It also affects the public, universities and public infrastructures on the subject of \"solutions\" provided by private companies. Centralizing data flows in the clouds, services the last traces of the thin line that separates bio- from necro-politics.\n\nGiven how fast these resonate and reproduce, there is a growing urgency to engage in a review of software that goes beyond taking a distance, and that deals with the fact that we are inevitably already entangled. How can we interact, respond, respond and think with software? What approaches can we recognize the agency of different actors, their ways of working and their politics? What methods of observation make critical inquiry and affirmative discord? What techniques can we apply to resurface software where does it come from in the infrastructure and into the everyday? How can we remember that software is always at work, especially where is it designed to disappear into the background? \n\nIs there a problem?\n\nWe pick up the word \"observation\", t urning it over and around . We are looking forward to a better look , holding all of the stories of people looking at people in mind, holding terminals and keyboards in hand. We sync our breath to the rhythm of our software. We look at this wholistic observation as a way to approach software, as one way to organize engagement with its implications. Observation, and the Enabling of it intensively through data-centric Feedback Mechanisms, is share of the cybernetic s pell That underpin s present day software production. Our aim was ??to scrutinize this methodology in its many manifestations, including in \"observatories\" - high cost infrastructures of observation troubled by colonial, imperial, empirical traditions and their problematic divisions of nature and culture. And through scrutiny, what do you think about who gets to watch software (and how) and who is being observed by software (and with what impact)? It is a question of power, one that we answer, at least in part, with critical play. But also with slow pedagogy.\n\ngold:\n\nTogether we picked up the word \"observation\", turning it over and around. We are here to help you get a better look, holding all of the stories of people looking for people in mind, holding terminals and keyboards in hand. We see how to approach the software, how to organize and engage with its implications. Observation, and the enabling of it through intensive data-centric feedback mechanisms, is part of the cybernetic principles that underpin present day software production.\n\n\nWe are techno-galactic as we meet the contemporary paradigms of computation that proudly announce their capability for \"scaling up to the universe.\" We stand here as modest witnesses to the scales of software communities and related political economies that involve and require observation.\n\nThis guide offers a set of practical and fantastical tools for the tactical (mis)use of software, empowering/enabling users to resist embedded paradigms and assumptions. It is a collection of methods for approaching software, experiencing its myths and realities, its risks and benefits. Drawing on theories of software and computation developed in academia and elsewhere, we grounded our methods in hands-on exercises and experiments that you now can try at home. This Guide to Techno-Galactic Software Observation offers methods developed in and inspired by the context of software production, hacker culture, software studies, computer science research, Free Software communities, privacy activism, and artistic practice. It invites you to experiment with ways to stay with the trouble of software. Come join us at the edge of the universe, on the metro platform, at your kitchen table, as we mark and measure critical distances from and entanglements with the seemingly endless software systems that surround us.\n\nThe techno-galactic software survival guide was collectively produced as an outcome of the Techno-Galactic Software Observatory. \n[This feels like it could be in a different font size or in brackets or is the start of the next page/spread?]\n\n\nRemaining thoughts/notes for inspiration:\nYou may want to just throw all your devices away, but before you do so, wouldn't you want to, for once poke them back?\nYou may think about retreating to a wooden cabin, and live a software-free life, but even then, do you think you could manage without talking about your past software troubles.\nAnd, how about those drawings at the nearby cave, that look eerily similar to an ancient flowchart, you think you can just ignore its poetry?\n\nkostas axelos, planetary interlude, maybe some bits fit with the intro?:\n\n We open ourselves to abysses and we are swallowed up in sys-\n tems and totalizations - for these are fragments and segments of\n \"totality\" which establish themselves as total and/or partial totali-\n tarisms - without foreseeing what might be the home, the house, the\n habitat of living, thinking man, an unfinished, unfinishable being in a\n history which is equally so, neither a shell stuck fast to a rock, nor a\n simple nomad or vagabond. Mortals wish for the familiar and for\n adventure, the known and the unknown, undecided as to who decides\n and to what he decides, chosen rather than choosing. Since they are\n unable to be their own master, they allow themselves to be fixed,\n tossed about, carried away, scattered and put to flight, incapable of\n choosing - if choice there be - between success in and in relation to\n the world, and the World. All this does not constitute an error; wan-\n dering (errance) commands it. \n Galactic irony is watching us. \n Dream of a shadow and dispenser of light, conquistador and\n deserter of the World, pawn and pioneer, man sets out to conquer\n the stars and he ploughs the sea. The assault he launches against the\n astral earth and against the celestial stars is not without disaster.\n Whether he delves into analysis and disintegration - since he needs\n analyses, concrete and tangible solutions and experimentations - or\n whether he plunges into syntheses - since the abstracting power and\n the ungraspable attract him equally -, as precisely and as far as he\n may cast his nets, what his nets catch and what passes through them\n communicate. Never quite awake and never quite beclouded, will we\n learn to live and to see beings and things simultaneously from close\n up and far away, large and small, in their and in our wandering\n (errance), in the great World which is at the same time small, where\n there are no victors - would there be vanquished?\n\n## The Techno-Galactic Software Observatory\n\nIn the summer of 2017, around thirty people gathered in Brussels to explore practices of proximate critique with and of software in the context of a worksession entitled \"Techno-Galactic Software Observatory\".[^]{Worksessions are intensive transdisciplinary moments, organised twice a year by Constant. They aim to provide conditions for participants with different experiences and capabilities to temporarily link their practice and to  develop ideas, prototypes and  research projects together. For the worksessions, primarily Free, Libre and Open Source software is used and material that is available under Open Content Licenses.} The worksession called for software-curious people of all kinds to ask questions about software. The intuition behind such a call was that different types of engagement requires a heterogeneous group of participants with different levels of expertise,  skill and background. During three sessions of two days, participants collectively inspected the space-time of computation and probed the universe of hardware-software separations through excursions, exercises and conversations. They tried out various perspectives and methods to look at the larger picture of software as a concept, as a practice, and as a set of techniques.\n\nThe first two days of The Techno-Galactic Software Observatory included visits to the Musée de l'Informatique Pionnière en Belgique [^]{http://www.nam-ip.be} in Namur and the Computermuseum KULeuven[^]{http://www.etwie.be/database/actor/computermuseum-ku-leuven}. In the surroundings of these collections of historical ’numerical artefacts’, we started viewing software in a long-term context. It was an occasion to reflect on the conditions of its appearance, and allowed us to take on current-day questions from a genealogical perspective. What is software? How did it appear as a concept, in what industrial and governmental circumstances? What happens to the material conditions of its production (minerals, factory labor, hardware) when it evaporates into a cloud?\n\nThe second two days we focused on the space-time dimension of IT development. The way computer programs and operating systems are manufactured changed tremendously through time, and so did its production times and places. From military labs via the mega-corporation cubicles to the open-space freelancer utopia, what ruptures and continuities can be traced in the production, deployment, maintenance and destruction of software? From time-sharing to user-space partitions and containerization, what separations were and are at work? Where and when is software made today?\n\n## The Walk-in Clinic\n\nThe last two days at the Techno-galactic software observatory were dedicated to observation and its consequences. The development of software encompasses a series of practices whose evocative names are increasingly familiar: feedback, report, probe, audit, inspect, scan, diagnose, explore, test ... What are the systems of knowledge and power within which these activities take place, and what other types of observation are possible? As a practical set for our investigations, we set up a walk-in clinic on the 25th floor of the World Trade Center, where users and developers could arrive with software-questions of all kinds.\n\n> Do you suffer from the disappearance of your software into the cloud,\n> feel oppressed by unequal user privilege, or experience the torment of\n> software-ransom of any sort?\n> Bring your devices and interfaces to the World Trade Center!\n> With the help of a clear and in-depth session, at the Techno-Galactic\n> Walk-In Clinic we guarantee immediate results.\n> The  Walk-In Clinic provides free hands-on observations to software\n> curious  people of all kinds.

Haraway, modest witness, 1996 from: http://observatory.constantvzw.org/etherdump/friday.md.diff.html\n\n\nA not spectre is haunting the galaxy. Neither revolutionary [reference to communist manifesto] nor a global scale vulnerability catastrophe [reference to recently found vulnerability like climate change? or like spectre? ], No matter where you happen to be, there is the spectrum of a software running somewhere in the background. Look! There it is, looking right back at you. Be it your phone screen or a satellite passing, software's observation and entanglements in the everyday feel complete. \n\nBut, is it so? The techno-galactic software survival guide is an obsessive fantasy of optimization turned on its head, and stuck to the ceiling of a self-reflecting elevator. It is the ultimate book of dos, of mindful agile presence, of forgotten histories and a-inevitable future, of techno-galaxy and all that you can imagine. Reading is not enough, is a text, observation is a potential beginning, commitment is tickling.\n\nWith the rediscovery of online services in the 90s [ @haigh: 2001: soft60]The use of software in the production of software, even while the rhetoric, rights and procedures continues to be used. This knitting together and its corresponding disavowal has an effect on the way software is used and The shifts ripple across galaxies, through social structures, working conditions and personal relationships, resulting in a profusion of apparatuses. The diffusion of software services affects the personal, in the form of intensified identity shaping and self-management. It also affects the public, universities and public infrastructures on the subject of \"solutions\" provided by private companies. Centralizing data flows in the clouds, services the last traces of the thin line that separates bio- from necro-politics.\n\nGiven how fast these resonate and reproduce, there is a growing urgency to engage in a review of software that goes beyond taking a distance, and that deals with the fact that we are inevitably already entangled. How can we interact, respond, respond and think with software? What approaches can we recognize the agency of different actors, their ways of working and their politics? What methods of observation make critical inquiry and affirmative discord? What techniques can we apply to resurface software where does it come from in the infrastructure and into the everyday? How can we remember that software is always at work, especially where is it designed to disappear into the background? \n\nIs there a problem?\n\nWe pick up the word \"observation\", t urning it over and around . We are looking forward to a better look , holding all of the stories of people looking at people in mind, holding terminals and keyboards in hand. We sync our breath to the rhythm of our software. We look at this wholistic observation as a way to approach software, as one way to organize engagement with its implications. Observation, and the Enabling of it intensively through data-centric Feedback Mechanisms, is share of the cybernetic s pell That underpin s present day software production. Our aim was ??to scrutinize this methodology in its many manifestations, including in \"observatories\" - high cost infrastructures of observation troubled by colonial, imperial, empirical traditions and their problematic divisions of nature and culture. And through scrutiny, what do you think about who gets to watch software (and how) and who is being observed by software (and with what impact)? It is a question of power, one that we answer, at least in part, with critical play. But also with slow pedagogy.\n\ngold:\n\nTogether we picked up the word \"observation\", turning it over and around. We are here to help you get a better look, holding all of the stories of people looking for people in mind, holding terminals and keyboards in hand. We see how to approach the software, how to organize and engage with its implications. Observation, and the enabling of it through intensive data-centric feedback mechanisms, is part of the cybernetic principles that underpin present day software production.\n\n\nWe are techno-galactic as we meet the contemporary paradigms of computation that proudly announce their capability for \"scaling up to the universe.\" We stand here as modest witnesses to the scales of software communities and related political economies that involve and require observation.\n\nThis guide offers a set of practical and fantastical tools for the tactical (mis)use of software, empowering/enabling users to resist embedded paradigms and assumptions. It is a collection of methods for approaching software, experiencing its myths and realities, its risks and benefits. Drawing on theories of software and computation developed in academia and elsewhere, we grounded our methods in hands-on exercises and experiments that you now can try at home. This Guide to Techno-Galactic Software Observation offers methods developed in and inspired by the context of software production, hacker culture, software studies, computer science research, Free Software communities, privacy activism, and artistic practice. It invites you to experiment with ways to stay with the trouble of software. Come join us at the edge of the universe, on the metro platform, at your kitchen table, as we mark and measure critical distances from and entanglements with the seemingly endless software systems that surround us.\n\nThe techno-galactic software survival guide was collectively produced as an outcome of the Techno-Galactic Software Observatory. \n[This feels like it could be in a different font size or in brackets or is the start of the next page/spread?]\n\n\nRemaining thoughts/notes for inspiration:\nYou may want to just throw all your devices away, but before you do so, wouldn't you want to, for once poke them back?\nYou may think about retreating to a wooden cabin, and live a software-free life, but even then, do you think you could manage without talking about your past software troubles.\nAnd, how about those drawings at the nearby cave, that look eerily similar to an ancient flowchart, you think you can just ignore its poetry?\n\nkostas axelos, planetary interlude, maybe some bits fit with the intro?:\n\n We open ourselves to abysses and we are swallowed up in sys-\n tems and totalizations - for these are fragments and segments of\n \"totality\" which establish themselves as total and/or partial totali-\n tarisms - without foreseeing what might be the home, the house, the\n habitat of living, thinking man, an unfinished, unfinishable being in a\n history which is equally so, neither a shell stuck fast to a rock, nor a\n simple nomad or vagabond. Mortals wish for the familiar and for\n adventure, the known and the unknown, undecided as to who decides\n and to what he decides, chosen rather than choosing. Since they are\n unable to be their own master, they allow themselves to be fixed,\n tossed about, carried away, scattered and put to flight, incapable of\n choosing - if choice there be - between success in and in relation to\n the world, and the World. All this does not constitute an error; wan-\n dering (errance) commands it. \n Galactic irony is watching us. \n Dream of a shadow and dispenser of light, conquistador and\n deserter of the World, pawn and pioneer, man sets out to conquer\n the stars and he ploughs the sea. The assault he launches against the\n astral earth and against the celestial stars is not without disaster.\n Whether he delves into analysis and disintegration - since he needs\n analyses, concrete and tangible solutions and experimentations - or\n whether he plunges into syntheses - since the abstracting power and\n the ungraspable attract him equally -, as precisely and as far as he\n may cast his nets, what his nets catch and what passes through them\n communicate. Never quite awake and never quite beclouded, will we\n learn to live and to see beings and things simultaneously from close\n up and far away, large and small, in their and in our wandering\n (errance), in the great World which is at the same time small, where\n there are no victors - would there be vanquished?\n\n## The Techno-Galactic Software Observatory\n\nIn the summer of 2017, around thirty people gathered in Brussels to explore practices of proximate critique with and of software in the context of a worksession entitled \"Techno-Galactic Software Observatory\".[^]{Worksessions are intensive transdisciplinary moments, organised twice a year by Constant. They aim to provide conditions for participants with different experiences and capabilities to temporarily link their practice and to  develop ideas, prototypes and  research projects together. For the worksessions, primarily Free, Libre and Open Source software is used and material that is available under Open Content Licenses.} The worksession called for software-curious people of all kinds to ask questions about software. The intuition behind such a call was that different types of engagement requires a heterogeneous group of participants with different levels of expertise,  skill and background. During three sessions of two days, participants collectively inspected the space-time of computation and probed the universe of hardware-software separations through excursions, exercises and conversations. They tried out various perspectives and methods to look at the larger picture of software as a concept, as a practice, and as a set of techniques.\n\nThe first two days of The Techno-Galactic Software Observatory included visits to the Musée de l'Informatique Pionnière en Belgique [^]{http://www.nam-ip.be} in Namur and the Computermuseum KULeuven[^]{http://www.etwie.be/database/actor/computermuseum-ku-leuven}. In the surroundings of these collections of historical ’numerical artefacts’, we started viewing software in a long-term context. It was an occasion to reflect on the conditions of its appearance, and allowed us to take on current-day questions from a genealogical perspective. What is software? How did it appear as a concept, in what industrial and governmental circumstances? What happens to the material conditions of its production (minerals, factory labor, hardware) when it evaporates into a cloud?\n\nThe second two days we focused on the space-time dimension of IT development. The way computer programs and operating systems are manufactured changed tremendously through time, and so did its production times and places. From military labs via the mega-corporation cubicles to the open-space freelancer utopia, what ruptures and continuities can be traced in the production, deployment, maintenance and destruction of software? From time-sharing to user-space partitions and containerization, what separations were and are at work? Where and when is software made today?\n\n## The Walk-in Clinic\n\nThe last two days at the Techno-galactic software observatory were dedicated to observation and its consequences. The development of software encompasses a series of practices whose evocative names are increasingly familiar: feedback, report, probe, audit, inspect, scan, diagnose, explore, test ... What are the systems of knowledge and power within which these activities take place, and what other types of observation are possible? As a practical set for our investigations, we set up a walk-in clinic on the 25th floor of the World Trade Center, where users and developers could arrive with software-questions of all kinds.\n\n> Do you suffer from the disappearance of your software into the cloud,\n> feel oppressed by unequal user privilege, or experience the torment of\n> software-ransom of any sort?\n> Bring your devices and interfaces to the World Trade Center!\n> With the help of a clear and in-depth session, at the Techno-Galactic\n> Walk-In Clinic we guarantee immediate results.\n> The  Walk-In Clinic provides free hands-on observations to software\n> curious  people of all kinds. A wide range of professional and amateur \n> practitioners will provide you with Software-as-a-Critique-as-a-Service\n> on the spot. Available services range from immediate interface critique, \n> collaborative code inspection, data dowsing, various forms of network\n> analyses, unusability testing, identification of unknown viruses,\n> risk assessment, opening of black-boxes and more.\n> Free software observations provided.\n> Last intake at 16:45.\n> [^]{Invitation to the Walk-In Clinic, June 2017}\n\n% On the following

Observation\n==========================================\n\n> I am less interested in the critical practice of reflection, of showing once-again that the emperor has no clothes, than in finding a way to diffract critical inquiry in order to make difference patterns in a more worldly way.\n> [@haraway:1996:witness]\n% p429, Haraway, modest witness, 1996 from: http://observatory.constantvzw.org/etherdump/friday.md.diff.html\n\n \nA spectre is haunting the galaxy. It is neither revolutionary [marx:1848:cmanifesto] nor is it a global scale vulnerability [meltdown:2018:spectre17], but no matter where you happen to be, there is the spectre of a software running somewhere in the background. Look! There it is, looking right back at you. Be it your phone screen or a passing satellite, software's observation and entanglement in the everyday feels complete. \n\nBut is it really? The Techno-Galactic Software survival guide is an obsessive fantasy of optimization turned on its head, and stuck to the ceiling of a self-reflecting elevator. It is the ultimate book of dos, of mindful agile presence, of forgotten histories and a-inevitable future, of techno-galaxy and all that you can imagine. Reading is not enough, is a text, observation is a potential beginning, commitment is tickling.\n\nWith the rediscovery of online services in the 90s [@haigh:2001:soft60]The use of software in the production of software, even while the rhetoric, rights and procedures continues to be used. This knitting together and its corresponding disavowal has an effect on the way software is used and The shifts ripple across galaxies, through social structures, working conditions and personal relationships, resulting in a profusion of apparatuses. The diffusion of software services affects the personal, in the form of intensified identity shaping and self-management. It also affects the public, universities and public infrastructures on the subject of \"solutions\" provided by private companies. Centralizing data flows in the clouds, services the last traces of the thin line that separates bio- from necro-politics.\n\nGiven how fast these resonate and reproduce, there is a growing urgency to engage in a review of software that goes beyond taking a distance, and that deals with the fact that we are inevitably already entangled. How can we interact, respond, respond and think with software? What approaches can we recognize the agency of different actors, their ways of working and their politics? What methods of observation make critical inquiry and affirmative discord? What techniques can we apply to resurface software where does it come from in the infrastructure and into the everyday? How can we remember that software is always at work, especially where is it designed to disappear into the background? \n\nIs there a problem?\n\nWe pick up the word \"observation\", t urning it over and around . We are looking forward to a better look , holding all of the stories of people looking at people in mind, holding terminals and keyboards in hand. We sync our breath to the rhythm of our software. We look at this wholistic observation as a way to approach software, as one way to organize engagement with its implications. Observation, and the Enabling of it intensively through data-centric Feedback Mechanisms, is share of the cybernetic s pell That underpin s present day software production. Our aim was ??to scrutinize this methodology in its many manifestations, including in \"observatories\" - high cost infrastructures of observation troubled by colonial, imperial, empirical traditions and their problematic divisions of nature and culture. And through scrutiny, what do you think about who gets to watch software (and how) and who is being observed by software (and with what impact)? It is a question of power, one that we answer, at least in part, with critical play. But also with slow pedagogy.\n\ngold:\n\nTogether we picked up the word \"observation\", turning it over and around. We are here to help you get a better look, holding all of the stories of people looking for people in mind, holding terminals and keyboards in hand. We see how to approach the software, how to organize and engage with its implications. Observation, and the enabling of it through intensive data-centric feedback mechanisms, is part of the cybernetic principles that underpin present day software production.\n\n\nWe are techno-galactic as we meet the contemporary paradigms of computation that proudly announce their capability for \"scaling up to the universe.\" We stand here as modest witnesses to the scales of software communities and related political economies that involve and require observation.\n\nThis guide offers a set of practical and fantastical tools for the tactical (mis)use of software, empowering/enabling users to resist embedded paradigms and assumptions. It is a collection of methods for approaching software, experiencing its myths and realities, its risks and benefits. Drawing on theories of software and computation developed in academia and elsewhere, we grounded our methods in hands-on exercises and experiments that you now can try at home. This Guide to Techno-Galactic Software Observation offers methods developed in and inspired by the context of software production, hacker culture, software studies, computer science research, Free Software communities, privacy activism, and artistic practice. It invites you to experiment with ways to stay with the trouble of software. Come join us at the edge of the universe, on the metro platform, at your kitchen table, as we mark and measure critical distances from and entanglements with the seemingly endless software systems that surround us.\n\nThe techno-galactic software survival guide was collectively produced as an outcome of the Techno-Galactic Software Observatory. \n[This feels like it could be in a different font size or in brackets or is the start of the next page/spread?]\n\n\nRemaining thoughts/notes for inspiration:\nYou may want to just throw all your devices away, but before you do so, wouldn't you want to, for once poke them back?\nYou may think about retreating to a wooden cabin, and live a software-free life, but even then, do you think you could manage without talking about your past software troubles.\nAnd, how about those drawings at the nearby cave, that look eerily similar to an ancient flowchart, you think you can just ignore its poetry?\n\nkostas axelos, planetary interlude, maybe some bits fit with the intro?:\n\n We open ourselves to abysses and we are swallowed up in sys-\n tems and totalizations - for these are fragments and segments of\n \"totality\" which establish themselves as total and/or partial totali-\n tarisms - without foreseeing what might be the home, the house, the\n habitat of living, thinking man, an unfinished, unfinishable being in a\n history which is equally so, neither a shell stuck fast to a rock, nor a\n simple nomad or vagabond. Mortals wish for the familiar and for\n adventure, the known and the unknown, undecided as to who decides\n and to what he decides, chosen rather than choosing. Since they are\n unable to be their own master, they allow themselves to be fixed,\n tossed about, carried away, scattered and put to flight, incapable of\n choosing - if choice there be - between success in and in relation to\n the world, and the World. All this does not constitute an error; wan-\n dering (errance) commands it. \n Galactic irony is watching us. \n Dream of a shadow and dispenser of light, conquistador and\n deserter of the World, pawn and pioneer, man sets out to conquer\n the stars and he ploughs the sea. The assault he launches against the\n astral earth and against the celestial stars is not without disaster.\n Whether he delves into analysis and disintegration - since he needs\n analyses, concrete and tangible solutions and experimentations - or\n whether he plunges into syntheses - since the abstracting power and\n the ungraspable attract him equally -, as precisely and as far as he\n may cast his nets, what his nets catch and what passes through them\n communicate. Never quite awake and never quite beclouded, will we\n learn to live and to see beings and things simultaneously from close\n up and far away, large and small, in their and in our wandering\n (errance), in the great World which is at the same time small, where\n there are no victors - would there be vanquished?\n\n## The Techno-Galactic Software Observatory\n\nIn the summer of 2017, around thirty people gathered in Brussels to explore practices of proximate critique with and of software in the context of a worksession entitled \"Techno-Galactic Software Observatory\".[^]{Worksessions are intensive transdisciplinary moments, organised twice a year by Constant. They aim to provide conditions for participants with different experiences and capabilities to temporarily link their practice and to  develop ideas, prototypes and  research projects together. For the worksessions, primarily Free, Libre and Open Source software is used and material that is available under Open Content Licenses.} The worksession called for software-curious people of all kinds to ask questions about software. The intuition behind such a call was that different types of engagement requires a heterogeneous group of participants with different levels of expertise,  skill and background. During three sessions of two days, participants collectively inspected the space-time of computation and probed the universe of hardware-software separations through excursions, exercises and conversations. They tried out various perspectives and methods to look at the larger picture of software as a concept, as a practice, and as a set of techniques.\n\nThe first two days of The Techno-Galactic Software Observatory included visits to the Musée de l'Informatique Pionnière en Belgique [^]{http://www.nam-ip.be} in Namur and the Computermuseum KULeuven[^]{http://www.etwie.be/database/actor/computermuseum-ku-leuven}. In the surroundings of these collections of historical ’numerical artefacts’, we started viewing software in a long-term context. It was an occasion to reflect on the conditions of its appearance, and allowed us to take on current-day questions from a genealogical perspective. What is software? How did it appear as a concept, in what industrial and governmental circumstances? What happens to the material conditions of its production (minerals, factory labor, hardware) when it evaporates into a cloud?\n\nThe second two days we focused on the space-time dimension of IT development. The way computer programs and operating systems are manufactured changed tremendously through time, and so did its production times and places. From military labs via the mega-corporation cubicles to the open-space freelancer utopia, what ruptures and continuities can be traced in the production, deployment, maintenance and destruction of software? From time-sharing to user-space partitions and containerization, what separations were and are at work? Where and when is software made today?\n\n## The Walk-in Clinic\n\nThe last two days at the Techno-galactic software observatory were dedicated to observation and its consequences. The development of software encompasses a series of practices whose evocative names are increasingly familiar: feedback, report, probe, audit, inspect, scan, diagnose, explore, test ... What are the systems of knowledge and power within which these activities take place, and what other types of observation are possible? As a practical set for our investigations, we set up a walk-in clinic on the 25th floor of the World Trade Center, where users and developers could arrive with software-questions of all kinds.\n\n> Do you suffer from the disappearance of your software into the cloud,\n> feel oppressed by unequal user privilege, or experience the torment of\n> software-ransom of any sort?\n> Bring your devices and interfaces to the World Trade Center!\n> With the help of a clear and in-depth session, at the Techno-Galactic\n> Walk-In Clinic we guarantee immediate results.\n> The  Walk-In Clinic provides free hands-on observations to software\n> curious  people of all kinds. A wide range of professional and amateur \n> practitioners will provide you with Software-as-a-Critique-as-a-Service\n> on the spot. Available services range from immediate interface critique, \n> collaborative code inspection, data dowsing, various forms of network\n> analyses, unusability testing, identification of unknown viruses,\n> risk assessment, opening of black-boxes and more.\n> Free software observations provided.\n> Last intake at 16:45.\n> [^]{Invitation to the Walk-In Clinic, June 2017}\n\n% On the following

TOCTITLE: Introduction\n\nA Guide to Techno-Galactic Software Observation\n==========================================\n\n> I am less interested in the critical practice of reflection, of showing once-again that the emperor has no clothes, than in finding a way to diffract critical inquiry in order to make difference patterns in a more worldly way.\n> [@haraway:1996:witness]\n% p429, Haraway, modest witness, 1996 from: http://observatory.constantvzw.org/etherdump/friday.md.diff.html\n\n \nA spectre is haunting the galaxy. It is neither revolutionary [marx:1848:cmanifesto] nor is it a global scale vulnerability [meltdown:2018:spectre17], but no matter where you happen to be, there is the spectre of a software running somewhere in the background. Look! There it is, looking right back at you. Be it your phone screen or a passing satellite, software's observation and entanglement in the everyday feels complete. \n\nBut is it really? The Techno-Galactic Software Survival Guide is an obsessive fantasy of optimization turned on its head, and stuck to the ceiling of a self-reflecting elevator. It is the ultimate book of dos and don'ts, of forgotten histories and un-inevitable futures, of mindful agile presences and improvisational service architectures, all that you can and cannot imagine you need in a techno. Reading is not enough, software is not just a text, observation is a potential beginning, engagement is tickling.\n\n\n\n\nWith the rediscovery of online services in the 90s [@haigh:2001:soft60]The use of software in the production of software, even while the rhetoric, rights and procedures continues to be used. This knitting together and its corresponding disavowal has an effect on the way software is used and The shifts ripple across galaxies, through social structures, working conditions and personal relationships, resulting in a profusion of apparatuses. The diffusion of software services affects the personal, in the form of intensified identity shaping and self-management. It also affects the public, universities and public infrastructures on the subject of \"solutions\" provided by private companies. Centralizing data flows in the clouds, services the last traces of the thin line that separates bio- from necro-politics.\n\nGiven how fast these resonate and reproduce, there is a growing urgency to engage in a review of software that goes beyond taking a distance, and that deals with the fact that we are inevitably already entangled. How can we interact, respond, respond and think with software? What approaches can we recognize the agency of different actors, their ways of working and their politics? What methods of observation make critical inquiry and affirmative discord? What techniques can we apply to resurface software where does it come from in the infrastructure and into the everyday? How can we remember that software is always at work, especially where is it designed to disappear into the background? \n\nIs there a problem?\n\nWe pick up the word \"observation\", t urning it over and around . We are looking forward to a better look , holding all of the stories of people looking at people in mind, holding terminals and keyboards in hand. We sync our breath to the rhythm of our software. We look at this wholistic observation as a way to approach software, as one way to organize engagement with its implications. Observation, and the Enabling of it intensively through data-centric Feedback Mechanisms, is share of the cybernetic s pell That underpin s present day software production. Our aim was ??to scrutinize this methodology in its many manifestations, including in \"observatories\" - high cost infrastructures of observation troubled by colonial, imperial, empirical traditions and their problematic divisions of nature and culture. And through scrutiny, what do you think about who gets to watch software (and how) and who is being observed by software (and with what impact)? It is a question of power, one that we answer, at least in part, with critical play. But also with slow pedagogy.\n\ngold:\n\nTogether we picked up the word \"observation\", turning it over and around. We are here to help you get a better look, holding all of the stories of people looking for people in mind, holding terminals and keyboards in hand. We see how to approach the software, how to organize and engage with its implications. Observation, and the enabling of it through intensive data-centric feedback mechanisms, is part of the cybernetic principles that underpin present day software production.\n\n\nWe are techno-galactic as we meet the contemporary paradigms of computation that proudly announce their capability for \"scaling up to the universe.\" We stand here as modest witnesses to the scales of software communities and related political economies that involve and require observation.\n\nThis guide offers a set of practical and fantastical tools for the tactical (mis)use of software, empowering/enabling users to resist embedded paradigms and assumptions. It is a collection of methods for approaching software, experiencing its myths and realities, its risks and benefits. Drawing on theories of software and computation developed in academia and elsewhere, we grounded our methods in hands-on exercises and experiments that you now can try at home. This Guide to Techno-Galactic Software Observation offers methods developed in and inspired by the context of software production, hacker culture, software studies, computer science research, Free Software communities, privacy activism, and artistic practice. It invites you to experiment with ways to stay with the trouble of software. Come join us at the edge of the universe, on the metro platform, at your kitchen table, as we mark and measure critical distances from and entanglements with the seemingly endless software systems that surround us.\n\nThe techno-galactic software survival guide was collectively produced as an outcome of the Techno-Galactic Software Observatory. \n[This feels like it could be in a different font size or in brackets or is the start of the next page/spread?]\n\n\nRemaining thoughts/notes for inspiration:\nYou may want to just throw all your devices away, but before you do so, wouldn't you want to, for once poke them back?\nYou may think about retreating to a wooden cabin, and live a software-free life, but even then, do you think you could manage without talking about your past software troubles.\nAnd, how about those drawings at the nearby cave, that look eerily similar to an ancient flowchart, you think you can just ignore its poetry?\n\nkostas axelos, planetary interlude, maybe some bits fit with the intro?:\n\n We open ourselves to abysses and we are swallowed up in sys-\n tems and totalizations - for these are fragments and segments of\n \"totality\" which establish themselves as total and/or partial totali-\n tarisms - without foreseeing what might be the home, the house, the\n habitat of living, thinking man, an unfinished, unfinishable being in a\n history which is equally so, neither a shell stuck fast to a rock, nor a\n simple nomad or vagabond. Mortals wish for the familiar and for\n adventure, the known and the unknown, undecided as to who decides\n and to what he decides, chosen rather than choosing. Since they are\n unable to be their own master, they allow themselves to be fixed,\n tossed about, carried away, scattered and put to flight, incapable of\n choosing - if choice there be - between success in and in relation to\n the world, and the World. All this does not constitute an error; wan-\n dering (errance) commands it. \n Galactic irony is watching us. \n Dream of a shadow and dispenser of light, conquistador and\n deserter of the World, pawn and pioneer, man sets out to conquer\n the stars and he ploughs the sea. The assault he launches against the\n astral earth and against the celestial stars is not without disaster.\n Whether he delves into analysis and disintegration - since he needs\n analyses, concrete and tangible solutions and experimentations - or\n whether he plunges into syntheses - since the abstracting power and\n the ungraspable attract him equally -, as precisely and as far as he\n may cast his nets, what his nets catch and what passes through them\n communicate. Never quite awake and never quite beclouded, will we\n learn to live and to see beings and things simultaneously from close\n up and far away, large and small, in their and in our wandering\n (errance), in the great World which is at the same time small, where\n there are no victors - would there be vanquished?\n\n## The Techno-Galactic Software Observatory\n\nIn the summer of 2017, around thirty people gathered in Brussels to explore practices of proximate critique with and of software in the context of a worksession entitled \"Techno-Galactic Software Observatory\".[^]{Worksessions are intensive transdisciplinary moments, organised twice a year by Constant. They aim to provide conditions for participants with different experiences and capabilities to temporarily link their practice and to  develop ideas, prototypes and  research projects together. For the worksessions, primarily Free, Libre and Open Source software is used and material that is available under Open Content Licenses.} The worksession called for software-curious people of all kinds to ask questions about software. The intuition behind such a call was that different types of engagement requires a heterogeneous group of participants with different levels of expertise,  skill and background. During three sessions of two days, participants collectively inspected the space-time of computation and probed the universe of hardware-software separations through excursions, exercises and conversations. They tried out various perspectives and methods to look at the larger picture of software as a concept, as a practice, and as a set of techniques.\n\nThe first two days of The Techno-Galactic Software Observatory included visits to the Musée de l'Informatique Pionnière en Belgique [^]{http://www.nam-ip.be} in Namur and the Computermuseum KULeuven[^]{http://www.etwie.be/database/actor/computermuseum-ku-leuven}. In the surroundings of these collections of historical ’numerical artefacts’, we started viewing software in a long-term context. It was an occasion to reflect on the conditions of its appearance, and allowed us to take on current-day questions from a genealogical perspective. What is software? How did it appear as a concept, in what industrial and governmental circumstances? What happens to the material conditions of its production (minerals, factory labor, hardware) when it evaporates into a cloud?\n\nThe second two days we focused on the space-time dimension of IT development. The way computer programs and operating systems are manufactured changed tremendously through time, and so did its production times and places. From military labs via the mega-corporation cubicles to the open-space freelancer utopia, what ruptures and continuities can be traced in the production, deployment, maintenance and destruction of software? From time-sharing to user-space partitions and containerization, what separations were and are at work? Where and when is software made today?\n\n## The Walk-in Clinic\n\nThe last two days at the Techno-galactic software observatory were dedicated to observation and its consequences. The development of software encompasses a series of practices whose evocative names are increasingly familiar: feedback, report, probe, audit, inspect, scan, diagnose, explore, test ... What are the systems of knowledge and power within which these activities take place, and what other types of observation are possible? As a practical set for our investigations, we set up a walk-in clinic on the 25th floor of the World Trade Center, where users and developers could arrive with software-questions of all kinds.\n\n> Do you suffer from the disappearance of your software into the cloud,\n> feel oppressed by unequal user privilege, or experience the torment of\n> software-ransom of any sort?\n> Bring your devices and interfaces to the World Trade Center!\n> With the help of a clear and in-depth session, at the Techno-Galactic\n> Walk-In Clinic we guarantee immediate results.\n> The  Walk-In Clinic provides free hands-on observations to software\n> curious  people of all kinds.

The shifts ripple across galaxies, through social structures, working conditions and personal relations, resulting in a profusion of apparatuses aspiring to be seamless while optimizing and monetizing individual and collective flows of information in line with the interests of a handful of actors. The diffusion of software services affects the personal, in the form of intensified identity shaping and self-management. It also affects the public, as more and more libraries, universities and public infrastructures as well as the management of public life rely on \"solutions\" provided by private companies. Centralizing data flows in the clouds, services blur the last traces of the thin line that separates bio- from necro-politics.","meta":{"author":"a.UNWRO0eoIgQHRlJ9","timestamp":1518198926575}},"pad:observatory.guide.introduction:revs:1927":{"changeset":"Z:b68>12|h=1qq=a-n*e+1p$ediscovery of online services in

TOCTITLE: Introduction\n\nA guide to techno-galactic software observation\n==========================================\n\n> I am less interested in the critical practice of reflection, of showing once-again\n> that the emperor has no clothes, than in finding a way to _diffract_ critical inquiry\n> in order to make difference patterns in a more worldly way.\n> [@haraway:1996:witness]\n% p429, Haraway, modest witness, 1996 from: http://observatory.constantvzw.org/etherdump/friday.md.diff.html\n\nThe techno-galactic software survival guide that you are holding right now was collectively produced as an outcome of the Techno-Galactic Software Observatory. This guide proposes several ways to achieve critical distance from the seemingly endless software systems that surround us. It offers practical and fantastical tools for the tactical (mis)use of software, empowering/enabling users to resist embedded paradigms and assumptions. It is a collection of methods for approaching software, experiencing its myths and realities, its risks and benefits.\n\nWith the rise of online services, the use of software has increasingly been knitted into the production of software, even while the rhetoric, rights, and procedures continue to suggest that these roles constitute separate realms. This has an effect on the way software is used and produced, and radically alters its operative role in society. The shifts ripple across galaxies, through social structures, working conditions and personal relations, resulting in a profusion of apparatuses aspiring to be seamless while optimizing and monetizing individual and collective flows of information in line with the interests of a handful of actors. The diffusion of software services affects the personal, in the form of intensified identity shaping and self-management. It also affects the public, as more and more libraries, universities and public infrastructures as well as the management of public life rely on \"solutions\" provided by private companies. Centralizing data flows in the clouds, services blur the last traces of the thin line that separates bio- from necro-politics.\n\nGiven how fast these changes resonate and reproduce, there is a growing urgency to engage in a critique of software that goes beyond taking a distance, and that deals with the fact that we are inevitably already entangled. How can we interact, intervene, respond and think with software? What approaches can allow us to recognize the agency of different actors, their ways of functioning and their politics? What methods of observation enable critical inquiry and affirmative discord? What techniques can we apply to resurface software where it has melted into the infrastructure and into the everyday? How can we remember that software is always at work, especially where it is designed to disappear into the background?\n\nWe took on the term of observation for a number of reasons. We regard observation as a way to approach software, as one way to organize engagement with its implications. Observation, and the enabling of observation through intensive data-centric feedback mechanisms, is part of  the cybernetic principles that underpin present day software production. Our aim was to scrutinize this methodology in its many manifestations, including in \"observatories\" -- high cost infrastructures [testing infrastructures?] of observation troubled by colonial, imperial traditions and their problematic divisions of nature and culture -- with the hope of opening up questions about who gets to observe software (and how) and who is being observed by software (and with what impact)? It is a question of power, one that we answer, at least in part, with critical play.\n\nWe adopted the term techno-galactic to match the advertised capability of \"scaling up to the universe\" that comes in contemporary paradigms of computation, and to address different scales of software communities and related political economies that involve and require observation.\n\nDrawing on theories of software and computation developed in academia and elsewhere, we grounded our methods in hands-on exercises and experiments that you now can try at home. This Guide to Techno-Galactic Software Observation offers methods developed in and inspired by the context of software production, hacker culture, software studies, computer science research, Free Software communities, privacy activism, and artistic practice. It invites you to experiment with ways to stay with the trouble of software.\n\n% ![Techno-Galactic Software Observation team, WTC Brussels, June 2017]( http://observatory.constantvzw.org/images/friday/P1010328.JPG )\n\n## The Techno-Galactic Software Observatory\nIn the summer of 2017, around thirty people gathered in Brussels to explore practices of proximate critique with and of software in the context of a worksession entitled \"Techno-Galactic Software Observatory\".[^]{Worksessions are intensive transdisciplinary moments, organised twice a year by Constant. They aim to provide conditions for participants with different experiences and capabilities to temporarily link their practice and to  develop ideas, prototypes and  research projects together. For the worksessions, primarily Free, Libre and Open Source software is used and material that is available under ???} The worksession called for software-curious people of all kinds to ask questions about software. The intuition behind such a call was that different types of engagement requires a heterogeneous group of participants with different levels of expertise,  skill and background. During three sessions of two days, participants collectively inspected the space-time of computation and probed the universe of hardware-software separations through excursions, exercises and conversations. They tried out various perspectives and methods to look at the larger picture of software as a concept, as a practice, and as a set of techniques.\n\nThe first two days of The Techno-Galactic Software Observatory included visits to the Musée de l'Informatique Pionnière en Belgique [^]{http://www.nam-ip.be} in Namur and the Computermuseum KULeuven[^]{http://www.etwie.be/database/actor/computermuseum-ku-leuven}. In the surrounding of these collections of historical ’numerical artefacts’, we started viewing software in a long-term context. It offered us the occasion to reflect on the conditions of its appearance, and allowed us to take on current-day questions from a genealogical perspective. What is software? How did it appear as a concept, in what industrial and governmental circumstances? What happens to the material conditions of its production (minerals, factory labor, hardware) when it evaporates into a cloud?\n\nThe second two days we focused on the space-time dimension of IT development. The way computer programs and operating systems are manufactured changed tremendously through time, and so did its production times and places. From military labs via the mega-corporation cubicles to the open-space freelancer utopia, what ruptures and continuities can be traced in the production, deployment, maintenance and destruction of software? From time-sharing to user-space partitions and containerization, what separations were and are at work? Where and when is software made today?\n\n## The Walk-in Clinic\n\nThe last two days at the Techno-galactic software observatory were dedicated to observation and its consequences. The development of software encompasses a series of practices whose evocative names are increasingly familiar: feedback, report, probe, audit, inspect, scan, diagnose, explore, test ... What are the systems of knowledge and power within which these activities take place, and what other types of observation are possible? As a practical set for our investigations, we set up a walk-in clinic on the 25th floor of the World Trade Center, where users and developers could arrive with software-questions of all kinds.\n\n% ![Documenting the path of a Software Curious Person going through the Walk-in Clinic]( http://gallery.constantvzw.org/index.php/Techno-Galactic-Software-Observatory/IMAG1399 )\n\n> Do you suffer from the disappearance of your software into the cloud,\n> feel oppressed by unequal user privilege, or experience the torment of\n> software-ransom of any sort?\n> Bring your devices and interfaces to the World Trade Center!\n> With the help of a clear and in-depth session, at the Techno-Galactic\n> Walk-In Clinic we guarantee immediate results.\n> The  Walk-In Clinic provides free hands-on observations to software\n> curious  people of all kinds.

It is neither revolutionary [marx:1848:cmanifesto] nor is it a global scale vulnerability [meltdown:2018:spectre17], but no matter where you happen to be, there is the spectre of a software running somewhere in the background. Look! There it is, looking right back at you. Be it your phone screen or a passing satellite, software's observation and entanglement in the everyday feels complete. \n\nBut is it really? The Techno-Galactic Software Survival Guide is an obsessive fantasy of optimization turned on its head, and stuck to the ceiling of a self-reflecting elevator. It is the ultimate book of dos and don'ts, of forgotten histories and un-inevitable futures, of mindful agile presences and improvisational service architectures, and all that you can and cannot imagine needing in a techno-galaxy. Reading is not enough, software is not just a text, observation is one potential beginning, engagement is tickling.\n\n\nWith the rediscovery of online services in the 90s [@haigh:2001:soft60], the use of software has increasingly been knitted into the production of software, even while the rhetoric, rights and procedures continue to suggest that use and production constitute separate realms. This knitting together and its corresponding disavowal has an effect on the way software is used and produced that radically alters its operative role in society. The shifts ripple across galaxies, through social structures, working conditions and personal relations, resulting in a profusion of apparatuses aspiring to be seamless while optimizing and monetizing individual and collective flows of information in line with the interests of a handful of actors. The diffusion of software services affects the personal, in the form of intensified identity shaping and self-management. It also affects the public, as more and more libraries, universities and public infrastructures as well as the management of public life rely on \"solutions\" provided by private companies. Centralizing data flows in the clouds, services blur the last traces of the thin line that separates bio- from necro-politics.\n\n\nGiven how fast software resonates and reproduces, there is a growing urgency to engage it in manners that goes beyond taking a distance, and that deal with the fact that we are inevitably already entangled. How can we interact, respond and think with software? What approaches can we use to recognize the agency of different actors, their ways of working and their politics? What methods of observation are conducive to critical inquiry and affirmative discord? What techniques can we apply to resurface software, where does it come from in the infrastructure and into the everyday? How can we remember that software is always at work, especially where is it designed to disappear into the background? \n\nIs there a problem?\n\nWe pick up the word \"observation\", t urning it over and around . We are looking forward to a better look , holding all of the stories of people looking at people in mind, holding terminals and keyboards in hand. We sync our breath to the rhythm of our software. We look at this wholistic observation as a way to approach software, as one way to organize engagement with its implications. Observation, and the Enabling of it intensively through data-centric Feedback Mechanisms, is share of the cybernetic spell That underpin s present day software production. Our aim was ??to scrutinize this methodology in its many manifestations, including in \"observatories\" - high cost infrastructures of observation troubled by colonial, imperial, empirical traditions and their problematic divisions of nature and culture. And through scrutiny, what do you think about who gets to watch software (and how) and who is being observed by software (and with what impact)? It is a question of power, one that we answer, at least in part, with critical play. But also with slow pedagogy.\n\ngold:\n\nTogether we picked up the word \"observation\", turning it over and around. We are here to help you get a better look, holding all of the stories of people looking for people in mind, holding terminals and keyboards in hand. We see how to approach the software, how to organize and engage with its implications. Observation, and the enabling of it through intensive data-centric feedback mechanisms, is part of the cybernetic principles that underpin present day software production.\n\n\nWe are techno-galactic as we meet the contemporary paradigms of computation that proudly announce their capability for \"scaling up to the universe.\" We stand here as modest witnesses to the scales of software communities and related political economies that involve and require observation.\n\nThis guide offers a set of practical and fantastical tools for the tactical (mis)use of software, empowering/enabling users to resist embedded paradigms and assumptions. It is a collection of methods for approaching software, experiencing its myths and realities, its risks and benefits. Drawing on theories of software and computation developed in academia and elsewhere, we grounded our methods in hands-on exercises and experiments that you now can try at home. This Guide to Techno-Galactic Software Observation offers methods developed in and inspired by the context of software production, hacker culture, software studies, computer science research, Free Software communities, privacy activism, and artistic practice. It invites you to experiment with ways to stay with the trouble of software. Come join us at the edge of the universe, on the metro platform, at your kitchen table, as we mark and measure critical distances from and entanglements with the seemingly endless software systems that surround us.\n\nThe techno-galactic software survival guide was collectively produced as an outcome of the Techno-Galactic Software Observatory. \n[This feels like it could be in a different font size or in brackets or is the start of the next page/spread?]\n\n\nRemaining thoughts/notes for inspiration:\nYou may want to just throw all your devices away, but before you do so, wouldn't you want to, for once poke them back?\nYou may think about retreating to a wooden cabin, and live a software-free life, but even then, do you think you could manage without talking about your past software troubles.\nAnd, how about those drawings at the nearby cave, that look eerily similar to an ancient flowchart, you think you can just ignore its poetry?\n\nkostas axelos, planetary interlude, maybe some bits fit with the intro?:\n\n We open ourselves to abysses and we are swallowed up in sys-\n tems and totalizations - for these are fragments and segments of\n \"totality\" which establish themselves as total and/or partial totali-\n tarisms - without foreseeing what might be the home, the house, the\n habitat of living, thinking man, an unfinished, unfinishable being in a\n history which is equally so, neither a shell stuck fast to a rock, nor a\n simple nomad or vagabond. Mortals wish for the familiar and for\n adventure, the known and the unknown, undecided as to who decides\n and to what he decides, chosen rather than choosing. Since they are\n unable to be their own master, they allow themselves to be fixed,\n tossed about, carried away, scattered and put to flight, incapable of\n choosing - if choice there be - between success in and in relation to\n the world, and the World. All this does not constitute an error; wan-\n dering (errance) commands it. \n Galactic irony is watching us. \n Dream of a shadow and dispenser of light, conquistador and\n deserter of the World, pawn and pioneer, man sets out to conquer\n the stars and he ploughs the sea. The assault he launches against the\n astral earth and against the celestial stars is not without disaster.\n Whether he delves into analysis and disintegration - since he needs\n analyses, concrete and tangible solutions and experimentations - or\n whether he plunges into syntheses - since the abstracting power and\n the ungraspable attract him equally -, as precisely and as far as he\n may cast his nets, what his nets catch and what passes through them\n communicate. Never quite awake and never quite beclouded, will we\n learn to live and to see beings and things simultaneously from close\n up and far away, large and small, in their and in our wandering\n (errance), in the great World which is at the same time small, where\n there are no victors - would there be vanquished?\n\n## The Techno-Galactic Software Observatory\n\nIn the summer of 2017, around thirty people gathered in Brussels to explore practices of proximate critique with and of software in the context of a worksession entitled \"Techno-Galactic Software Observatory\".[^]{Worksessions are intensive transdisciplinary moments, organised twice a year by Constant. They aim to provide conditions for participants with different experiences and capabilities to temporarily link their practice and to  develop ideas, prototypes and  research projects together. For the worksessions, primarily Free, Libre and Open Source software is used and material that is available under Open Content Licenses.} The worksession called for software-curious people of all kinds to ask questions about software. The intuition behind such a call was that different types of engagement requires a heterogeneous group of participants with different levels of expertise,  skill and background. During three sessions of two days, participants collectively inspected the space-time of computation and probed the universe of hardware-software separations through excursions, exercises and conversations. They tried out various perspectives and methods to look at the larger picture of software as a concept, as a practice, and as a set of techniques.\n\nThe first two days of The Techno-Galactic Software Observatory included visits to the Musée de l'Informatique Pionnière en Belgique [^]{http://www.nam-ip.be} in Namur and the Computermuseum KULeuven[^]{http://www.etwie.be/database/actor/computermuseum-ku-leuven}. In the surroundings of these collections of historical ’numerical artefacts’, we started viewing software in a long-term context. It was an occasion to reflect on the conditions of its appearance, and allowed us to take on current-day questions from a genealogical perspective. What is software? How did it appear as a concept, in what industrial and governmental circumstances? What happens to the material conditions of its production (minerals, factory labor, hardware) when it evaporates into a cloud?\n\nThe second two days we focused on the space-time dimension of IT development. The way computer programs and operating systems are manufactured changed tremendously through time, and so did its production times and places. From military labs via the mega-corporation cubicles to the open-space freelancer utopia, what ruptures and continuities can be traced in the production, deployment, maintenance and destruction of software? From time-sharing to user-space partitions and containerization, what separations were and are at work? Where and when is software made today?\n\n## The Walk-in Clinic\n\nThe last two days at the Techno-galactic software observatory were dedicated to observation and its consequences. The development of software encompasses a series of practices whose evocative names are increasingly familiar: feedback, report, probe, audit, inspect, scan, diagnose, explore, test ... What are the systems of knowledge and power within which these activities take place, and what other types of observation are possible? As a practical set for our investigations, we set up a walk-in clinic on the 25th floor of the World Trade Center, where users and developers could arrive with software-questions of all kinds.\n\n> Do you suffer from the disappearance of your software into the cloud,\n> feel oppressed by unequal user privilege, or experience the torment of\n> software-ransom of any sort?\n> Bring your devices and interfaces to the World Trade Center!\n> With the help of a clear and in-depth session, at the Techno-Galactic\n> Walk-In Clinic we guarantee immediate results.\n> The  Walk-In Clinic provides free hands-on observations to software\n> curious  people of all kinds.

pick up the word \"observation\", turning it over and around.

We regard observation as a way to approach software, as one way to organize engagement with its implications. Observation, and the enabling of it through intensive data-centric feedback mechanisms, is part of  the cybernetic principles that underpin present day software production. Our aim was to scrutinize this methodology in its many manifestations, including in \"observatories\" -- high cost infrastructures of observation troubled by colonial, imperial, empirical traditions and their problematic divisions of nature and culture. And through scrutiny, we hope to open up a set of questions about who gets to observe software (and how) and who is being observed by software (and with what impact)?

It is neither revolutionary [marx:1848:cmanifesto] nor is it a global scale vulnerability [meltdown:2018:spectre17], but no matter where you happen to be, there is the spectre of a software running somewhere in the background. Look! There it is, looking right back at you. Be it your phone screen or a passing satellite, software's observation and entanglement in the everyday feels complete. \n\nBut is it really? The Techno-Galactic Software Survival Guide is an obsessive fantasy of optimization turned on its head, and stuck to the ceiling of a self-reflecting elevator. It is the ultimate book of dos and don'ts, of forgotten histories and un-inevitable futures, of mindful agile presences and improvisational service architectures, and all that you can and cannot imagine needing in a techno-galaxy. Reading is not enough, software is not just a text, observation is one potential beginning, engagement is tickling.\n\n\nWith the rediscovery of online services in the 90s [@haigh:2001:soft60], the use of software has increasingly been knitted into the production of software, even while the rhetoric, rights and procedures continue to suggest that use and production constitute separate realms. This knitting together and its corresponding disavowal has an effect on the way software is used and produced that radically alters its operative role in society. The shifts ripple across galaxies, through social structures, working conditions and personal relations, resulting in a profusion of apparatuses aspiring to be seamless while optimizing and monetizing individual and collective flows of information in line with the interests of a handful of actors. The diffusion of software services affects the personal, in the form of intensified identity shaping and self-management. It also affects the public, as more and more libraries, universities and public infrastructures as well as the management of public life rely on \"solutions\" provided by private companies. Centralizing data flows in the clouds, services blur the last traces of the thin line that separates bio- from necro-politics.\n\n\nGiven how fast software resonates and reproduces, there is a growing urgency to engage it in manners that goes beyond taking a distance, and that deal with the fact that we are inevitably already entangled. How can we interact, respond and think with software? What approaches can we use to recognize the agency of different actors, their ways of working and their politics? What methods of observation are conducive to critical inquiry and affirmative discord? What techniques can we apply to resurface software, finding the sites where software infrastructure are reconfiguring the everyday? How can we remember that software is always at work, especially where it is designed to disappear into the background? \n\nWe pick up the word \"observation\", turning it over and around. We are looking forward to a better look , holding all of the stories of people looking at people in mind, holding terminals and keyboards in hand. We sync our breath to the rhythm of our software. We look at this wholistic observation as a way to approach software, as one way to organize engagement with its implications. Observation, and the Enabling of it intensively through data-centric Feedback Mechanisms, is share of the cybernetic spell That underpin s present day software production. Our aim was ??to scrutinize this methodology in its many manifestations, including in \"observatories\" - high cost infrastructures of observation troubled by colonial, imperial, empirical traditions and their problematic divisions of nature and culture. And through scrutiny, what do you think about who gets to watch software (and how) and who is being observed by software (and with what impact)? It is a question of power, one that we answer, at least in part, with critical play. But also with slow pedagogy.\n\nWe pick up the word \"observation\", turning it over and around. We bring it right up to our noses and hold it outstretched to get a better look, holding all of the histories of people looking at other people in mind, holding terminals and keyboards in hand. We sync our breath to the rhythm of our software. We propose holistic observation as a way to approach software, as one way to organize engagement with its implications. Observation, and the enabling of it through intensive data-centric feedback mechanisms, is part of the cybernetic spells that underpin present day software production. Our aim was to scrutinize this methodology in its many manifestations, including in \"observatories\" -- high cost infrastructures of observation troubled by colonial, imperial, empirical traditions and their problematic divisions of nature and culture. And through scrutiny, we hope to open up a set of questions about who gets to observe software (and how) and who is being observed by software (and with what impact)? It is a question of power, one that we answer, at least in part, with critical play. But also with slow pedagogy.\n\nWe respond cargo cult programming ritual of shotgun debugging or deep magic\n\n\ngold:\n\nTogether we picked up the word \"observation\", turning it over and around. We are here to help you get a better look, holding all of the stories of people looking for people in mind, holding terminals and keyboards in hand. We see how to approach the software, how to organize and engage with its implications. Observation, and the enabling of it through intensive data-centric feedback mechanisms, is part of the cybernetic principles that underpin present day software production.\n\n\nWe are techno-galactic as we meet the contemporary paradigms of computation that proudly announce their capability for \"scaling up to the universe.\" We stand here as modest witnesses to the scales of software communities and related political economies that involve and require observation.\n\nThis guide offers a set of practical and fantastical tools for the tactical (mis)use of software, empowering/enabling users to resist embedded paradigms and assumptions. It is a collection of methods for approaching software, experiencing its myths and realities, its risks and benefits. Drawing on theories of software and computation developed in academia and elsewhere, we grounded our methods in hands-on exercises and experiments that you now can try at home. This Guide to Techno-Galactic Software Observation offers methods developed in and inspired by the context of software production, hacker culture, software studies, computer science research, Free Software communities, privacy activism, and artistic practice. It invites you to experiment with ways to stay with the trouble of software. Come join us at the edge of the universe, on the metro platform, at your kitchen table, as we mark and measure critical distances from and entanglements with the seemingly endless software systems that surround us.\n\nThe techno-galactic software survival guide was collectively produced as an outcome of the Techno-Galactic Software Observatory. \n[This feels like it could be in a different font size or in brackets or is the start of the next page/spread?]\n\n\nRemaining thoughts/notes for inspiration:\nYou may want to just throw all your devices away, but before you do so, wouldn't you want to, for once poke them back?\nYou may think about retreating to a wooden cabin, and live a software-free life, but even then, do you think you could manage without talking about your past software troubles.\nAnd, how about those drawings at the nearby cave, that look eerily similar to an ancient flowchart, you think you can just ignore its poetry?\n\nkostas axelos, planetary interlude, maybe some bits fit with the intro?:\n\n We open ourselves to abysses and we are swallowed up in sys-\n tems and totalizations - for these are fragments and segments of\n \"totality\" which establish themselves as total and/or partial totali-\n tarisms - without foreseeing what might be the home, the house, the\n habitat of living, thinking man, an unfinished, unfinishable being in a\n history which is equally so, neither a shell stuck fast to a rock, nor a\n simple nomad or vagabond. Mortals wish for the familiar and for\n adventure, the known and the unknown, undecided as to who decides\n and to what he decides, chosen rather than choosing. Since they are\n unable to be their own master, they allow themselves to be fixed,\n tossed about, carried away, scattered and put to flight, incapable of\n choosing - if choice there be - between success in and in relation to\n the world, and the World. All this does not constitute an error; wan-\n dering (errance) commands it. \n Galactic irony is watching us. \n Dream of a shadow and dispenser of light, conquistador and\n deserter of the World, pawn and pioneer, man sets out to conquer\n the stars and he ploughs the sea. The assault he launches against the\n astral earth and against the celestial stars is not without disaster.\n Whether he delves into analysis and disintegration - since he needs\n analyses, concrete and tangible solutions and experimentations - or\n whether he plunges into syntheses - since the abstracting power and\n the ungraspable attract him equally -, as precisely and as far as he\n may cast his nets, what his nets catch and what passes through them\n communicate. Never quite awake and never quite beclouded, will we\n learn to live and to see beings and things simultaneously from close\n up and far away, large and small, in their and in our wandering\n (errance), in the great World which is at the same time small, where\n there are no victors - would there be vanquished?\n\n## The Techno-Galactic Software Observatory\n\nIn the summer of 2017, around thirty people gathered in Brussels to explore practices of proximate critique with and of software in the context of a worksession entitled \"Techno-Galactic Software Observatory\".[^]{Worksessions are intensive transdisciplinary moments, organised twice a year by Constant. They aim to provide conditions for participants with different experiences and capabilities to temporarily link their practice and to  develop ideas, prototypes and  research projects together. For the worksessions, primarily Free, Libre and Open Source software is used and material that is available under Open Content Licenses.} The worksession called for software-curious people of all kinds to ask questions about software. The intuition behind such a call was that different types of engagement requires a heterogeneous group of participants with different levels of expertise,  skill and background. During three sessions of two days, participants collectively inspected the space-time of computation and probed the universe of hardware-software separations through excursions, exercises and conversations. They tried out various perspectives and methods to look at the larger picture of software as a concept, as a practice, and as a set of techniques.\n\nThe first two days of The Techno-Galactic Software Observatory included visits to the Musée de l'Informatique Pionnière en Belgique [^]{http://www.nam-ip.be} in Namur and the Computermuseum KULeuven[^]{http://www.etwie.be/database/actor/computermuseum-ku-leuven}. In the surroundings of these collections of historical ’numerical artefacts’, we started viewing software in a long-term context. It was an occasion to reflect on the conditions of its appearance, and allowed us to take on current-day questions from a genealogical perspective. What is software? How did it appear as a concept, in what industrial and governmental circumstances? What happens to the material conditions of its production (minerals, factory labor, hardware) when it evaporates into a cloud?\n\nThe second two days we focused on the space-time dimension of IT development. The way computer programs and operating systems are manufactured changed tremendously through time, and so did its production times and places. From military labs via the mega-corporation cubicles to the open-space freelancer utopia, what ruptures and continuities can be traced in the production, deployment, maintenance and destruction of software? From time-sharing to user-space partitions and containerization, what separations were and are at work? Where and when is software made today?\n\n## The Walk-in Clinic\n\nThe last two days at the Techno-galactic software observatory were dedicated to observation and its consequences. The development of software encompasses a series of practices whose evocative names are increasingly familiar: feedback, report, probe, audit, inspect, scan, diagnose, explore, test ... What are the systems of knowledge and power within which these activities take place, and what other types of observation are possible? As a practical set for our investigations, we set up a walk-in clinic on the 25th floor of the World Trade Center, where users and developers could arrive with software-questions of all kinds.\n\n> Do you suffer from the disappearance of your software into the cloud,\n> feel oppressed by unequal user privilege, or experience the torment of\n> software-ransom of any sort?\n> Bring your devices and interfaces to the World Trade Center!\n> With the help of a clear and in-depth session, at the Techno-Galactic\n> Walk-In Clinic we guarantee immediate results.\n> The  Walk-In Clinic provides free hands-on observations to software\n> curious  people of all kinds. A wide range of professional and amateur \n> practitioners will provide you with Software-as-a-Critique-as-a-Service\n> on the spot. Available services range from immediate interface critique, \n> collaborative code inspection, data dowsing, various forms of network\n> analyses, unusability testing, identification of unknown viruses,\n> risk assessment, opening of black-boxes and more.\n> Free software observations provided.\n> Last intake at 16:45.\n> [^]{Invitation to the Walk-In Clinic, June 2017}\n\n% On the following

It is neither revolutionary [marx:1848:cmanifesto] nor is it a global scale vulnerability [meltdown:2018:spectre17], but no matter where you happen to be, there is the spectre of a software running somewhere in the background. Look! There it is, looking right back at you. Be it your phone screen or a passing satellite, software's observation and entanglement in the everyday feels complete. \n\nBut is it really? The Techno-Galactic Software Survival Guide is an obsessive fantasy of optimization turned on its head, and stuck to the ceiling of a self-reflecting elevator. It is the ultimate book of dos and don'ts, of forgotten histories and un-inevitable futures, of mindful agile presences and improvisational service architectures, and all that you can and cannot imagine needing in a techno-galaxy. Reading is not enough, software is not just a text, observation is one potential beginning, engagement is tickling.\n\n\nWith the rediscovery of online services in the 90s [@haigh:2001:soft60], the use of software has increasingly been knitted into the production of software, even while the rhetoric, rights and procedures continue to suggest that use and production constitute separate realms. This knitting together and its corresponding disavowal has an effect on the way software is used and produced that radically alters its operative role in society. The shifts ripple across galaxies, through social structures, working conditions and personal relations, resulting in a profusion of apparatuses aspiring to be seamless while optimizing and monetizing individual and collective flows of information in line with the interests of a handful of actors. The diffusion of software services affects the personal, in the form of intensified identity shaping and self-management. It also affects the public, as more and more libraries, universities and public infrastructures as well as the management of public life rely on \"solutions\" provided by private companies. Centralizing data flows in the clouds, services blur the last traces of the thin line that separates bio- from necro-politics.\n\n\nGiven how fast software resonates and reproduces, there is a growing urgency to engage it in manners that goes beyond taking a distance, and that deal with the fact that we are inevitably already entangled. How can we interact, respond and think with software? What approaches can we use to recognize the agency of different actors, their ways of working and their politics? What methods of observation are conducive to critical inquiry and affirmative discord? What techniques can we apply to resurface software, finding the sites where software infrastructure are reconfiguring the everyday? How can we remember that software is always at work, especially where it is designed to disappear into the background? \n\nWe pick up the word \"observation\", turning it over and around. We are looking forward to a better look , holding all of the stories of people looking at people in mind, holding terminals and keyboards in hand. We sync our breath to the rhythm of our software. We look at this wholistic observation as a way to approach software, as one way to organize engagement with its implications. Observation, and the Enabling of it intensively through data-centric Feedback Mechanisms, is share of the cybernetic spell That underpin s present day software production. Our aim was ??to scrutinize this methodology in its many manifestations, including in \"observatories\" - high cost infrastructures of observation troubled by colonial, imperial, empirical traditions and their problematic divisions of nature and culture. And through scrutiny, what do you think about who gets to watch software (and how) and who is being observed by software (and with what impact)? It is a question of power, one that we answer, at least in part, with critical play. But also with slow pedagogy.\n\nWe pick up the word \"observation\", turning it over and around. We bring it right up to our noses and hold it outstretched to get a better look, holding all of the histories of people looking at other people in mind, holding terminals and keyboards in hand. We sync our breath to the rhythm of our software. We propose holistic observation as a way to approach software, as one way to organize engagement with its implications. Observation, and the enabling of it through intensive data-centric feedback mechanisms, is part of the cybernetic spells that underpin present day software production. Our aim was to scrutinize this methodology in its many manifestations, including in \"observatories\" -- high cost infrastructures of observation troubled by colonial, imperial, empirical traditions and their problematic divisions of nature and culture.

It is a question of power, one that we answer, at least in part, with critical play.

Cargo cult programming is typically symptomatic of a programmer not understanding either a bug they were attempting to solve or the apparent solution (compare shotgun debugging, deep magic).[1] The term cargo cult programmer may apply when an unskilled or novice computer programmer (or one inexperienced with the problem at hand) copies some program code from one place to another with little or no understanding of how it works or whether it is required in its new position.\nCargo cult programming can also refer to the results of applying a design pattern or coding style blindly without understanding the reasons behind that design principle.

We are here to help you get a better look, holding all of the stories of people looking for people in mind, holding terminals and keyboards in hand. We see how to approach the software, how to organize and engage with its implications. Observation, and the enabling of it through intensive data-centric feedback mechanisms, is part of the cybernetic principles that underpin present day software production.\n\n\nWe are techno-galactic as we meet the contemporary paradigms of computation that proudly announce their capability for \"scaling up to the universe.\" We stand here as modest witnesses to the scales of software communities and related political economies that involve and require observation.\n\nThis guide offers a set of practical and fantastical tools for the tactical (mis)use of software, empowering/enabling users to resist embedded paradigms and assumptions. It is a collection of methods for approaching software, experiencing its myths and realities, its risks and benefits. Drawing on theories of software and computation developed in academia and elsewhere, we grounded our methods in hands-on exercises and experiments that you now can try at home. This Guide to Techno-Galactic Software Observation offers methods developed in and inspired by the context of software production, hacker culture, software studies, computer science research, Free Software communities, privacy activism, and artistic practice. It invites you to experiment with ways to stay with the trouble of software. Come join us at the edge of the universe, on the metro platform, at your kitchen table, as we mark and measure critical distances from and entanglements with the seemingly endless software systems that surround us.\n\nThe techno-galactic software survival guide was collectively produced as an outcome of the Techno-Galactic Software Observatory. \n[This feels like it could be in a different font size or in brackets or is the start of the next page/spread?]\n\n\nRemaining thoughts/notes for inspiration:\nYou may want to just throw all your devices away, but before you do so, wouldn't you want to, for once poke them back?\nYou may think about retreating to a wooden cabin, and live a software-free life, but even then, do you think you could manage without talking about your past software troubles.\nAnd, how about those drawings at the nearby cave, that look eerily similar to an ancient flowchart, you think you can just ignore its poetry?\n\nkostas axelos, planetary interlude, maybe some bits fit with the intro?:\n\n We open ourselves to abysses and we are swallowed up in sys-\n tems and totalizations - for these are fragments and segments of\n \"totality\" which establish themselves as total and/or partial totali-\n tarisms - without foreseeing what might be the home, the house, the\n habitat of living, thinking man, an unfinished, unfinishable being in a\n history which is equally so, neither a shell stuck fast to a rock, nor a\n simple nomad or vagabond. Mortals wish for the familiar and for\n adventure, the known and the unknown, undecided as to who decides\n and to what he decides, chosen rather than choosing. Since they are\n unable to be their own master, they allow themselves to be fixed,\n tossed about, carried away, scattered and put to flight, incapable of\n choosing - if choice there be - between success in and in relation to\n the world, and the World. All this does not constitute an error; wan-\n dering (errance) commands it. \n Galactic irony is watching us. \n Dream of a shadow and dispenser of light, conquistador and\n deserter of the World, pawn and pioneer, man sets out to conquer\n the stars and he ploughs the sea. The assault he launches against the\n astral earth and against the celestial stars is not without disaster.\n Whether he delves into analysis and disintegration - since he needs\n analyses, concrete and tangible solutions and experimentations - or\n whether he plunges into syntheses - since the abstracting power and\n the ungraspable attract him equally -, as precisely and as far as he\n may cast his nets, what his nets catch and what passes through them\n communicate. Never quite awake and never quite beclouded, will we\n learn to live and to see beings and things simultaneously from close\n up and far away, large and small, in their and in our wandering\n (errance), in the great World which is at the same time small, where\n there are no victors - would there be vanquished?\n\n## The Techno-Galactic Software Observatory\n\nIn the summer of 2017, around thirty people gathered in Brussels to explore practices of proximate critique with and of software in the context of a worksession entitled \"Techno-Galactic Software Observatory\".[^]{Worksessions are intensive transdisciplinary moments, organised twice a year by Constant. They aim to provide conditions for participants with different experiences and capabilities to temporarily link their practice and to  develop ideas, prototypes and  research projects together. For the worksessions, primarily Free, Libre and Open Source software is used and material that is available under Open Content Licenses.} The worksession called for software-curious people of all kinds to ask questions about software. The intuition behind such a call was that different types of engagement requires a heterogeneous group of participants with different levels of expertise,  skill and background. During three sessions of two days, participants collectively inspected the space-time of computation and probed the universe of hardware-software separations through excursions, exercises and conversations. They tried out various perspectives and methods to look at the larger picture of software as a concept, as a practice, and as a set of techniques.\n\nThe first two days of The Techno-Galactic Software Observatory included visits to the Musée de l'Informatique Pionnière en Belgique [^]{http://www.nam-ip.be} in Namur and the Computermuseum KULeuven[^]{http://www.etwie.be/database/actor/computermuseum-ku-leuven}. In the surroundings of these collections of historical ’numerical artefacts’, we started viewing software in a long-term context. It was an occasion to reflect on the conditions of its appearance, and allowed us to take on current-day questions from a genealogical perspective. What is software? How did it appear as a concept, in what industrial and governmental circumstances? What happens to the material conditions of its production (minerals, factory labor, hardware) when it evaporates into a cloud?\n\nThe second two days we focused on the space-time dimension of IT development. The way computer programs and operating systems are manufactured changed tremendously through time, and so did its production times and places. From military labs via the mega-corporation cubicles to the open-space freelancer utopia, what ruptures and continuities can be traced in the production, deployment, maintenance and destruction of software? From time-sharing to user-space partitions and containerization, what separations were and are at work? Where and when is software made today?\n\n## The Walk-in Clinic\n\nThe last two days at the Techno-galactic software observatory were dedicated to observation and its consequences. The development of software encompasses a series of practices whose evocative names are increasingly familiar: feedback, report, probe, audit, inspect, scan, diagnose, explore, test ... What are the systems of knowledge and power within which these activities take place, and what other types of observation are possible? As a practical set for our investigations, we set up a walk-in clinic on the 25th floor of the World Trade Center, where users and developers could arrive with software-questions of all kinds.\n\n> Do you suffer from the disappearance of your software into the cloud,\n> feel oppressed by unequal user privilege, or experience the torment of\n> software-ransom of any sort?\n> Bring your devices and interfaces to the World Trade Center!\n> With the help of a clear and in-depth session, at the Techno-Galactic\n> Walk-In Clinic we guarantee immediate results.\n> The  Walk-In Clinic provides free hands-on observations to software\n> curious  people of all kinds. A wide range of professional and amateur \n> practitioners will provide you with Software-as-a-Critique-as-a-Service\n> on the spot. Available services range from immediate interface critique, \n> collaborative code inspection, data dowsing, various forms of network\n> analyses, unusability testing, identification of unknown viruses,\n> risk assessment, opening of black-boxes and more.\n> Free software observations provided.\n> Last intake at 16:45.\n> [^]{Invitation to the Walk-In Clinic, June 2017}\n\n% On the following

Observation\n==========================================\n\n> I am less interested in the critical practice of reflection, of showing once-again that the emperor has no clothes, than in finding a way to diffract critical inquiry in order to make difference patterns in a more worldly way.\n> [@haraway:1996:witness]\n% p429, Haraway, modest witness, 1996 from: http://observatory.constantvzw.org/etherdump/friday.md.diff.html\n\n \nA spectre is haunting the galaxy. It is neither revolutionary [marx:1848:cmanifesto] nor is it a global scale vulnerability [meltdown:2018:spectre17], but no matter where you happen to be, there is the spectre of a software running somewhere in the background. Look! There it is, looking right back at you. Be it your phone screen or a passing satellite, software's observation and entanglement in the everyday feels complete. \n\nBut is it really? The Techno-Galactic Software Survival Guide is an obsessive fantasy of optimization turned on its head, and stuck to the ceiling of a self-reflecting elevator. It is the ultimate book of dos and don'ts, of forgotten histories and un-inevitable futures, of mindful agile presences and improvisational service architectures, and all that you can and cannot imagine needing in a techno-galaxy. Reading is not enough, software is not just a text, observation is one potential beginning, engagement is tickling.\n\n\nWith the rediscovery of online services in the 90s [@haigh:2001:soft60], the use of software has increasingly been knitted into the production of software, even while the rhetoric, rights and procedures continue to suggest that use and production constitute separate realms. This knitting together and its corresponding disavowal has an effect on the way software is used and produced that radically alters its operative role in society. The shifts ripple across galaxies, through social structures, working conditions and personal relations, resulting in a profusion of apparatuses aspiring to be seamless while optimizing and monetizing individual and collective flows of information in line with the interests of a handful of actors. The diffusion of software services affects the personal, in the form of intensified identity shaping and self-management. It also affects the public, as more and more libraries, universities and public infrastructures as well as the management of public life rely on \"solutions\" provided by private companies. Centralizing data flows in the clouds, services blur the last traces of the thin line that separates bio- from necro-politics.\n\n\nGiven how fast software resonates and reproduces, there is a growing urgency to engage it in manners that goes beyond taking a distance, and that deal with the fact that we are inevitably already entangled. How can we interact, respond and think with software? What approaches can we use to recognize the agency of different actors, their ways of working and their politics? What methods of observation are conducive to critical inquiry and affirmative discord? What techniques can we apply to resurface software, finding the sites where software infrastructure are reconfiguring the everyday? How can we remember that software is always at work, especially where it is designed to disappear into the background? \n\nWe pick up the word \"observation\", turning it over and around. We are looking forward to a better look , holding all of the stories of people looking at people in mind, holding terminals and keyboards in hand. We sync our breath to the rhythm of our software. We look at this wholistic observation as a way to approach software, as one way to organize engagement with its implications. Observation, and the Enabling of it intensively through data-centric Feedback Mechanisms, is share of the cybernetic spell That underpin s present day software production. Our aim was ??to scrutinize this methodology in its many manifestations, including in \"observatories\" - high cost infrastructures of observation troubled by colonial, imperial, empirical traditions and their problematic divisions of nature and culture. And through scrutiny, what do you think about who gets to watch software (and how) and who is being observed by software (and with what impact)? It is a question of power, one that we answer, at least in part, with critical play. But also with slow pedagogy.\n\nWe pick up the word \"observation\", turning it over and around. We bring it right up to our noses and hold it outstretched to get a better look, holding all of the histories of people looking at other people in mind, holding terminals and keyboards in hand. We sync our breath to the rhythm of our software. We propose holistic observation as a way to approach software, as one way to organize engagement with its implications. Observation, and the enabling of it through intensive data-centric feedback mechanisms, is part of the cybernetic spells that underpin present day software production. Our aim was to scrutinize this methodology in its many manifestations, including in \"observatories\" -- high cost infrastructures of observation troubled by colonial, imperial, empirical traditions and their problematic divisions of nature and culture. And through scrutiny, we hope to open up a set of questions about who gets to observe software (and how) and who is being observed by software (and with what impact)? It is a question of power, one that we answer, at least in part, with critical play. But also with slow pedagogy.\n\nWe respond by cargo cult programming \nwe name the actors, we reject the hierarchies of knowledge, deflect erasures, \nsome call this cargo-culting, we call it method, rejecting their colonial presumption that functionality is the only purpose, and expertise is the only source of knowlede misunderstanding\ncriteria for inclusion\nritual includsion of code with no real purpose, we reject optimization as the only value \nritual of shotgun debugging or deep magic\nwe reopen the questio unnecessary \nself-explanatory \n\nCargo cult programming is a style of computer programming characterized by the ritual inclusion of code or program structures that serve no real purpose. Cargo cult programming is typically symptomatic of a programmer not understanding either a bug they were attempting to solve or the apparent solution (compare shotgun debugging, deep magic).[1] The term cargo cult programmer may apply when an unskilled or novice computer programmer (or one inexperienced with the problem at hand) copies some program code from one place to another with little or no understanding of how it works or whether it is required in its new position.\nCargo cult programming can also refer to the results of applying a design pattern or coding style blindly without understanding the reasons behind that design principle. Examples are adding unnecessary comments to self-explanatory code, overzealous adherence to the conventions of a specific programming paradigm, or adding deletion code for objects that garbage collection would have collected automatically.\n\ngold:\n\nTogether we picked up the word \"observation\", turning it over and around. We are here to help you get a better look, holding all of the stories of people looking for people in mind, holding terminals and keyboards in hand. We see how to approach the software, how to organize and engage with its implications. Observation, and the enabling of it through intensive data-centric feedback mechanisms, is part of the cybernetic principles that underpin present day software production.\n\n\nWe are techno-galactic as we meet the contemporary paradigms of computation that proudly announce their capability for \"scaling up to the universe.\" We stand here as modest witnesses to the scales of software communities and related political economies that involve and require observation.\n\nThis guide offers a set of practical and fantastical tools for the tactical (mis)use of software, empowering/enabling users to resist embedded paradigms and assumptions. It is a collection of methods for approaching software, experiencing its myths and realities, its risks and benefits. Drawing on theories of software and computation developed in academia and elsewhere, we grounded our methods in hands-on exercises and experiments that you now can try at home. This Guide to Techno-Galactic Software Observation offers methods developed in and inspired by the context of software production, hacker culture, software studies, computer science research, Free Software communities, privacy activism, and artistic practice. It invites you to experiment with ways to stay with the trouble of software. Come join us at the edge of the universe, on the metro platform, at your kitchen table, as we mark and measure critical distances from and entanglements with the seemingly endless software systems that surround us.\n\nThe techno-galactic software survival guide was collectively produced as an outcome of the Techno-Galactic Software Observatory. \n[This feels like it could be in a different font size or in brackets or is the start of the next page/spread?]\n\n\nRemaining thoughts/notes for inspiration:\nYou may want to just throw all your devices away, but before you do so, wouldn't you want to, for once poke them back?\nYou may think about retreating to a wooden cabin, and live a software-free life, but even then, do you think you could manage without talking about your past software troubles.\nAnd, how about those drawings at the nearby cave, that look eerily similar to an ancient flowchart, you think you can just ignore its poetry?\n\nkostas axelos, planetary interlude, maybe some bits fit with the intro?:\n\n We open ourselves to abysses and we are swallowed up in sys-\n tems and totalizations - for these are fragments and segments of\n \"totality\" which establish themselves as total and/or partial totali-\n tarisms - without foreseeing what might be the home, the house, the\n habitat of living, thinking man, an unfinished, unfinishable being in a\n history which is equally so, neither a shell stuck fast to a rock, nor a\n simple nomad or vagabond. Mortals wish for the familiar and for\n adventure, the known and the unknown, undecided as to who decides\n and to what he decides, chosen rather than choosing. Since they are\n unable to be their own master, they allow themselves to be fixed,\n tossed about, carried away, scattered and put to flight, incapable of\n choosing - if choice there be - between success in and in relation to\n the world, and the World. All this does not constitute an error; wan-\n dering (errance) commands it. \n Galactic irony is watching us. \n Dream of a shadow and dispenser of light, conquistador and\n deserter of the World, pawn and pioneer, man sets out to conquer\n the stars and he ploughs the sea. The assault he launches against the\n astral earth and against the celestial stars is not without disaster.\n Whether he delves into analysis and disintegration - since he needs\n analyses, concrete and tangible solutions and experimentations - or\n whether he plunges into syntheses - since the abstracting power and\n the ungraspable attract him equally -, as precisely and as far as he\n may cast his nets, what his nets catch and what passes through them\n communicate. Never quite awake and never quite beclouded, will we\n learn to live and to see beings and things simultaneously from close\n up and far away, large and small, in their and in our wandering\n (errance), in the great World which is at the same time small, where\n there are no victors - would there be vanquished?\n\n## The Techno-Galactic Software Observatory\n\nIn the summer of 2017, around thirty people gathered in Brussels to explore practices of proximate critique with and of software in the context of a worksession entitled \"Techno-Galactic Software Observatory\".[^]{Worksessions are intensive transdisciplinary moments, organised twice a year by Constant. They aim to provide conditions for participants with different experiences and capabilities to temporarily link their practice and to  develop ideas, prototypes and  research projects together. For the worksessions, primarily Free, Libre and Open Source software is used and material that is available under Open Content Licenses.} The worksession called for software-curious people of all kinds to ask questions about software. The intuition behind such a call was that different types of engagement requires a heterogeneous group of participants with different levels of expertise,  skill and background. During three sessions of two days, participants collectively inspected the space-time of computation and probed the universe of hardware-software separations through excursions, exercises and conversations. They tried out various perspectives and methods to look at the larger picture of software as a concept, as a practice, and as a set of techniques.\n\nThe first two days of The Techno-Galactic Software Observatory included visits to the Musée de l'Informatique Pionnière en Belgique [^]{http://www.nam-ip.be} in Namur and the Computermuseum KULeuven[^]{http://www.etwie.be/database/actor/computermuseum-ku-leuven}. In the surroundings of these collections of historical ’numerical artefacts’, we started viewing software in a long-term context. It was an occasion to reflect on the conditions of its appearance, and allowed us to take on current-day questions from a genealogical perspective. What is software? How did it appear as a concept, in what industrial and governmental circumstances? What happens to the material conditions of its production (minerals, factory labor, hardware) when it evaporates into a cloud?\n\nThe second two days we focused on the space-time dimension of IT development. The way computer programs and operating systems are manufactured changed tremendously through time, and so did its production times and places. From military labs via the mega-corporation cubicles to the open-space freelancer utopia, what ruptures and continuities can be traced in the production, deployment, maintenance and destruction of software? From time-sharing to user-space partitions and containerization, what separations were and are at work? Where and when is software made today?\n\n## The Walk-in Clinic\n\nThe last two days at the Techno-galactic software observatory were dedicated to observation and its consequences. The development of software encompasses a series of practices whose evocative names are increasingly familiar: feedback, report, probe, audit, inspect, scan, diagnose, explore, test ... What are the systems of knowledge and power within which these activities take place, and what other types of observation are possible? As a practical set for our investigations, we set up a walk-in clinic on the 25th floor of the World Trade Center, where users and developers could arrive with software-questions of all kinds.\n\n> Do you suffer from the disappearance of your software into the cloud,\n> feel oppressed by unequal user privilege, or experience the torment of\n> software-ransom of any sort?\n> Bring your devices and interfaces to the World Trade Center!\n> With the help of a clear and in-depth session, at the Techno-Galactic\n> Walk-In Clinic we guarantee immediate results.\n> The  Walk-In Clinic provides free hands-on observations to software\n> curious  people of all kinds. A wide range of professional and amateur \n> practitioners will provide you with Software-as-a-Critique-as-a-Service\n> on the spot. Available services range from immediate interface critique, \n> collaborative code inspection, data dowsing, various forms of network\n> analyses, unusability testing, identification of unknown

stuck fast to a rock, nor a\n simple nomad or vagabond. Mortals wish for the familiar and for\n adventure, the known and the unknown, undecided as to who decides\n and to what he decides, chosen rather than choosing. Since they are\n unable to be their own master, they allow themselves to be fixed,\n tossed about, carried away, scattered and put to flight, incapable of\n choosing - if choice there be - between success in and in relation to\n the world, and the World. All this does not constitute an error; wan-\n dering (errance) commands it. \n Dream of a shadow and dispenser of light, conquistador and\n deserter of the World, pawn and pioneer, man sets out to conquer\n the stars and he ploughs the sea.

TOCTITLE: Introduction\n\nA Guide to Techno-Galactic Software Observation\n==========================================\n\n> I am less interested in the critical practice of reflection, of showing once-again that the emperor has no clothes, than in finding a way to diffract critical inquiry in order to make difference patterns in a more worldly way.\n> [@haraway:1996:witness]\n% p429, Haraway, modest witness, 1996 from: http://observatory.constantvzw.org/etherdump/friday.md.diff.html\n\n \nA spectre is haunting the galaxy. It is neither revolutionary [marx:1848:cmanifesto] nor is it a global scale vulnerability [meltdown:2018:spectre17], but no matter where you happen to be, there is the spectre of a software running somewhere in the background. Look! There it is, looking right back at you. Be it your phone screen or a passing satellite, software's observation and entanglement in the everyday feels complete. \n\nBut is it really? The Techno-Galactic Software Survival Guide is an obsessive fantasy of optimization turned on its head, and stuck to the ceiling of a self-reflecting elevator. It is the ultimate book of dos and don'ts, of forgotten histories and un-inevitable futures, of mindful agile presences and improvisational service architectures, and all that you can and cannot imagine needing in a techno-galaxy. Reading is not enough, software is not just a text, observation is one potential beginning, engagement is tickling.\n\n\nWith the rediscovery of online services in the 1990s [@haigh:2001:soft60], the use of software has increasingly been knitted into the production of software, even while the rhetoric, rights and procedures continue to suggest that use and production constitute separate realms. This knitting together and its corresponding disavowal has an effect on the way software is used and produced that radically alters its operative role in society. The shifts ripple across galaxies, through social structures, working conditions and personal relations, resulting in a profusion of apparatuses aspiring to be seamless while optimizing and monetizing individual and collective flows of information in line with the interests of a handful of actors. The diffusion of software services affects the personal, in the form of intensified identity shaping and self-management. It also affects the public, as more and more libraries, universities and public infrastructures as well as the management of public life rely on \"solutions\" provided by private companies. Centralizing data flows in the clouds, services blur the last traces of the thin line that separates bio- from necro-politics.\n\n\nGiven how fast software resonates and reproduces, there is a growing urgency to engage with it in manners that goes beyond taking a distance, and that deal with the fact that we are inevitably already entangled % CARLINSAYS: repetitive?. How can we interact, respond and think with software? What approaches can we use to recognize the agency of different actors, their ways of working and their politics? What methods of observation are conducive to critical inquiry and affirmative discord? What techniques can we apply to resurface software, finding the sites where software infrastructure are reconfiguring the everyday? How can we remember that software is always at work, especially where it is designed to disappear into the background? \n\nWe pick up the word \"observation\", turning it over and around. We are looking forward to a better look , holding all of the stories of people looking at people in mind, holding terminals and keyboards in hand. We sync our breath to the rhythm of our software. We look at this wholistic observation as a way to approach software, as one way to organize engagement with its implications. Observation, and the Enabling of it intensively through data-centric Feedback Mechanisms, is share of the cybernetic spell That underpin s present day software production. Our aim was ??to scrutinize this methodology in its many manifestations, including in \"observatories\" - high cost infrastructures of observation troubled by colonial, imperial, empirical traditions and their problematic divisions of nature and culture. And through scrutiny, what do you think about who gets to watch software (and how) and who is being observed by software (and with what impact)? It is a question of power, one that we answer, at least in part, with critical play. But also with slow pedagogy.\n\nWe pick up the word \"observation\", turning it over and around. We bring it right up to our noses and hold it outstretched to get a better look, holding all of the histories of people looking at other people in mind, holding terminals and keyboards in hand. We sync our breath to the rhythm of our software. We propose holistic observation as a way to approach software, as one way to organize engagement with its implications. Observation, and the enabling of it through intensive data-centric feedback mechanisms, is part of the cybernetic spells that underpin present day software production.\n\nWe respond by cargo cult programming \nwe name the actors, we reject the hierarchies of knowledge, deflect erasures, \nsome call this cargo-culting, we call it method, rejecting their colonial presumption that functionality is the only purpose, and expertise is the only source of knowlede misunderstanding\ncriteria for inclusion\nritual includsion of code with no real purpose, we reject optimization as the only value \nritual of shotgun debugging or deep magic\nWe question the naming of the non functional as unnecessary, we question the description of code as self-explanatory \n\n\nOur aim was to scrutinize this methodology in its many manifestations, including in \"observatories\" -- high cost infrastructures of observation troubled by colonial, imperial, empirical traditions and their problematic divisions of nature and culture. And through scrutiny, we hope to open up a set of questions about who gets to observe software (and how) and who is being observed by software (and with what impact)? It is a question of power, one that we answer, at least in part, with critical play. But also with slow pedagogy.\n\n\n\n\ngold:\n\nTogether we picked up the word \"observation\", turning it over and around. We are here to help you get a better look, holding all of the stories of people looking for people in mind, holding terminals and keyboards in hand. We see how to approach the software, how to organize and engage with its implications. Observation, and the enabling of it through intensive data-centric feedback mechanisms, is part of the cybernetic principles that underpin present day software production.\n\n\nWe are techno-galactic as we meet the contemporary paradigms of computation that proudly announce their capability for \"scaling up to the universe.\" We stand here as modest witnesses to the scales of software communities and related political economies that involve and require observation.\n\nThis guide offers a set of practical and fantastical tools for the tactical (mis)use of software, empowering/enabling users to resist embedded paradigms and assumptions. It is a collection of methods for approaching software, experiencing its myths and realities, its risks and benefits. Drawing on theories of software and computation developed in academia and elsewhere, we grounded our methods in hands-on exercises and experiments that you now can try at home. This Guide to Techno-Galactic Software Observation offers methods developed in and inspired by the context of software production, hacker culture, software studies, computer science research, Free Software communities, privacy activism, and artistic practice. It invites you to experiment with ways to stay with the trouble of software. Come join us at the edge of the universe, on the metro platform, at your kitchen table, as we mark and measure critical distances from and entanglements with the seemingly endless software systems that surround us.\n\nThe techno-galactic software survival guide was collectively produced as an outcome of the Techno-Galactic Software Observatory. \n[This feels like it could be in a different font size or in brackets or is the start of the next page/spread?]\n\n\nRemaining thoughts/notes for inspiration:\nYou may want to just throw all your devices away, but before you do so, wouldn't you want to, for once poke them back?\nYou may think about retreating to a wooden cabin, and live a software-free life, but even then, do you think you could manage without talking about your past software troubles.\nAnd, how about those drawings at the nearby cave, that look eerily similar to an ancient flowchart, you think you can just ignore its poetry?\n\nkostas axelos, planetary interlude, maybe some bits fit with the intro?:\n\n We open ourselves to abysses and we are swallowed up in sys-\n tems and totalizations - for these are fragments and segments of\n \"totality\" which establish themselves as total and/or partial totali-\n tarisms - without foreseeing what might be the home, the house, the\n habitat of living, thinking man, an unfinished, unfinishable being in a\n history which is equally so, neither a shell stuck fast to a rock, nor a\n simple nomad or vagabond. Mortals wish for the familiar and for\n adventure, the known and the unknown, undecided as to who decides\n and to what he decides, chosen rather than choosing. Since they are\n unable to be their own master, they allow themselves to be fixed,\n tossed about, carried away, scattered and put to flight, incapable of\n choosing - if choice there be - between success in and in relation to\n the world, and the World. All this does not constitute an error; wan-\n dering (errance) commands it. \n Galactic irony is watching us. \n Dream of a shadow and dispenser of light, conquistador and\n deserter of the World, pawn and pioneer, man sets out to conquer\n the stars and he ploughs the sea. The assault he launches against the\n astral earth and against the celestial stars is not without disaster.\n Whether he delves into analysis and disintegration - since he needs\n analyses, concrete and tangible solutions and experimentations - or\n whether he plunges into syntheses - since the abstracting power and\n the ungraspable attract him equally -, as precisely and as far as he\n may cast his nets, what his nets catch and what passes through them\n communicate. Never quite awake and never quite beclouded, will we\n learn to live and to see beings and things simultaneously from close\n up and far away, large and small, in their and in our wandering\n (errance), in the great World which is at the same time small, where\n there are no victors - would there be vanquished?\n\n## The Techno-Galactic Software Observatory\n\nIn the summer of 2017, around thirty people gathered in Brussels to explore practices of proximate critique with and of software in the context of a worksession entitled \"Techno-Galactic Software Observatory\".[^]{Worksessions are intensive transdisciplinary moments, organised twice a year by Constant. They aim to provide conditions for participants with different experiences and capabilities to temporarily link their practice and to  develop ideas, prototypes and  research projects together. For the worksessions, primarily Free, Libre and Open Source software is used and material that is available under Open Content Licenses.} The worksession called for software-curious people of all kinds to ask questions about software. The intuition behind such a call was that different types of engagement requires a heterogeneous group of participants with different levels of expertise,  skill and background. During three sessions of two days, participants collectively inspected the space-time of computation and probed the universe of hardware-software separations through excursions, exercises and conversations. They tried out various perspectives and methods to look at the larger picture of software as a concept, as a practice, and as a set of techniques.\n\nThe first two days of The Techno-Galactic Software Observatory included visits to the Musée de l'Informatique Pionnière en Belgique [^]{http://www.nam-ip.be} in Namur and the Computermuseum KULeuven[^]{http://www.etwie.be/database/actor/computermuseum-ku-leuven}. In the surroundings of these collections of historical ’numerical artefacts’, we started viewing software in a long-term context. It was an occasion to reflect on the conditions of its appearance, and allowed us to take on current-day questions from a genealogical perspective. What is software? How did it appear as a concept, in what industrial and governmental circumstances? What happens to the material conditions of its production (minerals, factory labor, hardware) when it evaporates into a cloud?\n\nThe second two days we focused on the space-time dimension of IT development. The way computer programs and operating systems are manufactured changed tremendously through time, and so did its production times and places. From military labs via the mega-corporation cubicles to the open-space freelancer utopia, what ruptures and continuities can be traced in the production, deployment, maintenance and destruction of software? From time-sharing to user-space partitions and containerization, what separations were and are at work? Where and when is software made today?\n\n## The Walk-in Clinic\n\nThe last two days at the Techno-galactic software observatory were dedicated to observation and its consequences. The development of software encompasses a series of practices whose evocative names are increasingly familiar: feedback, report, probe, audit, inspect, scan, diagnose, explore, test ... What are the systems of knowledge and power within which these activities take place, and what other types of observation are possible? As a practical set for our investigations, we set up a walk-in clinic on the 25th floor of the World Trade Center, where users and developers could arrive with software-questions of all kinds.\n\n> Do you suffer from the disappearance of your software into the cloud,\n> feel oppressed by unequal user privilege, or experience the torment of\n> software-ransom of any sort?\n> Bring your devices and interfaces to the World Trade Center!\n> With the help of a clear and in-depth session, at the Techno-Galactic\n> Walk-In Clinic we guarantee immediate results.\n> The  Walk-In Clinic provides free hands-on observations to software\n> curious  people of all kinds. A wide range of professional and amateur \n> practitioners will provide you with Software-as-a-Critique-as-a-Service\n> on the spot. Available services range from immediate interface critique, \n> collaborative code inspection, data dowsing, various forms of network\n> analyses, unusability testing, identification of unknown viruses,\n> risk assessment, opening of black-boxes and more.\n> Free software observations provided.\n> Last intake at 16:45.\n> [^]{Invitation to the Walk-In Clinic, June 2017}\n\n% On the following

TOCIT: Introduction\n\nA Guide to Techno-Galactic Software Observation\n==========================================\n\n> I am less interested in the critical practice of reflection,\n> of showing once-again that the emperor has no clothes, than in\n> finding a way to diffract critical inquiry in order to make\n> difference patterns in a more worldly way.\n> [@haraway:1996:witness]\n% p429, Haraway, modest witness, 1996 from: http://observatory.constantvzw.org/etherdump/friday.md.diff.html\n\n \nA spectre is haunting the galaxy. It is neither revolutionary [@marx:1848:cmanifesto] nor is it a global scale vulnerability [@meltdown:2018:spectre17], but no matter where you happen to be, there is the spectre of a software running somewhere in the background. Look! There it is, looking right back at you. Be it your phone screen or a passing satellite, software's observation and entanglement in the everyday feels complete. \n\nBut is it really? The Techno-Galactic Software Survival Guide is an obsessive fantasy of optimization turned on its head, and stuck to the ceiling of a self-reflecting elevator. It is the ultimate book of dos and don'ts, of forgotten histories and un-inevitable futures, of mindful agile presences and improvisational service architectures, and all that you can and cannot imagine needing in a techno-galaxy. Reading is not enough, software is not just a text, observation is one potential beginning, engagement is tickling.\n\nWith the rediscovery of online services in the 1990s [@haigh:2001:soft60], the use of software has increasingly been knitted into the production of software, even while the rhetoric, rights and procedures continue to suggest that use and production constitute separate realms. This knitting together and its corresponding disavowal has an effect on the way software is used and produced that radically alters its operative role in society. The shifts ripple across galaxies, through social structures, working conditions and personal relations, resulting in a profusion of apparatuses aspiring to be seamless while optimizing and monetizing individual and collective flows of information in line with the interests of a handful of actors. The diffusion of software services affects the personal, in the form of intensified identity shaping and self-management. It also affects the public, as more and more libraries, universities and public infrastructures as well as the management of public life rely on \"solutions\" provided by private companies. Centralizing data flows in the clouds, services blur the last traces of the thin line that separates bio- from necro-politics.\n\n\nGiven how fast software resonates and reproduces, there is a growing urgency to engage with it in manners that goes beyond taking a distance, and that deal with the fact that we are inevitably already entangled. (% CARLINSAYS: repetitive?) How can we interact, respond and think with software? What approaches can we use to recognize the agency of different actors, their ways of working and their politics? What methods of observation are conducive to critical inquiry and affirmative discord? What techniques can we apply to resurface software, finding the sites where their infrastructures are reconfiguring the everyday? How can we remember that software is always at work, especially where it is designed to disappear into the background? \n\nWe pick up the word \"observation\", turning it over and around. (% CARLINSAYS: use past tense?) We are looking forward to a better look , holding all of the stories of people looking at people in mind, holding terminals and keyboards in hand. We sync our breath to the rhythm of our software. We look at this wholistic observation as a way to approach software, as one way to organize engagement with its implications. Observation, and the Enabling of it intensively through data-centric Feedback Mechanisms, is share of the cybernetic spell That underpin s present day software production. Our aim was ??to scrutinize this methodology in its many manifestations, including in \"observatories\" - high cost infrastructures of observation troubled by colonial, imperial, empirical traditions and their problematic divisions of nature and culture. And through scrutiny, what do you think about who gets to watch software (and how) and who is being observed by software (and with what impact)? It is a question of power, one that we answer, at least in part, with critical play. But also with slow pedagogy.\n\nWe pick up the word \"observation\", turning it over and around. We bring it right up to our noses and hold it outstretched to get a better look, holding all of the histories of people looking at other people in mind, holding terminals and keyboards in hand. We sync our breath to the rhythm of our software. We propose holistic observation as a way to approach software, as one way to organize engagement with its implications. Observation, and the enabling of it through intensive data-centric feedback mechanisms, is part of the cybernetic spells that underpin present day software production.\n\nWe respond by cargo cult programming \nwe name the actors, we reject the hierarchies of knowledge, deflect erasures, \nsome call this cargo-culting, we call it method, rejecting their colonial presumption that functionality is the only purpose, and expertise is the only source of knowlede misunderstanding\ncriteria for inclusion\nritual includsion of code with no real purpose, we reject optimization as the only value \nritual of shotgun debugging or deep magic\nWe question the naming of the non functional as unnecessary, we question the description of code as self-explanatory \n\n\nOur aim was to scrutinize this methodology in its many manifestations, including in \"observatories\" -- high cost infrastructures of observation troubled by colonial, imperial, empirical traditions and their problematic divisions of nature and culture. And through scrutiny, we hope to open up a set of questions about who gets to observe software (and how) and who is being observed by software (and with what impact)? It is a question of power, one that we answer, at least in part, with critical play. But also with slow pedagogy.\n\n\n\n\ngold:\n\nTogether we picked up the word \"observation\", turning it over and around. We are here to help you get a better look, holding all of the stories of people looking for people in mind, holding terminals and keyboards in hand. We see how to approach the software, how to organize and engage with its implications. Observation, and the enabling of it through intensive data-centric feedback mechanisms, is part of the cybernetic principles that underpin present day software production.\n\n\nWe are techno-galactic as we meet the contemporary paradigms of computation that proudly announce their capability for \"scaling up to the universe.\" We stand here as modest witnesses to the scales of software communities and related political economies that involve and require observation.\n\nThis guide offers a set of practical and fantastical tools for the tactical (mis)use of software, empowering/enabling users to resist embedded paradigms and assumptions. It is a collection of methods for approaching software, experiencing its myths and realities, its risks and benefits. Drawing on theories of software and computation developed in academia and elsewhere, we grounded our methods in hands-on exercises and experiments that you now can try at home. This Guide to Techno-Galactic Software Observation offers methods developed in and inspired by the context of software production, hacker culture, software studies, computer science research, Free Software communities, privacy activism, and artistic practice. It invites you to experiment with ways to stay with the trouble of software. Come join us at the edge of the universe, on the metro platform, at your kitchen table, as we mark and measure critical distances from and entanglements with the seemingly endless software systems that surround us.\n\nThe techno-galactic software survival guide was collectively produced as an outcome of the Techno-Galactic Software Observatory. \n[This feels like it could be in a different font size or in brackets or is the start of the next page/spread?]\n\n\nRemaining thoughts/notes for inspiration:\nYou may want to just throw all your devices away, but before you do so, wouldn't you want to, for once poke them back?\nYou may think about retreating to a wooden cabin, and live a software-free life, but even then, do you think you could manage without talking about your past software troubles.\nAnd, how about those drawings at the nearby cave, that look eerily similar to an ancient flowchart, you think you can just ignore its poetry?\n\nkostas axelos, planetary interlude, maybe some bits fit with the intro?:\n\n%  We open ourselves to abysses and we are swallowed up in sys-\n%  tems and totalizations - for these are fragments and segments of\n%  \"totality\" which establish themselves as total and/or partial totali-\n%  tarisms - without foreseeing what might be the home, the house, the\n%  habitat of living, thinking man, an unfinished, unfinishable being in a\n%  history which is equally so, neither a shell stuck fast to a rock, nor a\n%  simple nomad or vagabond. Mortals wish for the familiar and for\n%  adventure, the known and the unknown, undecided as to who decides\n%  and to what he decides, chosen rather than choosing. Since they are\n%  unable to be their own master, they allow themselves to be fixed,\n%  tossed about, carried away, scattered and put to flight, incapable of\n%  choosing - if choice there be - between success in and in relation to\n%  the world, and the World. All this does not constitute an error; wan-\n%  dering (errance) commands it. \n Galactic irony is watching us. \n%  Dream of a shadow and dispenser of light, conquistador and\n%  deserter of the World, pawn and pioneer, man sets out to conquer\n%  the stars and he ploughs the sea. The assault he launches against the\n%  astral earth and against the celestial stars is not without disaster.\n Whether he delves into analysis and disintegration - since he needs\n analyses, concrete and tangible solutions and experimentations - or\n whether he plunges into syntheses - since the abstracting power and\n the ungraspable attract him equally -, as precisely and as far as he\n may cast his nets, what his nets catch and what passes through them\n communicate. Never quite awake and never quite beclouded, will we\n learn to live and to see beings and things simultaneously from close\n up and far away, large and small, in their and in our wandering\n (errance), in the great World which is at the same time small, where\n there are no victors - would there be vanquished?\n\n## The Techno-Galactic Software Observatory\n\nIn the summer of 2017, around thirty people gathered in Brussels to explore practices of proximate critique with and of software in the context of a worksession entitled \"Techno-Galactic Software Observatory\".[^]{Worksessions are intensive transdisciplinary moments, organised twice a year by Constant. They aim to provide conditions for participants with different experiences and capabilities to temporarily link their practice and to  develop ideas, prototypes and  research projects together. For the worksessions, primarily Free, Libre and Open Source software is used and material that is available under Open Content Licenses.} The worksession called for software-curious people of all kinds to ask questions about software. The intuition behind such a call was that different types of engagement requires a heterogeneous group of participants with different levels of expertise,  skill and background. During three sessions of two days, participants collectively inspected the space-time of computation and probed the universe of hardware-software separations through excursions, exercises and conversations. They tried out various perspectives and methods to look at the larger picture of software as a concept, as a practice, and as a set of techniques.\n\nThe first two days of The Techno-Galactic Software Observatory included visits to the Musée de l'Informatique Pionnière en Belgique [^]{http://www.nam-ip.be} in Namur and the Computermuseum KULeuven[^]{http://www.etwie.be/database/actor/computermuseum-ku-leuven}. In the surroundings of these collections of historical ’numerical artefacts’, we started viewing software in a long-term context. It was an occasion to reflect on the conditions of its appearance, and allowed us to take on current-day questions from a genealogical perspective. What is software? How did it appear as a concept, in what industrial and governmental circumstances? What happens to the material conditions of its production (minerals, factory labor, hardware) when it evaporates into a cloud?\n\nThe second two days we focused on the space-time dimension of IT development. The way computer programs and operating systems are manufactured changed tremendously through time, and so did its production times and places. From military labs via the mega-corporation cubicles to the open-space freelancer utopia, what ruptures and continuities can be traced in the production, deployment, maintenance and destruction of software? From time-sharing to user-space partitions and containerization, what separations were and are at work? Where and when is software made today?\n\n## The Walk-in Clinic\n\nThe last two days at the Techno-galactic software observatory were dedicated to observation and its consequences. The development of software encompasses a series of practices whose evocative names are increasingly familiar: feedback, report, probe, audit, inspect, scan, diagnose, explore, test ... What are the systems of knowledge and power within which these activities take place, and what other types of observation are possible? As a practical set for our investigations, we set up a walk-in clinic on the 25th floor of the World Trade Center, where users and developers could arrive with software-questions of all kinds.\n\n> Do you suffer from the disappearance of your software into the cloud,\n> feel oppressed by unequal user privilege, or experience the torment of\n> software-ransom of any sort?\n> Bring your devices and interfaces to the World Trade Center!\n> With the help of a clear and in-depth session, at the Techno-Galactic\n> Walk-In Clinic we guarantee immediate results.\n> The  Walk-In Clinic provides free hands-on observations to software\n> curious  people of all kinds. A wide range of professional and amateur \n> practitioners will provide you with Software-as-a-Critique-as-a-Service\n> on the spot. Available services range from immediate interface critique, \n> collaborative code inspection, data dowsing, various forms of network\n> analyses, unusability testing, identification of unknown viruses,\n> risk assessment, opening of black-boxes and more.\n> Free software observations provided.\n> Last intake at 16:45.\n> [^]{Invitation to the Walk-In Clinic, June 2017}\n\n% On the following

TOCITEM: Introduction\n\nA Guide to Techno-Galactic Software Observation (%CARLINSAYS: is this our title or is our title The Techno-Galactic Guide to Software Observations?)\n==========================================\n\n> I am less interested in the critical practice of reflection,\n> of showing once-again that the emperor has no clothes, than in\n> finding a way to diffract critical inquiry in order to make\n> difference patterns in a more worldly way.\n> [@haraway:1996:witness]\n% p429, Haraway, modest witness, 1996 from: http://observatory.constantvzw.org/etherdump/friday.md.diff.html\n\n \nA spectre is haunting the galaxy. It is neither revolutionary [@marx:1848:cmanifesto] nor is it a global scale vulnerability [@meltdown:2018:spectre17], but no matter where you happen to be, there is the spectre of a software running somewhere in the background. Look! There it is, looking right back at you. Be it your phone screen or a passing satellite, software's observation and entanglement in the everyday feels complete. \n\nBut is it really? The Techno-Galactic Software Survival Guide is an obsessive fantasy of optimization turned on its head, and stuck to the ceiling of a self-reflecting elevator. It is the ultimate book of dos and don'ts, of forgotten histories and un-inevitable futures, of mindful agile presences and improvisational service architectures, and all that you can and cannot imagine needing in a techno-galaxy. Reading is not enough, software is not just a text, observation is one potential beginning, engagement is tickling.\n\nWith the rediscovery of online services in the 1990s [@haigh:2001:soft60], the use of software has increasingly been knitted into the production of software, even while the rhetoric, rights and procedures continue to suggest that use and production constitute separate realms. This knitting together and its corresponding disavowal has an effect on the way software is used and produced that radically alters its operative role in society. The shifts ripple across galaxies, through social structures, working conditions and personal relations, resulting in a profusion of apparatuses aspiring to be seamless while optimizing and monetizing individual and collective flows of information in line with the interests of a handful of actors. The diffusion of software services affects the personal, in the form of intensified identity shaping and self-management. It also affects the public, as more and more libraries, universities and public infrastructures as well as the management of public life rely on \"solutions\" provided by private companies. Centralizing data flows in the clouds, services blur the last traces of the thin line that separates bio- from necro-politics.\n\n\nGiven how fast software resonates and reproduces, there is a growing urgency to engage with it in manners that goes beyond taking a distance, and that deal with the fact that we are inevitably already entangled. (% CARLINSAYS: repetitive?) How can we interact, respond and think with software? What approaches can we use to recognize the agency of different actors, their ways of working and their politics? What methods of observation are conducive to critical inquiry and affirmative discord? What techniques can we apply to resurface software, finding the sites where their infrastructures are reconfiguring the everyday? How can we remember that software is always at work, especially where it is designed to disappear into the background? \n\nWe pick up the word \"observation\", turning it over and around. (% CARLINSAYS: use past tense?) We are looking forward to a better look , holding all of the stories of people looking at people in mind, holding terminals and keyboards in hand. We sync our breath to the rhythm of our software. We look at this wholistic observation as a way to approach software, as one way to organize engagement with its implications. Observation, and the Enabling of it intensively through data-centric Feedback Mechanisms, is share of the cybernetic spell That underpin s present day software production. Our aim was ??to scrutinize this methodology in its many manifestations, including in \"observatories\" - high cost infrastructures of observation troubled by colonial, imperial, empirical traditions and their problematic divisions of nature and culture. And through scrutiny, what do you think about who gets to watch software (and how) and who is being observed by software (and with what impact)? It is a question of power, one that we answer, at least in part, with critical play. But also with slow pedagogy.\n\nWe pick up the word \"observation\", turning it over and around. We bring it right up to our noses and hold it outstretched to get a better look, holding all of the histories of people looking at other people in mind, holding terminals and keyboards in hand. We sync our breath to the rhythm of our software. We propose holistic observation as a way to approach software, as one way to organize engagement with its implications. Observation, and the enabling of it through intensive data-centric feedback mechanisms, is part of the cybernetic spells that underpin present day software production.\n\nWe respond by cargo cult programming \nwe name the actors, we reject the hierarchies of knowledge, deflect erasures, \nsome call this cargo-culting, we call it method, rejecting their colonial presumption that functionality is the only purpose, and expertise is the only source of knowlede misunderstanding\ncriteria for inclusion\nritual includsion of code with no real purpose, we reject optimization as the only value \nritual of shotgun debugging or deep magic\nWe question the naming of the non functional as unnecessary, we question the description of code as self-explanatory \n\n\nOur aim was to scrutinize this methodology in its many manifestations, including in \"observatories\" -- high cost infrastructures of observation troubled by colonial, imperial, empirical traditions and their problematic divisions of nature and culture. And through scrutiny, we hope to open up a set of questions about who gets to observe software (and how) and who is being observed by software (and with what impact)? It is a question of power, one that we answer, at least in part, with critical play. But also with slow pedagogy.\n\n\n\n\ngold:\n\nTogether we picked up the word \"observation\", turning it over and around. We are here to help you get a better look, holding all of the stories of people looking for people in mind, holding terminals and keyboards in hand. We see how to approach the software, how to organize and engage with its implications. Observation, and the enabling of it through intensive data-centric feedback mechanisms, is part of the cybernetic principles that underpin present day software production.\n\n\nWe are techno-galactic as we meet the contemporary paradigms of computation that proudly announce their capability for \"scaling up to the universe.\" We stand here as modest witnesses to the scales of software communities and related political economies that involve and require observation.\n\nThis guide offers a set of practical and fantastical tools for the tactical (mis)use of software, empowering/enabling users to resist embedded paradigms and assumptions. It is a collection of methods for approaching software, experiencing its myths and realities, its risks and benefits. Drawing on theories of software and computation developed in academia and elsewhere, we grounded our methods in hands-on exercises and experiments that you now can try at home. This Guide to Techno-Galactic Software Observation offers methods developed in and inspired by the context of software production, hacker culture, software studies, computer science research, Free Software communities, privacy activism, and artistic practice. It invites you to experiment with ways to stay with the trouble of software. Come join us at the edge of the universe, on the metro platform, at your kitchen table, as we mark and measure critical distances from and entanglements with the seemingly endless software systems that surround us.\n\nThe techno-galactic software survival guide was collectively produced as an outcome of the Techno-Galactic Software Observatory. \n[This feels like it could be in a different font size or in brackets or is the start of the next page/spread?]\n\n\nRemaining thoughts/notes for inspiration:\nYou may want to just throw all your devices away, but before you do so, wouldn't you want to, for once poke them back?\nYou may think about retreating to a wooden cabin, and live a software-free life, but even then, do you think you could manage without talking about your past software troubles.\nAnd, how about those drawings at the nearby cave, that look eerily similar to an ancient flowchart, you think you can just ignore its poetry?\n\nkostas axelos, planetary interlude, maybe some bits fit with the intro?:\n\n%  We open ourselves to abysses and we are swallowed up in sys-\n%  tems and totalizations - for these are fragments and segments of\n%  \"totality\" which establish themselves as total and/or partial totali-\n%  tarisms - without foreseeing what might be the home, the house, the\n%  habitat of living, thinking man, an unfinished, unfinishable being in a\n%  history which is equally so, neither a shell stuck fast to a rock, nor a\n%  simple nomad or vagabond. Mortals wish for the familiar and for\n%  adventure, the known and the unknown, undecided as to who decides\n%  and to what he decides, chosen rather than choosing. Since they are\n%  unable to be their own master, they allow themselves to be fixed,\n%  tossed about, carried away, scattered and put to flight, incapable of\n%  choosing - if choice there be - between success in and in relation to\n%  the world, and the World. All this does not constitute an error; wan-\n%  dering (errance) commands it. \n Galactic irony is watching us. \n%  Dream of a shadow and dispenser of light, conquistador and\n%  deserter of the World, pawn and pioneer, man sets out to conquer\n%  the stars and he ploughs the sea. The assault he launches against the\n%  astral earth and against the celestial stars is not without disaster.\n Whether he delves into analysis and disintegration -- since he needs\n analyses, concrete and tangible solutions and experimentations -- or\n whether he plunges into syntheses -- since the abstracting power and\n the ungraspable attract him equally --, as precisely and as far as he\n may cast his nets, what his nets catch and what passes through them\n communicate. Never quite awake and never quite beclouded, will we\n learn to live and to see beings and things simultaneously from close\n up and far away, large and small, in their and in our wandering\n (errance), in the great World which is at the same time small, where\n there are no victors - would there be vanquished?\n\n## The Techno-Galactic Software Observatory\n\nIn the summer of 2017, thirty or so people gathered in Brussels to explore practices of proximate critique with and of software in the context of a worksession entitled \"Techno-Galactic Software Observatory\".[^]{Worksessions are intensive transdisciplinary moments, organised twice a year by Constant. They aim to provide conditions for participants with different experiences and capabilities to temporarily link their practice and to  develop ideas, prototypes and  research projects together. For the worksessions, primarily Free, Libre and Open Source software is used and material that is available under Open Content Licenses.} The worksession called for software-curious people of all kinds to ask questions about software. The intuition behind such a call was that developing different types of engagement requires a heterogeneous group of participants with different levels of expertise,  skill and background. During three sessions that were two days each, participants collectively inspected the space-time of computation and probed the universe of hardware-software separations through excursions, exercises and conversations. They tried out various perspectives and methods to look at the larger picture of software as a concept, as a practice, and as a set of techniques.\n\nThe first two days of The Techno-Galactic Software Observatory included visits to the Musée de l'Informatique Pionnière en Belgique [^]{http://www.nam-ip.be} in Namur and the Computermuseum KULeuven[^]{http://www.etwie.be/database/actor/computermuseum-ku-leuven}. Surrounded by these collections of historical ’numerical artefacts’, we started considering software in a long-term context (% CARLINSAYS: This is n. It was an occasion to reflect on the conditions of its appearance, and allowed us to take on current-day questions from a genealogical perspective. What is software? How did it appear as a concept, in what industrial and governmental circumstances? What happens to the material conditions of its production (minerals, factory labor, hardware) when it evaporates into a cloud?\n\nThe second two days we focused on the space-time dimension of IT development. The way computer programs and operating systems are manufactured changed tremendously through time, and so did its production times and places. From military labs via the mega-corporation cubicles to the open-space freelancer utopia, what ruptures and continuities can be traced in the production, deployment, maintenance and destruction of software? From time-sharing to user-space partitions and containerization, what separations were and are at work? Where and when is software made today?\n\n## The Walk-in Clinic\n\nThe last two days at the Techno-galactic software observatory were dedicated to observation and its consequences. The development of software encompasses a series of practices whose evocative names are increasingly familiar: feedback, report, probe, audit, inspect, scan, diagnose, explore, test ... What are the systems of knowledge and power within which these activities take place, and what other types of observation are possible? As a practical set for our investigations, we set up a walk-in clinic on the 25th floor of the World Trade Center, where users and developers could arrive with software-questions of all kinds.\n\n> Do you suffer from the disappearance of your software into the cloud,\n> feel oppressed by unequal user privilege, or experience the torment of\n> software-ransom of any sort?\n> Bring your devices and interfaces to the World Trade Center!\n> With the help of a clear and in-depth session, at the Techno-Galactic\n> Walk-In Clinic we guarantee immediate results.\n> The  Walk-In Clinic provides free hands-on observations to software\n> curious  people of all kinds. A wide range of professional and amateur \n> practitioners will provide you with Software-as-a-Critique-as-a-Service\n> on the spot. Available services range from immediate interface critique, \n> collaborative code inspection, data dowsing, various forms of network\n> analyses, unusability testing, identification of unknown viruses,\n> risk assessment, opening of black-boxes and more.\n> Free software observations provided.\n> Last intake at 16:45.\n> [^]{Invitation to the Walk-In Clinic, June 2017}\n\n% On the following

title The Techno-Galactic Guide to Software Observations?)\n==========================================\n\n> I am less interested in the critical practice of reflection,\n> of showing once-again that the emperor has no clothes, than in\n> finding a way to diffract critical inquiry in order to make\n> difference patterns in a more worldly way.\n> [@haraway:1996:witness]\n% p429, Haraway, modest witness, 1996 from: http://observatory.constantvzw.org/etherdump/friday.md.diff.html\n\n \nA spectre is haunting the galaxy. It is neither revolutionary [@marx:1848:cmanifesto] nor is it a global scale vulnerability [@meltdown:2018:spectre17], but no matter where you happen to be, there is the spectre of a software running somewhere in the background. Look! There it is, looking right back at you. Be it your phone screen or a passing satellite, software's observation and entanglement in the everyday feels complete. \n\nBut is it really? The Techno-Galactic Software Survival Guide is an obsessive fantasy of optimization turned on its head, and stuck to the ceiling of a self-reflecting elevator. It is the ultimate book of dos and don'ts, of forgotten histories and un-inevitable futures, of mindful agile presences and improvisational service architectures, and all that you can and cannot imagine needing in a techno-galaxy. Reading is not enough, software is not just a text, observation is one potential beginning, engagement is tickling.\n\nWith the rediscovery of online services in the 1990s [@haigh:2001:soft60], the use of software has increasingly been knitted into the production of software, even while the rhetoric, rights and procedures continue to suggest that use and production constitute separate realms. This knitting together and its corresponding disavowal has an effect on the way software is used and produced that radically alters its operative role in society. The shifts ripple across galaxies, through social structures, working conditions and personal relations, resulting in a profusion of apparatuses aspiring to be seamless while optimizing and monetizing individual and collective flows of information in line with the interests of a handful of actors. The diffusion of software services affects the personal, in the form of intensified identity shaping and self-management. It also affects the public, as more and more libraries, universities and public infrastructures as well as the management of public life rely on \"solutions\" provided by private companies. Centralizing data flows in the clouds, services blur the last traces of the thin line that separates bio- from necro-politics.\n\n\nGiven how fast software resonates and reproduces, there is a growing urgency to engage with it in manners that goes beyond taking a distance, and that deal with the fact that we are inevitably already entangled. (% CARLINSAYS: repetitive?) How can we interact, respond and think with software? What approaches can we use to recognize the agency of different actors, their ways of working and their politics? What methods of observation are conducive to critical inquiry and affirmative discord? What techniques can we apply to resurface software, finding the sites where their infrastructures are reconfiguring the everyday? How can we remember that software is always at work, especially where it is designed to disappear into the background? \n\nWe pick up the word \"observation\", turning it over and around. (% CARLINSAYS: use past tense?) We are looking forward to a better look , holding all of the stories of people looking at people in mind, holding terminals and keyboards in hand. We sync our breath to the rhythm of our software. We look at this wholistic observation as a way to approach software, as one way to organize engagement with its implications. Observation, and the Enabling of it intensively through data-centric Feedback Mechanisms, is share of the cybernetic spell That underpin s present day software production. Our aim was ??to scrutinize this methodology in its many manifestations, including in \"observatories\" - high cost infrastructures of observation troubled by colonial, imperial, empirical traditions and their problematic divisions of nature and culture. And through scrutiny, what do you think about who gets to watch software (and how) and who is being observed by software (and with what impact)? It is a question of power, one that we answer, at least in part, with critical play. But also with slow pedagogy.\n\nWe pick up the word \"observation\", turning it over and around. We bring it right up to our noses and hold it outstretched to get a better look, holding all of the histories of people looking at other people in mind, holding terminals and keyboards in hand. We sync our breath to the rhythm of our software. We propose holistic observation as a way to approach software, as one way to organize engagement with its implications. Observation, and the enabling of it through intensive data-centric feedback mechanisms, is part of the cybernetic spells that underpin present day software production.\n\nWe respond by cargo cult programming \nwe name the actors, we reject the hierarchies of knowledge, deflect erasures, \nsome call this cargo-culting, we call it method, rejecting their colonial presumption that functionality is the only purpose, and expertise is the only source of knowlede misunderstanding\ncriteria for inclusion\nritual includsion of code with no real purpose, we reject optimization as the only value \nritual of shotgun debugging or deep magic\nWe question the naming of the non functional as unnecessary, we question the description of code as self-explanatory \n\n\nOur aim was to scrutinize this methodology in its many manifestations, including in \"observatories\" -- high cost infrastructures of observation troubled by colonial, imperial, empirical traditions and their problematic divisions of nature and culture. And through scrutiny, we hope to open up a set of questions about who gets to observe software (and how) and who is being observed by software (and with what impact)? It is a question of power, one that we answer, at least in part, with critical play. But also with slow pedagogy.\n\n\n\n\ngold:\n\nTogether we picked up the word \"observation\", turning it over and around. We are here to help you get a better look, holding all of the stories of people looking for people in mind, holding terminals and keyboards in hand. We see how to approach the software, how to organize and engage with its implications. Observation, and the enabling of it through intensive data-centric feedback mechanisms, is part of the cybernetic principles that underpin present day software production.\n\n\nWe are techno-galactic as we meet the contemporary paradigms of computation that proudly announce their capability for \"scaling up to the universe.\" We stand here as modest witnesses to the scales of software communities and related political economies that involve and require observation.\n\nThis guide offers a set of practical and fantastical tools for the tactical (mis)use of software, empowering/enabling users to resist embedded paradigms and assumptions. It is a collection of methods for approaching software, experiencing its myths and realities, its risks and benefits. Drawing on theories of software and computation developed in academia and elsewhere, we grounded our methods in hands-on exercises and experiments that you now can try at home. This Guide to Techno-Galactic Software Observation offers methods developed in and inspired by the context of software production, hacker culture, software studies, computer science research, Free Software communities, privacy activism, and artistic practice. It invites you to experiment with ways to stay with the trouble of software. Come join us at the edge of the universe, on the metro platform, at your kitchen table, as we mark and measure critical distances from and entanglements with the seemingly endless software systems that surround us.\n\nThe techno-galactic software survival guide was collectively produced as an outcome of the Techno-Galactic Software Observatory. \n[This feels like it could be in a different font size or in brackets or is the start of the next page/spread?]\n\n\nRemaining thoughts/notes for inspiration:\nYou may want to just throw all your devices away, but before you do so, wouldn't you want to, for once poke them back?\nYou may think about retreating to a wooden cabin, and live a software-free life, but even then, do you think you could manage without talking about your past software troubles.\nAnd, how about those drawings at the nearby cave, that look eerily similar to an ancient flowchart, you think you can just ignore its poetry?\n\nkostas axelos, planetary interlude, maybe some bits fit with the intro?:\n\n%  We open ourselves to abysses and we are swallowed up in sys-\n%  tems and totalizations - for these are fragments and segments of\n%  \"totality\" which establish themselves as total and/or partial totali-\n%  tarisms - without foreseeing what might be the home, the house, the\n%  habitat of living, thinking man, an unfinished, unfinishable being in a\n%  history which is equally so, neither a shell stuck fast to a rock, nor a\n%  simple nomad or vagabond. Mortals wish for the familiar and for\n%  adventure, the known and the unknown, undecided as to who decides\n%  and to what he decides, chosen rather than choosing. Since they are\n%  unable to be their own master, they allow themselves to be fixed,\n%  tossed about, carried away, scattered and put to flight, incapable of\n%  choosing - if choice there be - between success in and in relation to\n%  the world, and the World. All this does not constitute an error; wan-\n%  dering (errance) commands it. \n Galactic irony is watching us. \n%  Dream of a shadow and dispenser of light, conquistador and\n%  deserter of the World, pawn and pioneer, man sets out to conquer\n%  the stars and he ploughs the sea. The assault he launches against the\n%  astral earth and against the celestial stars is not without disaster.\n Whether he delves into analysis and disintegration -- since he needs\n analyses, concrete and tangible solutions and experimentations -- or\n whether he plunges into syntheses -- since the abstracting power and\n the ungraspable attract him equally --, as precisely and as far as he\n may cast his nets, what his nets catch and what passes through them\n communicate. Never quite awake and never quite beclouded, will we\n learn to live and to see beings and things simultaneously from close\n up and far away, large and small, in their and in our wandering\n (errance), in the great World which is at the same time small, where\n there are no victors - would there be vanquished?\n\n## The Techno-Galactic Software Observatory\n\nIn the summer of 2017, thirty or so people gathered in Brussels to explore practices of proximate critique with and of software in the context of a worksession entitled \"Techno-Galactic Software Observatory\".[^]{Worksessions are intensive transdisciplinary moments, organised twice a year by Constant. They aim to provide conditions for participants with different experiences and capabilities to temporarily link their practice and to  develop ideas, prototypes and  research projects together. For the worksessions, primarily Free, Libre and Open Source software is used and material that is available under Open Content Licenses.} The worksession called for software-curious people of all kinds to ask questions about software. The intuition behind such a call was that developing different types of engagement requires a heterogeneous group of participants with different levels of expertise,  skill and background. During three sessions that were two days each, participants collectively inspected the space-time of computation and probed the universe of hardware-software separations through excursions, exercises and conversations. They tried out various perspectives and methods to look at the larger picture of software as a concept, as a practice, and as a set of techniques.\n\nThe first two days of The Techno-Galactic Software Observatory included visits to the Musée de l'Informatique Pionnière en Belgique [^]{http://www.nam-ip.be} in Namur and the Computermuseum KULeuven[^]{http://www.etwie.be/database/actor/computermuseum-ku-leuven}. Surrounded by these collections of historical ’numerical artefacts’, we started considering software in a long-term context (% CARLINSAYS: Do we mean a long historical context or longue duree or something else?). The museum visits provided an occasion to reflect on the conditions of software's appearance (% CARLINSAYS: appearances?) and to take on current-day questions from a genealogical perspective. What is software? How did it appear as a concept, in what industrial and governmental circumstances? What happens to the material conditions of its production (minerals, factory labor, hardware) when it evaporates into a cloud?\n\nThe second two days were spent focusing on the space-time dimension of IT development. The way computer programs and operating systems are manufactured has changed tremendously over the last , as has its production times and places. From military labs via the mega-corporation cubicles to the open-space freelancer utopia, what ruptures and continuities can be traced in the production, deployment, maintenance and destruction of software? From time-sharing to user-space partitions and containerization, what separations were and are at work? Where and when is software made today?\n\n## The Walk-in Clinic\n\nThe last two days at the Techno-galactic software observatory were dedicated to observation and its consequences. The development of software encompasses a series of practices whose evocative names are increasingly familiar: feedback, report, probe, audit, inspect, scan, diagnose, explore, test ... What are the systems of knowledge and power within which these activities take place, and what other types of observation are possible? As a practical set for our investigations, we set up a walk-in clinic on the 25th floor of the World Trade Center, where users and developers could arrive with software-questions of all kinds.\n\n> Do you suffer from the disappearance of your software into the cloud,\n> feel oppressed by unequal user privilege, or experience the torment of\n> software-ransom of any sort?\n> Bring your devices and interfaces to the World Trade Center!\n> With the help of a clear and in-depth session, at the Techno-Galactic\n> Walk-In Clinic we guarantee immediate results.\n> The  Walk-In Clinic provides free hands-on observations to software\n> curious  people of all kinds. A wide range of professional and amateur \n> practitioners will provide you with Software-as-a-Critique-as-a-Service\n> on the spot. Available services range from immediate interface critique, \n> collaborative code inspection, data dowsing, various forms of network\n> analyses, unusability testing, identification of unknown viruses,\n> risk assessment, opening of black-boxes and more.\n> Free software observations provided.\n> Last intake at 16:45.\n> [^]{Invitation to the Walk-In Clinic, June 2017}\n\n% On the following

TOCITEM: Introduction\n\nA Guide to Techno-Galactic Software Observation (%CARLINSAYS: is this our title or is our title The Techno-Galactic Guide to Software Observations?)\n==========================================\n\n> I am less interested in the critical practice of reflection,\n> of showing once-again that the emperor has no clothes, than in\n> finding a way to diffract critical inquiry in order to make\n> difference patterns in a more worldly way.\n> [@haraway:1996:witness]\n% p429, Haraway, modest witness, 1996 from: http://observatory.constantvzw.org/etherdump/friday.md.diff.html\n\n \nA spectre is haunting the galaxy. It is neither revolutionary [@marx:1848:cmanifesto] nor is it a global scale vulnerability [@meltdown:2018:spectre17], but no matter where you happen to be, there is the spectre of a software running somewhere in the background. Look! There it is, looking right back at you. Be it your phone screen or a passing satellite, software's observation and entanglement in the everyday feels complete. \n\nBut is it really? The Techno-Galactic Software Survival Guide is an obsessive fantasy of optimization turned on its head, and stuck to the ceiling of a self-reflecting elevator. It is the ultimate book of dos and don'ts, of forgotten histories and un-inevitable futures, of mindful agile presences and improvisational service architectures, and all that you can and cannot imagine needing in a techno-galaxy. Reading is not enough, software is not just a text, observation is one potential beginning, engagement is tickling.\n\nWith the rediscovery of online services in the 1990s [@haigh:2001:soft60], the use of software has increasingly been knitted into the production of software, even while the rhetoric, rights and procedures continue to suggest that use and production constitute separate realms. This knitting together and its corresponding disavowal has an effect on the way software is used and produced that radically alters its operative role in society. The shifts ripple across galaxies, through social structures, working conditions and personal relations, resulting in a profusion of apparatuses aspiring to be seamless while optimizing and monetizing individual and collective flows of information in line with the interests of a handful of actors. The diffusion of software services affects the personal, in the form of intensified identity shaping and self-management. It also affects the public, as more and more libraries, universities and public infrastructures as well as the management of public life rely on \"solutions\" provided by private companies. Centralizing data flows in the clouds, services blur the last traces of the thin line that separates bio- from necro-politics.\n\n\nGiven how fast software resonates and reproduces, there is a growing urgency to engage with it in manners that goes beyond taking a distance, and that deal with the fact that we are inevitably already entangled. (% CARLINSAYS: repetitive?) How can we interact, respond and think with software? What approaches can we use to recognize the agency of different actors, their ways of working and their politics? What methods of observation are conducive to critical inquiry and affirmative discord? What techniques can we apply to resurface software, finding the sites where their infrastructures are reconfiguring the everyday? How can we remember that software is always at work, especially where it is designed to disappear into the background? \n\nWe pick up the word \"observation\", turning it over and around. (% CARLINSAYS: use past tense?) We are looking forward to a better look , holding all of the stories of people looking at people in mind, holding terminals and keyboards in hand. We sync our breath to the rhythm of our software. We look at this wholistic observation as a way to approach software, as one way to organize engagement with its implications. Observation, and the Enabling of it intensively through data-centric Feedback Mechanisms, is share of the cybernetic spell That underpin s present day software production. Our aim was ??to scrutinize this methodology in its many manifestations, including in \"observatories\" - high cost infrastructures of observation troubled by colonial, imperial, empirical traditions and their problematic divisions of nature and culture. And through scrutiny, what do you think about who gets to watch software (and how) and who is being observed by software (and with what impact)? It is a question of power, one that we answer, at least in part, with critical play. But also with slow pedagogy.\n\nWe pick up the word \"observation\", turning it over and around. We bring it right up to our noses and hold it outstretched to get a better look, holding all of the histories of people looking at other people in mind, holding terminals and keyboards in hand. We sync our breath to the rhythm of our software. We propose holistic observation as a way to approach software, as one way to organize engagement with its implications. Observation, and the enabling of it through intensive data-centric feedback mechanisms, is part of the cybernetic spells that underpin present day software production.\n\nWe respond by cargo cult programming \nwe name the actors, we reject the hierarchies of knowledge, deflect erasures, \nsome call this cargo-culting, we call it method, rejecting their colonial presumption that functionality is the only purpose, and expertise is the only source of knowlede misunderstanding\ncriteria for inclusion\nritual includsion of code with no real purpose, we reject optimization as the only value \nritual of shotgun debugging or deep magic\nWe question the naming of the non functional as unnecessary, we question the description of code as self-explanatory \n\n\nOur aim was to scrutinize this methodology in its many manifestations, including in \"observatories\" -- high cost infrastructures of observation troubled by colonial, imperial, empirical traditions and their problematic divisions of nature and culture. And through scrutiny, we hope to open up a set of questions about who gets to observe software (and how) and who is being observed by software (and with what impact)? It is a question of power, one that we answer, at least in part, with critical play. But also with slow pedagogy.\n\n\n\n\ngold:\n\nTogether we picked up the word \"observation\", turning it over and around. We are here to help you get a better look, holding all of the stories of people looking for people in mind, holding terminals and keyboards in hand. We see how to approach the software, how to organize and engage with its implications. Observation, and the enabling of it through intensive data-centric feedback mechanisms, is part of the cybernetic principles that underpin present day software production.\n\n\nWe are techno-galactic as we meet the contemporary paradigms of computation that proudly announce their capability for \"scaling up to the universe.\" We stand here as modest witnesses to the scales of software communities and related political economies that involve and require observation.\n\nThis guide offers a set of practical and fantastical tools for the tactical (mis)use of software, empowering/enabling users to resist embedded paradigms and assumptions. It is a collection of methods for approaching software, experiencing its myths and realities, its risks and benefits. Drawing on theories of software and computation developed in academia and elsewhere, we grounded our methods in hands-on exercises and experiments that you now can try at home. This Guide to Techno-Galactic Software Observation offers methods developed in and inspired by the context of software production, hacker culture, software studies, computer science research, Free Software communities, privacy activism, and artistic practice. It invites you to experiment with ways to stay with the trouble of software. Come join us at the edge of the universe, on the metro platform, at your kitchen table, as we mark and measure critical distances from and entanglements with the seemingly endless software systems that surround us.\n\nThe techno-galactic software survival guide was collectively produced as an outcome of the Techno-Galactic Software Observatory. \n[This feels like it could be in a different font size or in brackets or is the start of the next page/spread?]\n\n\nRemaining thoughts/notes for inspiration:\nYou may want to just throw all your devices away, but before you do so, wouldn't you want to, for once poke them back?\nYou may think about retreating to a wooden cabin, and live a software-free life, but even then, do you think you could manage without talking about your past software troubles.\nAnd, how about those drawings at the nearby cave, that look eerily similar to an ancient flowchart, you think you can just ignore its poetry?\n\nkostas axelos, planetary interlude, maybe some bits fit with the intro?:\n\n%  We open ourselves to abysses and we are swallowed up in sys-\n%  tems and totalizations - for these are fragments and segments of\n%  \"totality\" which establish themselves as total and/or partial totali-\n%  tarisms - without foreseeing what might be the home, the house, the\n%  habitat of living, thinking man, an unfinished, unfinishable being in a\n%  history which is equally so, neither a shell stuck fast to a rock, nor a\n%  simple nomad or vagabond. Mortals wish for the familiar and for\n%  adventure, the known and the unknown, undecided as to who decides\n%  and to what he decides, chosen rather than choosing. Since they are\n%  unable to be their own master, they allow themselves to be fixed,\n%  tossed about, carried away, scattered and put to flight, incapable of\n%  choosing - if choice there be - between success in and in relation to\n%  the world, and the World. All this does not constitute an error; wan-\n%  dering (errance) commands it. \n Galactic irony is watching us. \n%  Dream of a shadow and dispenser of light, conquistador and\n%  deserter of the World, pawn and pioneer, man sets out to conquer\n%  the stars and he ploughs the sea. The assault he launches against the\n%  astral earth and against the celestial stars is not without disaster.\n Whether he delves into analysis and disintegration -- since he needs\n analyses, concrete and tangible solutions and experimentations -- or\n whether he plunges into syntheses -- since the abstracting power and\n the ungraspable attract him equally --, as precisely and as far as he\n may cast his nets, what his nets catch and what passes through them\n communicate. Never quite awake and never quite beclouded, will we\n learn to live and to see beings and things simultaneously from close\n up and far away, large and small, in their and in our wandering\n (errance), in the great World which is at the same time small, where\n there are no victors - would there be vanquished?\n\n## The Techno-Galactic Software Observatory\n\nIn the summer of 2017, thirty or so people gathered in Brussels to explore practices of proximate critique with and of software in the context of a worksession entitled \"Techno-Galactic Software Observatory\".[^]{Worksessions are intensive transdisciplinary moments, organised twice a year by Constant. They aim to provide conditions for participants with different experiences and capabilities to temporarily link their practice and to  develop ideas, prototypes and  research projects together. For the worksessions, primarily Free, Libre and Open Source software is used and material that is available under Open Content Licenses.} The worksession called for software-curious people of all kinds to ask questions about software. The intuition behind such a call was that developing different types of engagement requires a heterogeneous group of participants with different levels of expertise,  skill and background. During three sessions that were two days each, participants collectively inspected the space-time of computation and probed the universe of hardware-software separations through excursions, exercises and conversations. They tried out various perspectives and methods to look at the larger picture of software as a concept, as a practice, and as a set of techniques.\n\nThe first two days of The Techno-Galactic Software Observatory included visits to the Musée de l'Informatique Pionnière en Belgique [^]{http://www.nam-ip.be} in Namur and the Computermuseum KULeuven[^]{http://www.etwie.be/database/actor/computermuseum-ku-leuven}. Surrounded by these collections of historical ’numerical artefacts’, we started considering software in a long-term context (% CARLINSAYS: Do we mean a long historical context or longue duree or something else?). The museum visits provided an occasion to reflect on the conditions of software's appearance (% CARLINSAYS: appearances?) and to take on current-day questions from a genealogical perspective. What is software? How did it appear as a concept, in what industrial and governmental circumstances? What happens to the material conditions of its production (minerals, factory labor, hardware) when it evaporates into a cloud?\n\nThe second two days were spent focusing on the space-time dimension of IT development. The way computer programs and operating systems are manufactured has changed tremendously over the last seventy years, as has its production times and places. From military labs to the mega-corporation cubicles to the open-space freelancer utopia, what ruptures and continuities can be traced in the production, deployment, maintenance and destruction of software? From time-sharing to user-space partitions and containerization, what separations were and are at work? Where and when is software made today?\n\n## The Walk-in Clinic (% CARLINSAYS: I think this title should go below the description of the walk-in clinic as the last two days of the observatory worksession and should come instead right\n\nThe last two days at the Techno-galactic software observatory were dedicated to observation and its consequences. The development of software encompasses a series of practices whose evocative names are increasingly familiar: feedback, report, probe, audit, inspect, scan, diagnose, explore, test ... What are the systems of knowledge and power within which these activities take place, and what other types of observation are possible? As a practical set for our investigations, we set up a walk-in clinic on the 25th floor of the World Trade Center, where users and developers could arrive with software-questions of all kinds.\n\n> Do you suffer from the disappearance of your software into the cloud,\n> feel oppressed by unequal user privilege, or experience the torment of\n> software-ransom of any sort?\n> Bring your devices and interfaces to the World Trade Center!\n> With the help of a clear and in-depth session, at the Techno-Galactic\n> Walk-In Clinic we guarantee immediate results.\n> The  Walk-In Clinic provides free hands-on observations to software\n> curious  people of all kinds. A wide range of professional and amateur \n> practitioners will provide you with Software-as-a-Critique-as-a-Service\n> on the spot. Available services range from immediate interface critique, \n> collaborative code inspection, data dowsing, various forms of network\n> analyses, unusability testing, identification of unknown viruses,\n> risk assessment, opening of black-boxes and more.\n> Free software observations provided.\n> Last intake at 16:45.\n> [^]{Invitation to the Walk-In Clinic, June 2017}\n\n% On the following

It is neither revolutionary [@marx:1848:cmanifesto] nor is it a global scale vulnerability [@meltdown:2018:spectre17], but no matter where you happen to be, there is the spectre of a software running somewhere in the background. Look! There it is, looking right back at you. Be it your phone screen or a passing satellite, software's observation and entanglement in the everyday feels complete. \n\nBut is it really? The Techno-Galactic Software Survival Guide is an obsessive fantasy of optimization turned on its head, and stuck to the ceiling of a self-reflecting elevator. It is the ultimate book of dos and don'ts, of forgotten histories and un-inevitable futures, of mindful agile presences and improvisational service architectures, and all that you can and cannot imagine needing in a techno-galaxy. Reading is not enough, software is not just a text, observation is one potential beginning, engagement is tickling.\n\nWith the rediscovery of online services in the 1990s [@haigh:2001:soft60], the use of software has increasingly been knitted into the production of software, even while the rhetoric, rights and procedures continue to suggest that use and production constitute separate realms. This knitting together and its corresponding disavowal has an effect on the way software is used and produced that radically alters its operative role in society. The shifts ripple across galaxies, through social structures, working conditions and personal relations, resulting in a profusion of apparatuses aspiring to be seamless while optimizing and monetizing individual and collective flows of information in line with the interests of a handful of actors. The diffusion of software services affects the personal, in the form of intensified identity shaping and self-management. It also affects the public, as more and more libraries, universities and public infrastructures as well as the management of public life rely on \"solutions\" provided by private companies. Centralizing data flows in the clouds, services blur the last traces of the thin line that separates bio- from necro-politics.\n\n\nGiven how fast software resonates and reproduces, there is a growing urgency to engage with it in manners that goes beyond taking a distance, and that deal with the fact that we are inevitably already entangled. (% CARLINSAYS: repetitive?) How can we interact, respond and think with software? What approaches can we use to recognize the agency of different actors, their ways of working and their politics? What methods of observation are conducive to critical inquiry and affirmative discord? What techniques can we apply to resurface software, finding the sites where their infrastructures are reconfiguring the everyday? How can we remember that software is always at work, especially where it is designed to disappear into the background? \n\nWe pick up the word \"observation\", turning it over and around. (% CARLINSAYS: use past tense?) We are looking forward to a better look , holding all of the stories of people looking at people in mind, holding terminals and keyboards in hand. We sync our breath to the rhythm of our software. We look at this wholistic observation as a way to approach software, as one way to organize engagement with its implications. Observation, and the Enabling of it intensively through data-centric Feedback Mechanisms, is share of the cybernetic spell That underpin s present day software production. Our aim was ??to scrutinize this methodology in its many manifestations, including in \"observatories\" - high cost infrastructures of observation troubled by colonial, imperial, empirical traditions and their problematic divisions of nature and culture. And through scrutiny, what do you think about who gets to watch software (and how) and who is being observed by software (and with what impact)? It is a question of power, one that we answer, at least in part, with critical play. But also with slow pedagogy.\n\nWe pick up the word \"observation\", turning it over and around. We bring it right up to our noses and hold it outstretched to get a better look, holding all of the histories of people looking at other people in mind, holding terminals and keyboards in hand. We sync our breath to the rhythm of our software. We propose holistic observation as a way to approach software, as one way to organize engagement with its implications. Observation, and the enabling of it through intensive data-centric feedback mechanisms, is part of the cybernetic spells that underpin present day software production.\n\nWe respond by cargo cult programming \nwe name the actors, we reject the hierarchies of knowledge, deflect erasures, \nsome call this cargo-culting, we call it method, rejecting their colonial presumption that functionality is the only purpose, and expertise is the only source of knowlede misunderstanding\ncriteria for inclusion\nritual includsion of code with no real purpose, we reject optimization as the only value \nritual of shotgun debugging or deep magic\nWe question the naming of the non functional as unnecessary, we question the description of code as self-explanatory \n\n\nOur aim was to scrutinize this methodology in its many manifestations, including in \"observatories\" -- high cost infrastructures of observation troubled by colonial, imperial, empirical traditions and their problematic divisions of nature and culture. And through scrutiny, we hope to open up a set of questions about who gets to observe software (and how) and who is being observed by software (and with what impact)? It is a question of power, one that we answer, at least in part, with critical play. But also with slow pedagogy.\n\n\n\n\ngold:\n\nTogether we picked up the word \"observation\", turning it over and around. We are here to help you get a better look, holding all of the stories of people looking for people in mind, holding terminals and keyboards in hand. We see how to approach the software, how to organize and engage with its implications. Observation, and the enabling of it through intensive data-centric feedback mechanisms, is part of the cybernetic principles that underpin present day software production.\n\n\nWe are techno-galactic as we meet the contemporary paradigms of computation that proudly announce their capability for \"scaling up to the universe.\" We stand here as modest witnesses to the scales of software communities and related political economies that involve and require observation.\n\nThis guide offers a set of practical and fantastical tools for the tactical (mis)use of software, empowering/enabling users to resist embedded paradigms and assumptions. It is a collection of methods for approaching software, experiencing its myths and realities, its risks and benefits. Drawing on theories of software and computation developed in academia and elsewhere, we grounded our methods in hands-on exercises and experiments that you now can try at home. This Guide to Techno-Galactic Software Observation offers methods developed in and inspired by the context of software production, hacker culture, software studies, computer science research, Free Software communities, privacy activism, and artistic practice. It invites you to experiment with ways to stay with the trouble of software. Come join us at the edge of the universe, on the metro platform, at your kitchen table, as we mark and measure critical distances from and entanglements with the seemingly endless software systems that surround us.\n\nThe techno-galactic software survival guide was collectively produced as an outcome of the Techno-Galactic Software Observatory. \n[This feels like it could be in a different font size or in brackets or is the start of the next page/spread?]\n\n\nRemaining thoughts/notes for inspiration:\nYou may want to just throw all your devices away, but before you do so, wouldn't you want to, for once poke them back?\nYou may think about retreating to a wooden cabin, and live a software-free life, but even then, do you think you could manage without talking about your past software troubles.\nAnd, how about those drawings at the nearby cave, that look eerily similar to an ancient flowchart, you think you can just ignore its poetry?\n\nkostas axelos, planetary interlude, maybe some bits fit with the intro?:\n\n%  We open ourselves to abysses and we are swallowed up in sys-\n%  tems and totalizations - for these are fragments and segments of\n%  \"totality\" which establish themselves as total and/or partial totali-\n%  tarisms - without foreseeing what might be the home, the house, the\n%  habitat of living, thinking man, an unfinished, unfinishable being in a\n%  history which is equally so, neither a shell stuck fast to a rock, nor a\n%  simple nomad or vagabond. Mortals wish for the familiar and for\n%  adventure, the known and the unknown, undecided as to who decides\n%  and to what he decides, chosen rather than choosing. Since they are\n%  unable to be their own master, they allow themselves to be fixed,\n%  tossed about, carried away, scattered and put to flight, incapable of\n%  choosing - if choice there be - between success in and in relation to\n%  the world, and the World. All this does not constitute an error; wan-\n%  dering (errance) commands it. \n Galactic irony is watching us. \n%  Dream of a shadow and dispenser of light, conquistador and\n%  deserter of the World, pawn and pioneer, man sets out to conquer\n%  the stars and he ploughs the sea. The assault he launches against the\n%  astral earth and against the celestial stars is not without disaster.\n Whether he delves into analysis and disintegration -- since he needs\n analyses, concrete and tangible solutions and experimentations -- or\n whether he plunges into syntheses -- since the abstracting power and\n the ungraspable attract him equally --, as precisely and as far as he\n may cast his nets, what his nets catch and what passes through them\n communicate. Never quite awake and never quite beclouded, will we\n learn to live and to see beings and things simultaneously from close\n up and far away, large and small, in their and in our wandering\n (errance), in the great World which is at the same time small, where\n there are no victors - would there be vanquished?\n\n## The Techno-Galactic Software Observatory\n\nIn the summer of 2017, thirty or so people gathered in Brussels to explore practices of proximate critique with and of software in the context of a worksession entitled \"Techno-Galactic Software Observatory\".[^]{Worksessions are intensive transdisciplinary moments, organised twice a year by Constant. They aim to provide conditions for participants with different experiences and capabilities to temporarily link their practice and to  develop ideas, prototypes and  research projects together. For the worksessions, primarily Free, Libre and Open Source software is used and material that is available under Open Content Licenses.} The worksession called for software-curious people of all kinds to ask questions about software. The intuition behind such a call was that developing different types of engagement requires a heterogeneous group of participants with different levels of expertise,  skill and background. During three sessions that were two days each, participants collectively inspected the space-time of computation and probed the universe of hardware-software separations through excursions, exercises and conversations. They tried out various perspectives and methods to look at the larger picture of software as a concept, as a practice, and as a set of techniques.\n\nThe first two days of The Techno-Galactic Software Observatory included visits to the Musée de l'Informatique Pionnière en Belgique [^]{http://www.nam-ip.be} in Namur and the Computermuseum KULeuven[^]{http://www.etwie.be/database/actor/computermuseum-ku-leuven}. Surrounded by these collections of historical ’numerical artefacts’, we started considering software in a long-term context (% CARLINSAYS: Do we mean a long historical context or longue duree or something else?). The museum visits provided an occasion to reflect on the conditions of software's appearance (% CARLINSAYS: appearances?) and to take on current-day questions from a genealogical perspective. What is software? How did it appear as a concept, in what industrial and governmental circumstances? What happens to the material conditions of its production (minerals, factory labor, hardware) when it evaporates into a cloud?\n\nThe second two days were spent focusing on the space-time dimension of IT development. The way computer programs and operating systems are manufactured has changed tremendously over the last seventy years, as has its production times and places. From military labs to the mega-corporation cubicles to the open-space freelancer utopia, what ruptures and continuities can be traced in the production, deployment, maintenance and destruction of software? From time-sharing to user-space partitions and containerization, what separations were and are at work? Where and when is software made today?\n\nThe last two days at the Techno-Galactic Software Observatory were dedicated to observation and its consequences. The development of software encompasses a series of practices whose evocative names are increasingly familiar: feedback, report, probe, audit, inspect, scan, diagnose, explore, test. What are the systems of knowledge and power within which these activities take place, and what other types of observation are possible? As a practical set for our investigations, we set up a walk-in clinic on the 25th floor of the World Trade Center, where users and developers could arrive with software-questions of all kinds.\n\n## The Walk-in Clinic (% CARLINSAYS: I think this title should go below the description of the walk-in clinic as the last two days of the observatory worksession and should come instead right above the invitation to the clinic so I have moved it there)\n\n> Do you suffer from the disappearance of your software into the cloud,\n> feel oppressed by unequal user privilege, or experience the torment of\n> software-ransom of any sort?\n> Bring your devices and interfaces to the World Trade Center!\n> With the help of a clear and in-depth session, at the Techno-Galactic\n> Walk-In Clinic we guarantee immediate results.\n> The  Walk-In Clinic provides free hands-on observations to software\n> curious  people of all kinds.

observation\n==========================================\n\n> I am less interested in the critical practice of reflection, of showing once-again\n> that the emperor has no clothes, than in finding a way to _diffract_ critical inquiry\n> in order to make difference patterns in a more worldly way.\n> [@haraway:1996:witness]\n% p429, Haraway, modest witness, 1996 from: http://observatory.constantvzw.org/etherdump/friday.md.diff.html\n\nThe techno-galactic software survival guide that you are holding right now was collectively produced as an outcome of the Techno-Galactic Software Observatory. This guide proposes several ways to achieve critical distance from the seemingly endless software systems that surround us. It offers practical and fantastical tools for the tactical (mis)use of software, empowering/enabling users to resist embedded paradigms and assumptions. It is a collection of methods for approaching software, experiencing its myths and realities, its risks and benefits.\n\nWith the rise of online services, software use has been increasingly knitted into production, while suggesting that these roles constitute separate realms. This has an effect on the way software is used and produced, and radically alters its operative role in society. The shifts ripple across galaxies, through social structures, working conditions and personal relations, resulting in a profusion of apparatuses aspiring to be seamless while optimizing and monetizing individual and collective flows of information in line with the interests of a handful of actors. The diffusion of software services affects the personal, in the form of intensified identity shaping and self-management. It also affects the public, as more and more libraries, universities and public infrastructures as well as the management of public life rely on \"solutions\" provided by private companies. Centralizing data flows in the clouds, services blur the last traces of the thin line that separates bio- from necro-politics.\n\nGiven how fast these changes resonate and reproduce, there is a growing urgency to engage in a critique of software that goes beyond taking a distance, and that deals with the fact that we are inevitably already entangled. How can we interact, intervene, respond and think with software? What approaches can allow us to recognize the agency of different actors, their ways of functioning and their politics? What methods of observation enable critical inquiry and affirmative discord? What techniques can we apply to resurface software where it has melted into the infrastructure and into the everyday? How can we remember that software is always at work, especially where it is designed to disappear into the background?\n\nWe took on the term of observation for a number of reasons. We regard observation as a way to approach software, as one way to organize engagement with its implications. Observation, and the enabling of observation through intensive data-centric feedback mechanisms, is part of  the cybernetic principles that underpin present day software production. Our aim was to scrutinize this methodology in its many manifestations, including in \"observatories\" -- high cost infrastructures [testing infrastructures?] of observation troubled by colonial, imperial traditions and their problematic divisions of nature and culture -- with the hope of opening up questions about who gets to observe software (and how) and who is being observed by software (and with what impact)?

This guide proposes several ways to achieve critical distance from the seemingly endless software systems that surround us. It offers practical and fantastical tools for the tactical (mis)use of software, empowering/enabling users to resist embedded paradigms and assumptions. It is a collection of methods for approaching software, experiencing its myths and realities, its risks and benefits.\n\nWith the rise of online services, the use of software has increasingly been knitted into the production of software, even while the rhetoric, rights, and procedures continue to suggest that use and production constitute separate realms. This knitting together and its corresponding disavowal have an effect on the way software is used and produced, and radically alters its operative role in society. The shifts ripple across galaxies, through social structures, working conditions and personal relations, resulting in a profusion of apparatuses aspiring to be seamless while optimizing and monetizing individual and collective flows of information in line with the interests of a handful of actors. The diffusion of software services affects the personal, in the form of intensified identity shaping and self-management. It also affects the public, as more and more libraries, universities and public infrastructures as well as the management of public life rely on \"solutions\" provided by private companies. Centralizing data flows in the clouds, services blur the last traces of the thin line that separates bio- from necro-politics.\n\nGiven how fast these changes resonate and reproduce, there is a growing urgency to engage in a critique of software that goes beyond taking a distance, and that deals with the fact that we are inevitably already entangled. How can we interact, intervene, respond and think with software? What approaches can allow us to recognize the agency of different actors, their ways of functioning and their politics? What methods of observation enable critical inquiry and affirmative discord? What techniques can we apply to resurface software where it has melted into the infrastructure and into the everyday? How can we remember that software is always at work, especially where it is designed to disappear into the background?\n\nWe adopted the term of observation for a number of reasons. We regard observation as a way to approach software, as one way to organize engagement with its implications. Observation, and the enabling of observation through intensive data-centric feedback mechanisms, is part of  the cybernetic principles that underpin present day software production. Our aim was to scrutinize this methodology in its many manifestations, including in \"observatories\" -- high cost infrastructures [testing infrastructures?] of observation troubled by colonial, imperial traditions and their problematic divisions of nature and culture -- with the hope of opening up questions about who gets to observe software (and how) and who is being observed by software (and with what impact)? It is a question of power, one that we answer, at least in part, with critical play.\n\nWe adopted the term techno-galactic to match the advertised capability of \"scaling up to the universe\" that comes in contemporary paradigms of computation, and to address different scales of software communities and related political economies that involve and require observation.\n\nDrawing on theories of software and computation developed in academia and elsewhere, we grounded our methods in hands-on exercises and experiments that you now can try at home.

They aim to provide conditions for participants with different experiences and capabilities to temporarily link their practice and to  develop ideas, prototypes and  research projects together. For the worksessions, primarily Free, Libre and Open Source software is used and material that is available under ???} The worksession called for software-curious people of all kinds to ask questions about software. The intuition behind such a call was that different types of engagement requires a heterogeneous group of participants with different levels of expertise,  skill and background. During three sessions of two days, participants collectively inspected the space-time of computation and probed the universe of hardware-software separations through excursions, exercises and conversations. They tried out various perspectives and methods to look at the larger picture of software as a concept, as a practice, and as a set of techniques.\n\nThe first two days of The Techno-Galactic Software Observatory included visits to the Musée de l'Informatique Pionnière en Belgique [^]{http://www.nam-ip.be} in Namur and the Computermuseum KULeuven[^]{http://www.etwie.be/database/actor/computermuseum-ku-leuven}. In the surroundings of these collections of historical ’numerical artefacts’, we started viewing software in a long-term context. It offered us the occasion to reflect on the conditions of its appearance, and allowed us to take on current-day questions from a genealogical perspective. What is software? How did it appear as a concept, in what industrial and governmental circumstances? What happens to the material conditions of its production (minerals, factory labor, hardware) when it evaporates into a cloud?\n\nThe second two days we focused on the space-time dimension of IT development. The way computer programs and operating systems are manufactured changed tremendously through time, and so did its production times and places. From military labs via the mega-corporation cubicles to the open-space freelancer utopia, what ruptures and continuities can be traced in the production, deployment, maintenance and destruction of software? From time-sharing to user-space partitions and containerization, what separations were and are at work? Where and when is software made today?\n\n## The Walk-in Clinic\n\nThe last two days at the Techno-galactic software observatory were dedicated to observation and its consequences. The development of software encompasses a series of practices whose evocative names are increasingly familiar: feedback, report, probe, audit, inspect, scan, diagnose, explore, test ... What are the systems of knowledge and power within which these activities take place, and what other types of observation are possible? As a practical set for our investigations, we set up a walk-in clinic on the 25th floor of the World Trade Center, where users and developers could arrive with software-questions of all kinds.\n\n% ![Documenting the path of a Software Curious Person going through the Walk-in Clinic]( http://gallery.constantvzw.org/index.php/Techno-Galactic-Software-Observatory/IMAG1399 )\n\n> Do you suffer from the disappearance of your software into the cloud,\n> feel oppressed by unequal user privilege, or experience the torment of\n> software-ransom of any sort?\n> Bring your devices and interfaces to the World Trade Center!\n> With the help of a clear and in-depth session, at the Techno-Galactic\n> Walk-In Clinic we guarantee immediate results.\n> The  Walk-In Clinic provides free hands-on observations to software\n> curious  people of all kinds.

It is neither revolutionary [@marx:1848:cmanifesto] nor is it a global scale vulnerability [@meltdown:2018:spectre17], but no matter where you happen to be, there is the spectre of a software running somewhere in the background. Look! There it is, looking right back at you. Be it your phone screen or a passing satellite, software's observation and entanglement in the everyday feels complete. \n\nBut is it really? The Techno-Galactic Software Survival Guide is an obsessive fantasy of optimization turned on its head, and stuck to the ceiling of a self-reflecting elevator. It is the ultimate book of dos and don'ts, of forgotten histories and un-inevitable futures, of mindful agile presences and improvisational service architectures, and all that you can and cannot imagine needing in a techno-galaxy. Reading is not enough, software is not just a text, observation is one potential beginning, engagement is tickling.\n\nWith the rediscovery of online services in the 1990s [@haigh:2001:soft60], the use of software has increasingly been knitted into the production of software, even while the rhetoric, rights and procedures continue to suggest that use and production constitute separate realms.

Mortals wish for the familiar and for\n%  adventure, the known and the unknown, undecided as to who decides\n%  and to what he decides, chosen rather than choosing. Since they are\n%  unable to be their own master, they allow themselves to be fixed,\n%  tossed about, carried away, scattered and put to flight, incapable of\n%  choosing - if choice there be - between success in and in relation to\n%  the world, and the World. All this does not constitute an error; wan-\n%  dering (errance) commands it. \n Galactic irony is watching us. \n%  Dream of a shadow and dispenser of light, conquistador and\n%  deserter of the World, pawn and pioneer, man sets out to conquer\n%  the stars and he ploughs the sea. The assault he launches against the\n%  astral earth and against the celestial stars is not without disaster.\n Whether he delves into analysis and disintegration -- since he needs\n analyses, concrete and tangible solutions and experimentations -- or\n whether he plunges into syntheses -- since the abstracting power and\n the ungraspable attract him equally --, as precisely and as far as he\n may cast his nets, what his nets catch and what passes through them\n communicate. Never quite awake and never quite beclouded, will we\n learn to live and to see beings and things simultaneously from close\n up and far away, large and small, in their and in our wandering\n (errance), in the great World which is at the same time small, where\n there are no victors - would there be vanquished?\n\n## The Techno-Galactic Software Observatory\n\nIn the summer of 2017, thirty or so people gathered in Brussels to explore practices of proximate critique with and of software in the context of a worksession entitled \"Techno-Galactic Software Observatory\".[^]{Worksessions are intensive transdisciplinary moments, organised twice a year by Constant.

Software Observation?\n\n> I am less interested in the critical practice of reflection,\n> of showing once-again that the emperor has no clothes, than in\n> finding a way to diffract critical inquiry

http://observatory.constantvzw.org/etherdump/friday.md.diff.html\n\n \nA spectre is haunting the galaxy. It is neither revolutionary [@marx:1848:cmanifesto] nor is it a global scale vulnerability [@meltdown:2018:spectre17], but no matter where you happen to be, there is the spectre of a software running somewhere in the background. Look! There it is, looking right back at you. Be it your phone screen or a passing satellite, software's observation and entanglement in the everyday feels complete. \n\nBut is it really? The Techno-Galactic Software Survival Guide is an obsessive fantasy of optimization turned on its head, and stuck to the ceiling of a self-reflecting elevator. It is the ultimate book of dos and don'ts, of forgotten histories and un-inevitable futures, of mindful agile presences and improvisational service architectures, and all that you can and cannot imagine needing in a techno-galaxy. Reading is not enough, software is not just a text, observation is one potential beginning, engagement is tickling.\n\nWith the rediscovery of online services in the 1990s [@haigh:2001:soft60], the use of software has increasingly been knitted into the production of software, even while the rhetoric, rights and procedures continue to suggest that use and production constitute separate realms. This knitting together and its corresponding disavowal has an effect on the way software is used and produced that radically alters its operative role in society. The shifts ripple across galaxies, through social structures, working conditions and personal relations, resulting in a profusion of apparatuses aspiring to be seamless while optimizing and monetizing individual and collective flows of information in line with the interests of a handful of actors. The diffusion of software services affects the personal, in the form of intensified identity shaping and self-management. It also affects the public, as more and more libraries, universities and public infrastructures as well as the management of public life rely on \"solutions\" provided by private companies. Centralizing data flows in the clouds, services blur the last traces of the thin line that separates bio- from necro-politics.\n\n\nGiven how fast software resonates and reproduces, there is a growing urgency to engage with it in manners that goes beyond taking a distance, and that deal with the fact that we are inevitably already entangled. (% CARLINSAYS: repetitive?) How can we interact, respond and think with software? What approaches can we use to recognize the agency of different actors, their ways of working and their politics? What methods of observation are conducive to critical inquiry and affirmative discord? What techniques can we apply to resurface software, finding the sites where their infrastructures are reconfiguring the everyday? How can we remember that software is always at work, especially where it is designed to disappear into the background? \n\nWe pick up the word \"observation\", turning it over and around. (% CARLINSAYS: use past tense?) We are looking forward to a better look , holding all of the stories of people looking at people in mind, holding terminals and keyboards in hand. We sync our breath to the rhythm of our software. We look at this wholistic observation as a way to approach software, as one way to organize engagement with its implications. Observation, and the Enabling of it intensively through data-centric Feedback Mechanisms, is share of the cybernetic spell That underpins present day software production. Our aim was ??to scrutinize this methodology in its many manifestations, including in \"observatories\" - high cost infrastructures of observation troubled by colonial, imperial, empirical traditions and their problematic divisions of nature and culture. And through scrutiny, what do you think about who gets to watch software (and how) and who is being observed by software (and with what impact)? It is a question of power, one that we answer, at least in part, with critical play. But also with slow pedagogy.\n\nWe pick up the word \"observation\", turning it over and around. We bring it right up to our noses and hold it outstretched to get a better look, holding all of the histories of people looking at other people in mind, holding terminals and keyboards in hand. We sync our breath to the rhythm of our software. We propose holistic observation as a way to approach software, as one way to organize engagement with its implications. Observation, and the enabling of it through intensive data-centric feedback mechanisms, is part of the cybernetic spells that underpin present day software production.\n\nWe respond by cargo cult programming \nwe name the actors, we reject the hierarchies of knowledge, deflect erasures, \nsome call this cargo-culting, we call it method, rejecting their colonial presumption that functionality is the only purpose, and expertise is the only source of knowlede misunderstanding\ncriteria for inclusion\nritual includsion of code with no real purpose, we reject optimization as the only value \nritual of shotgun debugging or deep magic\nWe question the naming of the non functional as unnecessary, we question the description of code as self-explanatory \n\n\nOur aim was to scrutinize this methodology in its many manifestations, including in \"observatories\" -- high cost infrastructures of observation troubled by colonial, imperial, empirical traditions and their problematic divisions of nature and culture. And through scrutiny, we hope to open up a set of questions about who gets to observe software (and how) and who is being observed by software (and with what impact)? It is a question of power, one that we answer, at least in part, with critical play. But also with slow pedagogy.\n\n\n\n\ngold:\n\nTogether we picked up the word \"observation\", turning it over and around. We are here to help you get a better look, holding all of the stories of people looking for people in mind, holding terminals and keyboards in hand. We see how to approach the software, how to organize and engage with its implications. Observation, and the enabling of it through intensive data-centric feedback mechanisms, is part of the cybernetic principles that underpin present day software production.\n\n\nWe are techno-galactic as we meet the contemporary paradigms of computation that proudly announce their capability for \"scaling up to the universe.\" We stand here as modest witnesses to the scales of software communities and related political economies that involve and require observation.\n\nThis guide offers a set of practical and fantastical tools for the tactical (mis)use of software, empowering/enabling users to resist embedded paradigms and assumptions. It is a collection of methods for approaching software, experiencing its myths and realities, its risks and benefits. Drawing on theories of software and computation developed in academia and elsewhere, we grounded our methods in hands-on exercises and experiments that you now can try at home. This Guide to Techno-Galactic Software Observation offers methods developed in and inspired by the context of software production, hacker culture, software studies, computer science research, Free Software communities, privacy activism, and artistic practice. It invites you to experiment with ways to stay with the trouble of software. Come join us at the edge of the universe, on the metro platform, at your kitchen table, as we mark and measure critical distances from and entanglements with the seemingly endless software systems that surround us.\n\nThe techno-galactic software survival guide was collectively produced as an outcome of the Techno-Galactic Software Observatory. \n[This feels like it could be in a different font size or in brackets or is the start of the next page/spread?]\n\n\nRemaining thoughts/notes for inspiration:\nYou may want to just throw all your devices away, but before you do so, wouldn't you want to, for once poke them back?\nYou may think about retreating to a wooden cabin, and live a software-free life, but even then, do you think you could manage without talking about your past software troubles.\nAnd, how about those drawings at the nearby cave, that look eerily similar to an ancient flowchart, you think you can just ignore its poetry?\n\nkostas axelos, planetary interlude, maybe some bits fit with the intro?:\n\n%  We open ourselves to abysses and we are swallowed up in sys-\n%  tems and totalizations - for these are fragments and segments of\n%  \"totality\" which establish themselves as total and/or partial totali-\n%  tarisms - without foreseeing what might be the home, the house, the\n%  habitat of living, thinking man, an unfinished, unfinishable being in a\n%  history which is equally so, neither a shell stuck fast to a rock, nor a\n%  simple nomad or vagabond. Mortals wish for the familiar and for\n%  adventure, the known and the unknown, undecided as to who decides\n%  and to what he decides, chosen rather than choosing. Since they are\n%  unable to be their own master, they allow themselves to be fixed,\n%  tossed about, carried away, scattered and put to flight, incapable of\n%  choosing - if choice there be - between success in and in relation to\n%  the world, and the World. All this does not constitute an error; wan-\n%  dering (errance) commands it. \n Galactic irony is watching us. \n%  Dream of a shadow and dispenser of light, conquistador and\n%  deserter of the World, pawn and pioneer, man sets out to conquer\n%  the stars and he ploughs the sea. The assault he launches against the\n%  astral earth and against the celestial stars is not without disaster.\n Whether he delves into analysis and disintegration -- since he needs\n analyses, concrete and tangible solutions and experimentations -- or\n whether he plunges into syntheses -- since the abstracting power and\n the ungraspable attract him equally --, as precisely and as far as he\n may cast his nets, what his nets catch and what passes through them\n communicate. Never quite awake and never quite beclouded, will we\n learn to live and to see beings and things simultaneously from close\n up and far away, large and small, in their and in our wandering\n (errance), in the great World which is at the same time small, where\n there are no victors - would there be vanquished?\n\n## The Techno-Galactic Software Observatory\n\nIn the summer of 2017, thirty or so people gathered in Brussels to explore practices of proximate critique with and of software in the context of a worksession entitled \"Techno-Galactic Software Observatory\".[^]{Worksessions are intensive transdisciplinary moments, organised twice a year by Constant. They aim to provide conditions for participants with different experiences and capabilities to temporarily link their practice and to  develop ideas, prototypes and  research projects together. For the worksessions, primarily Free, Libre and Open Source software is used and material that is available under Open Content Licenses.} The worksession called for software-curious people of all kinds to ask questions about software. The intuition behind such a call was that developing different types of engagement requires a heterogeneous group of participants with different levels of expertise,  skill and background. During three sessions that were two days each, participants collectively inspected the space-time of computation and probed the universe of hardware-software separations through excursions, exercises and conversations. They tried out various perspectives and methods to look at the larger picture of software as a concept, as a practice, and as a set of techniques.\n\nThe first two days of The Techno-Galactic Software Observatory included visits to the Musée de l'Informatique Pionnière en Belgique [^]{http://www.nam-ip.be} in Namur and the Computermuseum KULeuven[^]{http://etwie.be/database/actor/computermuseum-ku-leuven}. Surrounded by these collections of historical ’numerical artefacts’, we started considering software in a long-term context (% CARLINSAYS: Do we mean a long historical context or longue duree or something else?). The museum visits provided an occasion to reflect on the conditions of software's appearance (% CARLINSAYS: appearances?) and to take on current-day questions from a genealogical perspective. What is software? How did it appear as a concept, in what industrial and governmental circumstances? What happens to the material conditions of its production (minerals, factory labor, hardware) when it evaporates into a cloud?\n\nThe second two days were spent focusing on the space-time dimension of IT development. The way computer programs and operating systems are manufactured has changed tremendously over the last seventy years, as has its production times and places. From military labs to the mega-corporation cubicles to the open-space freelancer utopia, what ruptures and continuities can be traced in the production, deployment, maintenance and destruction of software? From time-sharing to user-space partitions and containerization, what separations were and are at work? Where and when is software made today?\n\nThe last two days at the Techno-Galactic Software Observatory were dedicated to observation and its consequences. The development of software encompasses a series of practices whose evocative names are increasingly familiar: feedback, report, probe, audit, inspect, scan, diagnose, explore, test. What are the systems of knowledge and power within which these activities take place, and what other types of observation are possible? As a practical set for our investigations, we set up a walk-in clinic on the 25th floor of the World Trade Center, where users and developers could arrive with software-questions of all kinds.\n\n## The Walk-in Clinic (% CARLINSAYS: I think this title should go below the description of the walk-in clinic as the last two days of the observatory worksession and should come instead right above the invitation to the clinic so I have moved it there)\n\n> Do you suffer from the disappearance of your software into the cloud,\n> feel oppressed by unequal user privilege, or experience the torment of\n> software-ransom of any sort?\n> Bring your devices and interfaces to the World Trade Center!\n> With the help of a clear and in-depth session, at the Techno-Galactic\n> Walk-In Clinic we guarantee immediate results.\n> The  Walk-In Clinic provides free hands-on observations to software\n> curious  people of all kinds.

It is neither revolutionary [@marx:1848:cmanifesto] nor is it a global scale vulnerability [@meltdown:2018:spectre17], but no matter where you happen to be, there is the spectre of a software running somewhere in the background. Look! There it is, looking right back at you. Be it your phone screen or a passing satellite, software's observation and entanglement in the everyday appears complete. \n\nBut is it so total? The Techno-Galactic Software Survival Guide is an obsessive fantasy of optimization turned on its head, and stuck to the ceiling of a self-reflecting elevator. It is the ultimate book of dos and don'ts, of forgotten histories and un-inevitable futures, of mindful agile actions and improvisational service architectures, of any and all things that you can and cannot imagine needing in a techno-galaxy. Reading is not enough, software is not just a text, observation is one potential beginning, engagement is tickling.\n\n(%CARLINSAYS: This felt like it needed a transition)\nHere is one possible first point of contact. With the rediscovery of online services in the 1990s [@haigh:2001:soft60], the use of software has increasingly been knitted into the production of software, even while the rhetoric, rights and procedures continue to suggest that use and production constitute separate realms. This knitting together and its corresponding disavowal has an effect on the way software is used and produced that radically alters its operative role in society. The shifts ripple across galaxies, through social structures, working conditions and personal relations, resulting in a profusion of apparatuses aspiring to be seamless while optimizing and monetizing individual and collective flows of information in line with the interests of a handful of actors. The diffusion of software services affects the personal, in the form of intensified identity shaping and self-management. It also affects the public, as more and more libraries, universities and public infrastructures as well as the management of public life rely on \"solutions\" provided by private companies. Centralizing data flows in the clouds, services blur the last traces of the thin line that separates bio- from necro-politics.\n\n\nGiven how fast software resonates and reproduces, there is a growing urgency to engage with it in manners that goes beyond taking a distance, and that deal with the fact that we are inevitably already entangled. (% CARLINSAYS: repetitive?) How can we interact, respond and think with software? What approaches can we use to recognize the agency of different actors, their ways of working and their politics? What methods of observation are conducive to critical inquiry and affirmative discord? What techniques can we apply to resurface software, finding the sites where their infrastructures are reconfiguring the everyday? How can we remember that software is always at work, especially where it is designed to disappear into the background? \n\nWe pick up the word \"observation\", turning it over and around. (% CARLINSAYS: use past tense?) We are looking forward to a better look , holding all of the stories of people looking at people in mind, holding terminals and keyboards in hand. We sync our breath to the rhythm of our software. We look at this wholistic observation as a way to approach software, as one way to organize engagement with its implications. Observation, and the Enabling of it intensively through data-centric Feedback Mechanisms, is share of the cybernetic spell That underpins present day software production. Our aim was ??to scrutinize this methodology in its many manifestations, including in \"observatories\" - high cost infrastructures of observation troubled by colonial, imperial, empirical traditions and their problematic divisions of nature and culture. And through scrutiny, what do you think about who gets to watch software (and how) and who is being observed by software (and with what impact)? It is a question of power, one that we answer, at least in part, with critical play. But also with slow pedagogy.\n\nWe pick up the word \"observation\", turning it over and around. We bring it right up to our noses and hold it outstretched to get a better look, holding all of the histories of people looking at other people in mind, holding terminals and keyboards in hand. We sync our breath to the rhythm of our software. We propose holistic observation as a way to approach software, as one way to organize engagement with its implications. Observation, and the enabling of it through intensive data-centric feedback mechanisms, is part of the cybernetic spells that underpin present day software production.\n\nWe respond by cargo cult programming \nwe name the actors, we reject the hierarchies of knowledge, deflect erasures, \nsome call this cargo-culting, we call it method, rejecting their colonial presumption that functionality is the only purpose, and expertise is the only source of knowlede misunderstanding\ncriteria for inclusion\nritual includsion of code with no real purpose, we reject optimization as the only value \nritual of shotgun debugging or deep magic\nWe question the naming of the non functional as unnecessary, we question the description of code as self-explanatory \n\n\nOur aim was to scrutinize this methodology in its many manifestations, including in \"observatories\" -- high cost infrastructures of observation troubled by colonial, imperial, empirical traditions and their problematic divisions of nature and culture. And through scrutiny, we hope to open up a set of questions about who gets to observe software (and how) and who is being observed by software (and with what impact)? It is a question of power, one that we answer, at least in part, with critical play. But also with slow pedagogy.\n\n\n\n\ngold:\n\nTogether we picked up the word \"observation\", turning it over and around. We are here to help you get a better look, holding all of the stories of people looking for people in mind, holding terminals and keyboards in hand. We see how to approach the software, how to organize and engage with its implications. Observation, and the enabling of it through intensive data-centric feedback mechanisms, is part of the cybernetic principles that underpin present day software production.\n\n\nWe are techno-galactic as we meet the contemporary paradigms of computation that proudly announce their capability for \"scaling up to the universe.\" We stand here as modest witnesses to the scales of software communities and related political economies that involve and require observation.\n\nThis guide offers a set of practical and fantastical tools for the tactical (mis)use of software, empowering/enabling users to resist embedded paradigms and assumptions. It is a collection of methods for approaching software, experiencing its myths and realities, its risks and benefits. Drawing on theories of software and computation developed in academia and elsewhere, we grounded our methods in hands-on exercises and experiments that you now can try at home. This Guide to Techno-Galactic Software Observation offers methods developed in and inspired by the context of software production, hacker culture, software studies, computer science research, Free Software communities, privacy activism, and artistic practice. It invites you to experiment with ways to stay with the trouble of software. Come join us at the edge of the universe, on the metro platform, at your kitchen table, as we mark and measure critical distances from and entanglements with the seemingly endless software systems that surround us.\n\nThe techno-galactic software survival guide was collectively produced as an outcome of the Techno-Galactic Software Observatory. \n[This feels like it could be in a different font size or in brackets or is the start of the next page/spread?]\n\n\nRemaining thoughts/notes for inspiration:\nYou may want to just throw all your devices away, but before you do so, wouldn't you want to, for once poke them back?\nYou may think about retreating to a wooden cabin, and live a software-free life, but even then, do you think you could manage without talking about your past software troubles.\nAnd, how about those drawings at the nearby cave, that look eerily similar to an ancient flowchart, you think you can just ignore its poetry?\n\nkostas axelos, planetary interlude, maybe some bits fit with the intro?:\n\n%  We open ourselves to abysses and we are swallowed up in sys-\n%  tems and totalizations - for these are fragments and segments of\n%  \"totality\" which establish themselves as total and/or partial totali-\n%  tarisms - without foreseeing what might be the home, the house, the\n%  habitat of living, thinking man, an unfinished, unfinishable being in a\n%  history which is equally so, neither a shell stuck fast to a rock, nor a\n%  simple nomad or vagabond. Mortals wish for the familiar and for\n%  adventure, the known and the unknown, undecided as to who decides\n%  and to what he decides, chosen rather than choosing. Since they are\n%  unable to be their own master, they allow themselves to be fixed,\n%  tossed about, carried away, scattered and put to flight, incapable of\n%  choosing - if choice there be - between success in and in relation to\n%  the world, and the World. All this does not constitute an error; wan-\n%  dering (errance) commands it. \n Galactic irony is watching us. \n%  Dream of a shadow and dispenser of light, conquistador and\n%  deserter of the World, pawn and pioneer, man sets out to conquer\n%  the stars and he ploughs the sea. The assault he launches against the\n%  astral earth and against the celestial stars is not without disaster.\n Whether he delves into analysis and disintegration -- since he needs\n analyses, concrete and tangible solutions and experimentations -- or\n whether he plunges into syntheses -- since the abstracting power and\n the ungraspable attract him equally --, as precisely and as far as he\n may cast his nets, what his nets catch and what passes through them\n communicate. Never quite awake and never quite beclouded, will we\n learn to live and to see beings and things simultaneously from close\n up and far away, large and small, in their and in our wandering\n (errance), in the great World which is at the same time small, where\n there are no victors - would there be vanquished?\n\n## The Techno-Galactic Software Observatory\n\nIn the summer of 2017, thirty or so people gathered in Brussels to explore practices of proximate critique with and of software in the context of a worksession entitled \"Techno-Galactic Software Observatory\".[^]{Worksessions are intensive transdisciplinary moments, organised twice a year by Constant. They aim to provide conditions for participants with different experiences and capabilities to temporarily link their practice and to  develop ideas, prototypes and  research projects together. For the worksessions, primarily Free, Libre and Open Source software is used and material that is available under Open Content Licenses.} The worksession called for software-curious people of all kinds to ask questions about software. The intuition behind such a call was that developing different types of engagement requires a heterogeneous group of participants with different levels of expertise,  skill and background. During three sessions that were two days each, participants collectively inspected the space-time of computation and probed the universe of hardware-software separations through excursions, exercises and conversations. They tried out various perspectives and methods to look at the larger picture of software as a concept, as a practice, and as a set of techniques.\n\nThe first two days of The Techno-Galactic Software Observatory included visits to the Musée de l'Informatique Pionnière en Belgique [^]{http://www.nam-ip.be} in Namur and the Computermuseum KULeuven[^]{http://etwie.be/database/actor/computermuseum-ku-leuven}. Surrounded by these collections of historical ’numerical artefacts’, we started considering software in a long-term context (% CARLINSAYS: Do we mean a long historical context or longue duree or something else?). The museum visits provided an occasion to reflect on the conditions of software's appearance (% CARLINSAYS: appearances?) and to take on current-day questions from a genealogical perspective. What is software? How did it appear as a concept, in what industrial and governmental circumstances? What happens to the material conditions of its production (minerals, factory labor, hardware) when it evaporates into a cloud?\n\nThe second two days were spent focusing on the space-time dimension of IT development. The way computer programs and operating systems are manufactured has changed tremendously over the last seventy years, as has its production times and places. From military labs to the mega-corporation cubicles to the open-space freelancer utopia, what ruptures and continuities can be traced in the production, deployment, maintenance and destruction of software? From time-sharing to user-space partitions and containerization, what separations were and are at work? Where and when is software made today?\n\nThe last two days at the Techno-Galactic Software Observatory were dedicated to observation and its consequences. The development of software encompasses a series of practices whose evocative names are increasingly familiar: feedback, report, probe, audit, inspect, scan, diagnose, explore, test. What are the systems of knowledge and power within which these activities take place, and what other types of observation are possible? As a practical set for our investigations, we set up a walk-in clinic on the 25th floor of the World Trade Center, where users and developers could arrive with software-questions of all kinds.\n\n## The Walk-in Clinic (% CARLINSAYS: I think this title should go below the description of the walk-in clinic as the last two days of the observatory worksession and should come instead right above the invitation to the clinic so I have moved it there)\n\n> Do you suffer from the disappearance of your software into the cloud,\n> feel oppressed by unequal user privilege, or experience the torment of\n> software-ransom of any sort?\n> Bring your devices and interfaces to the World Trade Center!\n> With the help of a clear and in-depth session, at the Techno-Galactic\n> Walk-In Clinic we guarantee immediate results.\n> The  Walk-In Clinic provides free hands-on observations to software\n> curious  people of all kinds.

It also seems important to make sure that the two page list of services poster for the clinic is printed on pages that are facing each other. If they are already set to do that then maybe nix my suggestion of moving the intake form up, but if they are not then that would be one way to shift the pages to make that

Guide to Techno-Galactic Software Observation\" or \"The Techno-Galactic Guide to Software Observation\" or something else?)\n\n> I am less interested in the critical practice of reflection,\n> of showing once-again that the emperor has no clothes, than in\n> finding a way to diffract critical inquiry in order to make\n> difference patterns in a more worldly way.\n> [@haraway:1996:witness]\n% p429, Haraway, modest witness, 1996 from: http://observatory.constantvzw.org/etherdump/friday.md.diff.html\n\n \nA spectre is haunting the galaxy. It is neither revolutionary [@marx:1848:cmanifesto] nor is it a global scale vulnerability [@meltdown:2018:spectre17], but no matter where you happen to be, there is the spectre of a software running somewhere in the background. Look! There it is, looking right back at you. Be it your phone screen or a passing satellite, software's observation and entanglement in the everyday appears complete. \n\nBut is it so total? The Techno-Galactic Software Survival Guide is an obsessive fantasy of optimization turned on its head, and stuck to the ceiling of a self-reflecting elevator. It is the ultimate book of dos and don'ts, of forgotten histories and un-inevitable futures, of mindful agile actions and improvisational service architectures, of any and all things that you can and cannot imagine needing in a techno-galaxy. Reading is not enough, software is not just a text, observation is one potential beginning, engagement is tickling.\n\n(%CARLINSAYS: This felt like it needed a transition in order to not leave tickling hanging and to have a logic for why this )\nHere is one possible first point of contact. A1960s dream of online services was revived in the 1990s [@haigh:2001:soft60]. Since then the use of software has increasingly been knitted into the production of software, even while the rhetoric, rights and procedures continue to suggest that use and production constitute separate realms. This knitting together and its corresponding disavowal has an effect on the way software is used and produced that radically alters its operative role in society. The shifts ripple across galaxies, through social structures, working conditions and personal relations, resulting in a profusion of apparatuses aspiring to be seamless while optimizing and monetizing individual and collective flows of information in line with the interests of a handful of actors. The diffusion of software services affects the personal, in the form of intensified identity shaping and self-management. It also affects the public, as more and more libraries, universities and public infrastructures as well as the management of public life rely on \"solutions\" provided by private companies. Centralizing data flows in the clouds, services blur the last traces of the thin line that separates bio- from necro-politics.\n\n\nGiven how fast software resonates and reproduces, there is a growing urgency to engage with it in manners that goes beyond taking a distance, and that deal with the fact that we are inevitably already entangled. (% CARLINSAYS: repetitive?) How can we interact, respond and think with software? What approaches can we use to recognize the agency of different actors, their ways of working and their politics? What methods of observation are conducive to critical inquiry and affirmative discord? What techniques can we apply to resurface software, finding the sites where their infrastructures are reconfiguring the everyday? How can we remember that software is always at work, especially where it is designed to disappear into the background? \n\nWe pick up the word \"observation\", turning it over and around. (% CARLINSAYS: use past tense?) We are looking forward to a better look , holding all of the stories of people looking at people in mind, holding terminals and keyboards in hand. We sync our breath to the rhythm of our software. We look at this wholistic observation as a way to approach software, as one way to organize engagement with its implications. Observation, and the Enabling of it intensively through data-centric Feedback Mechanisms, is share of the cybernetic spell That underpins present day software production. Our aim was ??to scrutinize this methodology in its many manifestations, including in \"observatories\" - high cost infrastructures of observation troubled by colonial, imperial, empirical traditions and their problematic divisions of nature and culture. And through scrutiny, what do you think about who gets to watch software (and how) and who is being observed by software (and with what impact)? It is a question of power, one that we answer, at least in part, with critical play. But also with slow pedagogy.\n\nWe pick up the word \"observation\", turning it over and around. We bring it right up to our noses and hold it outstretched to get a better look, holding all of the histories of people looking at other people in mind, holding terminals and keyboards in hand. We sync our breath to the rhythm of our software. We propose holistic observation as a way to approach software, as one way to organize engagement with its implications. Observation, and the enabling of it through intensive data-centric feedback mechanisms, is part of the cybernetic spells that underpin present day software production.\n\nWe respond by cargo cult programming \nwe name the actors, we reject the hierarchies of knowledge, deflect erasures, \nsome call this cargo-culting, we call it method, rejecting their colonial presumption that functionality is the only purpose, and expertise is the only source of knowlede misunderstanding\ncriteria for inclusion\nritual includsion of code with no real purpose, we reject optimization as the only value \nritual of shotgun debugging or deep magic\nWe question the naming of the non functional as unnecessary, we question the description of code as self-explanatory \n\n\nOur aim was to scrutinize this methodology in its many manifestations, including in \"observatories\" -- high cost infrastructures of observation troubled by colonial, imperial, empirical traditions and their problematic divisions of nature and culture. And through scrutiny, we hope to open up a set of questions about who gets to observe software (and how) and who is being observed by software (and with what impact)? It is a question of power, one that we answer, at least in part, with critical play. But also with slow pedagogy.\n\n\n\n\ngold:\n\nTogether we picked up the word \"observation\", turning it over and around. We are here to help you get a better look, holding all of the stories of people looking for people in mind, holding terminals and keyboards in hand. We see how to approach the software, how to organize and engage with its implications. Observation, and the enabling of it through intensive data-centric feedback mechanisms, is part of the cybernetic principles that underpin present day software production.\n\n\nWe are techno-galactic as we meet the contemporary paradigms of computation that proudly announce their capability for \"scaling up to the universe.\" We stand here as modest witnesses to the scales of software communities and related political economies that involve and require observation.\n\nThis guide offers a set of practical and fantastical tools for the tactical (mis)use of software, empowering/enabling users to resist embedded paradigms and assumptions. It is a collection of methods for approaching software, experiencing its myths and realities, its risks and benefits. Drawing on theories of software and computation developed in academia and elsewhere, we grounded our methods in hands-on exercises and experiments that you now can try at home. This Guide to Techno-Galactic Software Observation offers methods developed in and inspired by the context of software production, hacker culture, software studies, computer science research, Free Software communities, privacy activism, and artistic practice. It invites you to experiment with ways to stay with the trouble of software. Come join us at the edge of the universe, on the metro platform, at your kitchen table, as we mark and measure critical distances from and entanglements with the seemingly endless software systems that surround us.\n\nThe techno-galactic software survival guide was collectively produced as an outcome of the Techno-Galactic Software Observatory. \n[This feels like it could be in a different font size or in brackets or is the start of the next page/spread?]\n\n\nRemaining thoughts/notes for inspiration:\nYou may want to just throw all your devices away, but before you do so, wouldn't you want to, for once poke them back?\nYou may think about retreating to a wooden cabin, and live a software-free life, but even then, do you think you could manage without talking about your past software troubles.\nAnd, how about those drawings at the nearby cave, that look eerily similar to an ancient flowchart, you think you can just ignore its poetry?\n\nkostas axelos, planetary interlude, maybe some bits fit with the intro?:\n\n%  We open ourselves to abysses and we are swallowed up in sys-\n%  tems and totalizations - for these are fragments and segments of\n%  \"totality\" which establish themselves as total and/or partial totali-\n%  tarisms - without foreseeing what might be the home, the house, the\n%  habitat of living, thinking man, an unfinished, unfinishable being in a\n%  history which is equally so, neither a shell stuck fast to a rock, nor a\n%  simple nomad or vagabond. Mortals wish for the familiar and for\n%  adventure, the known and the unknown, undecided as to who decides\n%  and to what he decides, chosen rather than choosing. Since they are\n%  unable to be their own master, they allow themselves to be fixed,\n%  tossed about, carried away, scattered and put to flight, incapable of\n%  choosing - if choice there be - between success in and in relation to\n%  the world, and the World. All this does not constitute an error; wan-\n%  dering (errance) commands it. \n Galactic irony is watching us. \n%  Dream of a shadow and dispenser of light, conquistador and\n%  deserter of the World, pawn and pioneer, man sets out to conquer\n%  the stars and he ploughs the sea. The assault he launches against the\n%  astral earth and against the celestial stars is not without disaster.\n Whether he delves into analysis and disintegration -- since he needs\n analyses, concrete and tangible solutions and experimentations -- or\n whether he plunges into syntheses -- since the abstracting power and\n the ungraspable attract him equally --, as precisely and as far as he\n may cast his nets, what his nets catch and what passes through them\n communicate. Never quite awake and never quite beclouded, will we\n learn to live and to see beings and things simultaneously from close\n up and far away, large and small, in their and in our wandering\n (errance), in the great World which is at the same time small, where\n there are no victors - would there be vanquished?\n\n## The Techno-Galactic Software Observatory\n\nIn the summer of 2017, thirty or so people gathered in Brussels to explore practices of proximate critique with and of software in the context of a worksession entitled \"Techno-Galactic Software Observatory\".[^]{Worksessions are intensive transdisciplinary moments, organised twice a year by Constant. They aim to provide conditions for participants with different experiences and capabilities to temporarily link their practice and to  develop ideas, prototypes and  research projects together. For the worksessions, primarily Free, Libre and Open Source software is used and material that is available under Open Content Licenses.} The worksession called for software-curious people of all kinds to ask questions about software. The intuition behind such a call was that developing different types of engagement requires a heterogeneous group of participants with different levels of expertise,  skill and background. During three sessions that were two days each, participants collectively inspected the space-time of computation and probed the universe of hardware-software separations through excursions, exercises and conversations. They tried out various perspectives and methods to look at the larger picture of software as a concept, as a practice, and as a set of techniques.\n\nThe first two days of The Techno-Galactic Software Observatory included visits to the Musée de l'Informatique Pionnière en Belgique [^]{http://www.nam-ip.be} in Namur and the Computermuseum KULeuven[^]{http://etwie.be/database/actor/computermuseum-ku-leuven}. Surrounded by these collections of historical ’numerical artefacts’, we started considering software in a long-term context (% CARLINSAYS: Do we mean a long historical context or longue duree or something else?). The museum visits provided an occasion to reflect on the conditions of software's appearance (% CARLINSAYS: appearances?) and to take on current-day questions from a genealogical perspective. What is software? How did it appear as a concept, in what industrial and governmental circumstances? What happens to the material conditions of its production (minerals, factory labor, hardware) when it evaporates into a cloud?\n\nThe second two days were spent focusing on the space-time dimension of IT development. The way computer programs and operating systems are manufactured has changed tremendously over the last seventy years, as has its production times and places. From military labs to the mega-corporation cubicles to the open-space freelancer utopia, what ruptures and continuities can be traced in the production, deployment, maintenance and destruction of software? From time-sharing to user-space partitions and containerization, what separations were and are at work? Where and when is software made today?\n\nThe last two days at the Techno-Galactic Software Observatory were dedicated to observation and its consequences. The development of software encompasses a series of practices whose evocative names are increasingly familiar: feedback, report, probe, audit, inspect, scan, diagnose, explore, test. What are the systems of knowledge and power within which these activities take place, and what other types of observation are possible? As a practical set for our investigations, we set up a walk-in clinic on the 25th floor of the World Trade Center, where users and developers could arrive with software-questions of all kinds.\n\n## The Walk-in Clinic (% CARLINSAYS: I think this title should go below the description of the walk-in clinic as the last two days of the observatory worksession and should come instead right above the invitation to the clinic so I have moved it there)\n\n> Do you suffer from the disappearance of your software into the cloud,\n> feel oppressed by unequal user privilege, or experience the torment of\n> software-ransom of any sort?\n> Bring your devices and interfaces to the World Trade Center!\n> With the help of a clear and in-depth session, at the Techno-Galactic\n> Walk-In Clinic we guarantee immediate results.\n> The  Walk-In Clinic provides free hands-on observations to software\n> curious  people of all kinds.

Software Observation\" or something else?)\n\n> I am less interested in the critical practice of reflection,\n> of showing once-again that the emperor has no clothes, than in\n> finding a way to diffract critical inquiry in order to make\n> difference patterns in a more worldly way.\n> [@haraway:1996:witness]\n% p429, Haraway, modest witness, 1996 from: http://observatory.constantvzw.org/etherdump/friday.md.diff.html\n\n \nA spectre is haunting the galaxy. It is neither revolutionary [@marx:1848:cmanifesto] nor is it a global scale vulnerability [@meltdown:2018:spectre17], but no matter where you happen to be, there is the spectre of a software running somewhere in the background. Look! There it is, looking right back at you. Be it your phone screen or a passing satellite, software's observation and entanglement in the everyday appears complete. \n\nBut is it so total? The Techno-Galactic Software Survival Guide is an obsessive fantasy of optimization turned on its head, and stuck to the ceiling of a self-reflecting elevator. It is the ultimate book of dos and don'ts, of forgotten histories and un-inevitable futures, of mindful agile actions and improvisational service architectures, of any and all things that you can and cannot imagine needing in a techno-galaxy. Reading is not enough, software is not just a text, observation is one potential beginning, engagement is tickling.\n\n(%CARLINSAYS: This felt like it needed a transition in order to not leave tickling hanging and to have a logic for why this comes next)\nWhere to approach? The anticipation of a touch that cannot be born with a straight face.  Here is one possible first point of contact. A1960s dream of online services was revived in the 1990s [@haigh:2001:soft60]. Since then the use of software has increasingly been knitted into the production of software, even while the rhetoric, rights and procedures continue to suggest that use and production constitute separate realms. This knitting together and its corresponding disavowal has an effect on the way software is used and produced that radically alters its operative role in society. The shifts ripple across galaxies, through social structures, working conditions and personal relations, resulting in a profusion of apparatuses aspiring to be seamless while optimizing and monetizing individual and collective flows of information in line with the interests of a handful of actors. The diffusion of software services affects the personal, in the form of intensified identity shaping and self-management. It also affects the public, as more and more libraries, universities and public infrastructures as well as the management of public life rely on \"solutions\" provided by private companies. Centralizing data flows in the clouds, services blur the last traces of the thin line that separates bio- from necro-politics.\n\n\nGiven how fast software resonates and reproduces, there is a growing urgency to engage with it in manners that goes beyond taking a distance, and that deal with the fact that we are inevitably already entangled. (% CARLINSAYS: repetitive?) How can we interact, respond and think with software? What approaches can we use to recognize the agency of different actors, their ways of working and their politics? What methods of observation are conducive to critical inquiry and affirmative discord? What techniques can we apply to resurface software, finding the sites where their infrastructures are reconfiguring the everyday? How can we remember that software is always at work, especially where it is designed to disappear into the background? \n\nWe pick up the word \"observation\", turning it over and around. (% CARLINSAYS: use past tense?) We are looking forward to a better look , holding all of the stories of people looking at people in mind, holding terminals and keyboards in hand. We sync our breath to the rhythm of our software. We look at this wholistic observation as a way to approach software, as one way to organize engagement with its implications. Observation, and the Enabling of it intensively through data-centric Feedback Mechanisms, is share of the cybernetic spell That underpins present day software production. Our aim was ??to scrutinize this methodology in its many manifestations, including in \"observatories\" - high cost infrastructures of observation troubled by colonial, imperial, empirical traditions and their problematic divisions of nature and culture. And through scrutiny, what do you think about who gets to watch software (and how) and who is being observed by software (and with what impact)? It is a question of power, one that we answer, at least in part, with critical play. But also with slow pedagogy.\n\nWe pick up the word \"observation\", turning it over and around. We bring it right up to our noses and hold it outstretched to get a better look, holding all of the histories of people looking at other people in mind, holding terminals and keyboards in hand. We sync our breath to the rhythm of our software. We propose holistic observation as a way to approach software, as one way to organize engagement with its implications. Observation, and the enabling of it through intensive data-centric feedback mechanisms, is part of the cybernetic spells that underpin present day software production.\n\nWe respond by cargo cult programming \nwe name the actors, we reject the hierarchies of knowledge, deflect erasures, \nsome call this cargo-culting, we call it method, rejecting their colonial presumption that functionality is the only purpose, and expertise is the only source of knowlede misunderstanding\ncriteria for inclusion\nritual includsion of code with no real purpose, we reject optimization as the only value \nritual of shotgun debugging or deep magic\nWe question the naming of the non functional as unnecessary, we question the description of code as self-explanatory \n\n\nOur aim was to scrutinize this methodology in its many manifestations, including in \"observatories\" -- high cost infrastructures of observation troubled by colonial, imperial, empirical traditions and their problematic divisions of nature and culture. And through scrutiny, we hope to open up a set of questions about who gets to observe software (and how) and who is being observed by software (and with what impact)? It is a question of power, one that we answer, at least in part, with critical play. But also with slow pedagogy.\n\n\n\n\ngold:\n\nTogether we picked up the word \"observation\", turning it over and around. We are here to help you get a better look, holding all of the stories of people looking for people in mind, holding terminals and keyboards in hand. We see how to approach the software, how to organize and engage with its implications. Observation, and the enabling of it through intensive data-centric feedback mechanisms, is part of the cybernetic principles that underpin present day software production.\n\n\nWe are techno-galactic as we meet the contemporary paradigms of computation that proudly announce their capability for \"scaling up to the universe.\" We stand here as modest witnesses to the scales of software communities and related political economies that involve and require observation.\n\nThis guide offers a set of practical and fantastical tools for the tactical (mis)use of software, empowering/enabling users to resist embedded paradigms and assumptions. It is a collection of methods for approaching software, experiencing its myths and realities, its risks and benefits. Drawing on theories of software and computation developed in academia and elsewhere, we grounded our methods in hands-on exercises and experiments that you now can try at home. This Guide to Techno-Galactic Software Observation offers methods developed in and inspired by the context of software production, hacker culture, software studies, computer science research, Free Software communities, privacy activism, and artistic practice. It invites you to experiment with ways to stay with the trouble of software. Come join us at the edge of the universe, on the metro platform, at your kitchen table, as we mark and measure critical distances from and entanglements with the seemingly endless software systems that surround us.\n\nThe techno-galactic software survival guide was collectively produced as an outcome of the Techno-Galactic Software Observatory. \n[This feels like it could be in a different font size or in brackets or is the start of the next page/spread?]\n\n\nRemaining thoughts/notes for inspiration:\nYou may want to just throw all your devices away, but before you do so, wouldn't you want to, for once poke them back?\nYou may think about retreating to a wooden cabin, and live a software-free life, but even then, do you think you could manage without talking about your past software troubles.\nAnd, how about those drawings at the nearby cave, that look eerily similar to an ancient flowchart, you think you can just ignore its poetry?\n\nkostas axelos, planetary interlude, maybe some bits fit with the intro?:\n\n%  We open ourselves to abysses and we are swallowed up in sys-\n%  tems and totalizations - for these are fragments and segments of\n%  \"totality\" which establish themselves as total and/or partial totali-\n%  tarisms - without foreseeing what might be the home, the house, the\n%  habitat of living, thinking man, an unfinished, unfinishable being in a\n%  history which is equally so, neither a shell stuck fast to a rock, nor a\n%  simple nomad or vagabond. Mortals wish for the familiar and for\n%  adventure, the known and the unknown, undecided as to who decides\n%  and to what he decides, chosen rather than choosing. Since they are\n%  unable to be their own master, they allow themselves to be fixed,\n%  tossed about, carried away, scattered and put to flight, incapable of\n%  choosing - if choice there be - between success in and in relation to\n%  the world, and the World. All this does not constitute an error; wan-\n%  dering (errance) commands it. \n Galactic irony is watching us. \n%  Dream of a shadow and dispenser of light, conquistador and\n%  deserter of the World, pawn and pioneer, man sets out to conquer\n%  the stars and he ploughs the sea. The assault he launches against the\n%  astral earth and against the celestial stars is not without disaster.\n Whether he delves into analysis and disintegration -- since he needs\n analyses, concrete and tangible solutions and experimentations -- or\n whether he plunges into syntheses -- since the abstracting power and\n the ungraspable attract him equally --, as precisely and as far as he\n may cast his nets, what his nets catch and what passes through them\n communicate. Never quite awake and never quite beclouded, will we\n learn to live and to see beings and things simultaneously from close\n up and far away, large and small, in their and in our wandering\n (errance), in the great World which is at the same time small, where\n there are no victors - would there be vanquished?\n\n## The Techno-Galactic Software Observatory\n\nIn the summer of 2017, thirty or so people gathered in Brussels to explore practices of proximate critique with and of software in the context of a worksession entitled \"Techno-Galactic Software Observatory\".[^]{Worksessions are intensive transdisciplinary moments, organised twice a year by Constant. They aim to provide conditions for participants with different experiences and capabilities to temporarily link their practice and to  develop ideas, prototypes and  research projects together. For the worksessions, primarily Free, Libre and Open Source software is used and material that is available under Open Content Licenses.} The worksession called for software-curious people of all kinds to ask questions about software. The intuition behind such a call was that developing different types of engagement requires a heterogeneous group of participants with different levels of expertise,  skill and background. During three sessions that were two days each, participants collectively inspected the space-time of computation and probed the universe of hardware-software separations through excursions, exercises and conversations. They tried out various perspectives and methods to look at the larger picture of software as a concept, as a practice, and as a set of techniques.\n\nThe first two days of The Techno-Galactic Software Observatory included visits to the Musée de l'Informatique Pionnière en Belgique [^]{http://www.nam-ip.be} in Namur and the Computermuseum KULeuven[^]{http://etwie.be/database/actor/computermuseum-ku-leuven}. Surrounded by these collections of historical ’numerical artefacts’, we started considering software in a long-term context (% CARLINSAYS: Do we mean a long historical context or longue duree or something else?). The museum visits provided an occasion to reflect on the conditions of software's appearance (% CARLINSAYS: appearances?) and to take on current-day questions from a genealogical perspective. What is software? How did it appear as a concept, in what industrial and governmental circumstances? What happens to the material conditions of its production (minerals, factory labor, hardware) when it evaporates into a cloud?\n\nThe second two days were spent focusing on the space-time dimension of IT development. The way computer programs and operating systems are manufactured has changed tremendously over the last seventy years, as has its production times and places. From military labs to the mega-corporation cubicles to the open-space freelancer utopia, what ruptures and continuities can be traced in the production, deployment, maintenance and destruction of software? From time-sharing to user-space partitions and containerization, what separations were and are at work? Where and when is software made today?\n\nThe last two days at the Techno-Galactic Software Observatory were dedicated to observation and its consequences. The development of software encompasses a series of practices whose evocative names are increasingly familiar: feedback, report, probe, audit, inspect, scan, diagnose, explore, test. What are the systems of knowledge and power within which these activities take place, and what other types of observation are possible? As a practical set for our investigations, we set up a walk-in clinic on the 25th floor of the World Trade Center, where users and developers could arrive with software-questions of all kinds.\n\n## The Walk-in Clinic (% CARLINSAYS: I think this title should go below the description of the walk-in clinic as the last two days of the observatory worksession and should come instead right above the invitation to the clinic so I have moved it there)\n\n> Do you suffer from the disappearance of your software into the cloud,\n> feel oppressed by unequal user privilege, or experience the torment of\n> software-ransom of any sort?\n> Bring your devices and interfaces to the World Trade Center!\n> With the help of a clear and in-depth session, at the Techno-Galactic\n> Walk-In Clinic we guarantee immediate results.\n> The  Walk-In Clinic provides free hands-on observations to software\n> curious  people of all kinds.

\"A Guide to Techno-Galactic Software Observation\" or \"The Techno-Galactic Guide to Software Observation\" or something else?)\n\n> I am less interested in the critical practice of reflection,\n> of showing once-again that the emperor has no clothes, than in\n> finding a way to diffract critical inquiry in order to make\n> difference patterns in a more worldly way.\n> [@haraway:1996:witness]\n% p429, Haraway, modest witness, 1996 from: http://observatory.constantvzw.org/etherdump/friday.md.diff.html\n\n \nA spectre is haunting the galaxy. It is neither revolutionary [@marx:1848:cmanifesto] nor is it a global scale vulnerability [@meltdown:2018:spectre17], but no matter where you happen to be, there is the spectre of a software running somewhere in the background. Look! There it is, looking right back at you. Be it your phone screen or a passing satellite, software's observation and entanglement in the everyday appears complete. \n\nBut is it so total? The Techno-Galactic Software Survival Guide is an obsessive fantasy of optimization turned on its head, and stuck to the ceiling of a self-reflecting elevator. It is the ultimate book of dos and don'ts, of forgotten histories and un-inevitable futures, of mindful agile actions and improvisational service architectures, of any and all things that you can and cannot imagine needing in a techno-galaxy. Reading is not enough, software is not just a text, observation is one potential beginning, engagement is tickling.\n\n(%CARLINSAYS: This felt like it needed a transition in order to not leave tickling hanging and to have a logic for why this comes next)\nCall up that fe anticipation of a touch that cannot be born with a straight face. The concept and structure of service offers one possible first point of contact. A 1960s dream of online services was revived in the 1990s [@haigh:2001:soft60]. Since then the use of software has increasingly been knitted into the production of software, even while the rhetoric, rights and procedures continue to suggest that use and production constitute separate realms. This knitting together and its corresponding disavowal has an effect on the way software is used and produced that radically alters its operative role in society. The shifts ripple across galaxies, through social structures, working conditions and personal relations, resulting in a profusion of apparatuses aspiring to be seamless while optimizing and monetizing individual and collective flows of information in line with the interests of a handful of actors. The diffusion of software services affects the individual (%CARLINSAYS: this was \"personal\" but individual is a better pair with \"public\" we could also use \"individual person\" or other suggestions?), in the form of intensified identity shaping and self-management. It also affects the public, as more and more libraries, universities and public infrastructures as well as the management of public life rely on \"solutions\" provided by private companies. Centralizing data flows in the clouds, services blur the last traces of the thin line that separates bio- from necro-politics.\n\n\nGiven how fast software resonates and reproduces, there is a growing urgency to engage with it in manners that goes beyond taking a distance, and that deal with the fact that we are inevitably already entangled. (% CARLINSAYS: repetitive?) How can we interact, respond and think with software? What approaches can we use to recognize the agency of different actors, their ways of working and their politics? What methods of observation are conducive to critical inquiry and affirmative discord? What techniques can we apply to resurface software, finding the sites where their infrastructures are reconfiguring the everyday? How can we remember that software is always at work, especially where it is designed to disappear into the background? \n\nWe pick up the word \"observation\", turning it over and around. (% CARLINSAYS: use past tense?) We are looking forward to a better look , holding all of the stories of people looking at people in mind, holding terminals and keyboards in hand. We sync our breath to the rhythm of our software. We look at this wholistic observation as a way to approach software, as one way to organize engagement with its implications. Observation, and the Enabling of it intensively through data-centric Feedback Mechanisms, is share of the cybernetic spell That underpins present day software production. Our aim was ??to scrutinize this methodology in its many manifestations, including in \"observatories\" - high cost infrastructures of observation troubled by colonial, imperial, empirical traditions and their problematic divisions of nature and culture. And through scrutiny, what do you think about who gets to watch software (and how) and who is being observed by software (and with what impact)? It is a question of power, one that we answer, at least in part, with critical play. But also with slow pedagogy.\n\nWe pick up the word \"observation\", turning it over and around. We bring it right up to our noses and hold it outstretched to get a better look, holding all of the histories of people looking at other people in mind, holding terminals and keyboards in hand. We sync our breath to the rhythm of our software. We propose holistic observation as a way to approach software, as one way to organize engagement with its implications. Observation, and the enabling of it through intensive data-centric feedback mechanisms, is part of the cybernetic spells that underpin present day software production.\n\nWe respond by cargo cult programming \nwe name the actors, we reject the hierarchies of knowledge, deflect erasures, \nsome call this cargo-culting, we call it method, rejecting their colonial presumption that functionality is the only purpose, and expertise is the only source of knowlede misunderstanding\ncriteria for inclusion\nritual includsion of code with no real purpose, we reject optimization as the only value \nritual of shotgun debugging or deep magic\nWe question the naming of the non functional as unnecessary, we question the description of code as self-explanatory \n\n\nOur aim was to scrutinize this methodology in its many manifestations, including in \"observatories\" -- high cost infrastructures of observation troubled by colonial, imperial, empirical traditions and their problematic divisions of nature and culture. And through scrutiny, we hope to open up a set of questions about who gets to observe software (and how) and who is being observed by software (and with what impact)? It is a question of power, one that we answer, at least in part, with critical play. But also with slow pedagogy.\n\n\n\n\ngold:\n\nTogether we picked up the word \"observation\", turning it over and around. We are here to help you get a better look, holding all of the stories of people looking for people in mind, holding terminals and keyboards in hand. We see how to approach the software, how to organize and engage with its implications. Observation, and the enabling of it through intensive data-centric feedback mechanisms, is part of the cybernetic principles that underpin present day software production.\n\n\nWe are techno-galactic as we meet the contemporary paradigms of computation that proudly announce their capability for \"scaling up to the universe.\" We stand here as modest witnesses to the scales of software communities and related political economies that involve and require observation.\n\nThis guide offers a set of practical and fantastical tools for the tactical (mis)use of software, empowering/enabling users to resist embedded paradigms and assumptions. It is a collection of methods for approaching software, experiencing its myths and realities, its risks and benefits. Drawing on theories of software and computation developed in academia and elsewhere, we grounded our methods in hands-on exercises and experiments that you now can try at home. This Guide to Techno-Galactic Software Observation offers methods developed in and inspired by the context of software production, hacker culture, software studies, computer science research, Free Software communities, privacy activism, and artistic practice. It invites you to experiment with ways to stay with the trouble of software. Come join us at the edge of the universe, on the metro platform, at your kitchen table, as we mark and measure critical distances from and entanglements with the seemingly endless software systems that surround us.\n\nThe techno-galactic software survival guide was collectively produced as an outcome of the Techno-Galactic Software Observatory. \n[This feels like it could be in a different font size or in brackets or is the start of the next page/spread?]\n\n\nRemaining thoughts/notes for inspiration:\nYou may want to just throw all your devices away, but before you do so, wouldn't you want to, for once poke them back?\nYou may think about retreating to a wooden cabin, and live a software-free life, but even then, do you think you could manage without talking about your past software troubles.\nAnd, how about those drawings at the nearby cave, that look eerily similar to an ancient flowchart, you think you can just ignore its poetry?\n\nkostas axelos, planetary interlude, maybe some bits fit with the intro?:\n\n%  We open ourselves to abysses and we are swallowed up in sys-\n%  tems and totalizations - for these are fragments and segments of\n%  \"totality\" which establish themselves as total and/or partial totali-\n%  tarisms - without foreseeing what might be the home, the house, the\n%  habitat of living, thinking man, an unfinished, unfinishable being in a\n%  history which is equally so, neither a shell stuck fast to a rock, nor a\n%  simple nomad or vagabond. Mortals wish for the familiar and for\n%  adventure, the known and the unknown, undecided as to who decides\n%  and to what he decides, chosen rather than choosing. Since they are\n%  unable to be their own master, they allow themselves to be fixed,\n%  tossed about, carried away, scattered and put to flight, incapable of\n%  choosing - if choice there be - between success in and in relation to\n%  the world, and the World. All this does not constitute an error; wan-\n%  dering (errance) commands it. \n Galactic irony is watching us. \n%  Dream of a shadow and dispenser of light, conquistador and\n%  deserter of the World, pawn and pioneer, man sets out to conquer\n%  the stars and he ploughs the sea. The assault he launches against the\n%  astral earth and against the celestial stars is not without disaster.\n Whether he delves into analysis and disintegration -- since he needs\n analyses, concrete and tangible solutions and experimentations -- or\n whether he plunges into syntheses -- since the abstracting power and\n the ungraspable attract him equally --, as precisely and as far as he\n may cast his nets, what his nets catch and what passes through them\n communicate. Never quite awake and never quite beclouded, will we\n learn to live and to see beings and things simultaneously from close\n up and far away, large and small, in their and in our wandering\n (errance), in the great World which is at the same time small, where\n there are no victors - would there be vanquished?\n\n## The Techno-Galactic Software Observatory\n\nIn the summer of 2017, thirty or so people gathered in Brussels to explore practices of proximate critique with and of software in the context of a worksession entitled \"Techno-Galactic Software Observatory\".[^]{Worksessions are intensive transdisciplinary moments, organised twice a year by Constant. They aim to provide conditions for participants with different experiences and capabilities to temporarily link their practice and to  develop ideas, prototypes and  research projects together. For the worksessions, primarily Free, Libre and Open Source software is used and material that is available under Open Content Licenses.} The worksession called for software-curious people of all kinds to ask questions about software. The intuition behind such a call was that developing different types of engagement requires a heterogeneous group of participants with different levels of expertise,  skill and background. During three sessions that were two days each, participants collectively inspected the space-time of computation and probed the universe of hardware-software separations through excursions, exercises and conversations. They tried out various perspectives and methods to look at the larger picture of software as a concept, as a practice, and as a set of techniques.\n\nThe first two days of The Techno-Galactic Software Observatory included visits to the Musée de l'Informatique Pionnière en Belgique [^]{http://www.nam-ip.be} in Namur and the Computermuseum KULeuven[^]{http://etwie.be/database/actor/computermuseum-ku-leuven}. Surrounded by these collections of historical ’numerical artefacts’, we started considering software in a long-term context (% CARLINSAYS: Do we mean a long historical context or longue duree or something else?). The museum visits provided an occasion to reflect on the conditions of software's appearance (% CARLINSAYS: appearances?) and to take on current-day questions from a genealogical perspective. What is software? How did it appear as a concept, in what industrial and governmental circumstances? What happens to the material conditions of its production (minerals, factory labor, hardware) when it evaporates into a cloud?\n\nThe second two days were spent focusing on the space-time dimension of IT development. The way computer programs and operating systems are manufactured has changed tremendously over the last seventy years, as has its production times and places. From military labs to the mega-corporation cubicles to the open-space freelancer utopia, what ruptures and continuities can be traced in the production, deployment, maintenance and destruction of software? From time-sharing to user-space partitions and containerization, what separations were and are at work? Where and when is software made today?\n\nThe last two days at the Techno-Galactic Software Observatory were dedicated to observation and its consequences. The development of software encompasses a series of practices whose evocative names are increasingly familiar: feedback, report, probe, audit, inspect, scan, diagnose, explore, test. What are the systems of knowledge and power within which these activities take place, and what other types of observation are possible? As a practical set for our investigations, we set up a walk-in clinic on the 25th floor of the World Trade Center, where users and developers could arrive with software-questions of all kinds.\n\n## The Walk-in Clinic (% CARLINSAYS: I think this title should go below the description of the walk-in clinic as the last two days of the observatory worksession and should come instead right above the invitation to the clinic so I have moved it there)\n\n> Do you suffer from the disappearance of your software into the cloud,\n> feel oppressed by unequal user privilege, or experience the torment of\n> software-ransom of any sort?\n> Bring your devices and interfaces to the World Trade Center!\n> With the help of a clear and in-depth session, at the Techno-Galactic\n> Walk-In Clinic we guarantee immediate results.\n> The  Walk-In Clinic provides free hands-on observations to software\n> curious  people of all kinds.

Software Observation\" or \"The Techno-Galactic Software Survival Guide\" or?)\n\n> I am less interested in the critical practice of reflection,\n> of showing once-again that the emperor has no

http://observatory.constantvzw.org/etherdump/friday.md.diff.html\n\n (%CARLINSAYS: Software is everywhere)\nA spectre is haunting the galaxy. It is neither revolutionary [@marx:1848:cmanifesto] nor is it a global scale vulnerability [@meltdown:2018:spectre17], but no matter where you happen to be, there is the spectre of a software running somewhere in the background. Look! There it is, looking right back at you. Be it your phone screen or a passing satellite, software's observation and entanglement in the everyday appears complete. \n\n(%CARLINSAYS: This guide is going to playfull\nBut is it so total? The Techno-Galactic Software Survival Guide  is an obsessive fantasy of optimization turned on its head, and stuck to the ceiling of a self-reflecting elevator. It is the ultimate book of dos and don'ts, of forgotten histories and un-inevitable futures, of mindful agile actions and improvisational service architectures, of any and all things that you can and cannot imagine needing in a techno-galaxy. Reading is not enough, software is not just a text, observation is one potential beginning, engagement is tickling.\n\n(%CARLINSAYS: This felt like it needed a transition in order to not leave tickling hanging and to have a logic for why this comes next)\nCan you call up that feeling of anticipation at the approach of a touch that is wanted but that cannot be born with a straight face? The concept and structure of service offers one possible first point of contact. A 1960s dream of online services was revived in the 1990s [@haigh:2001:soft60]. Since then the use of software has increasingly been knitted into the production of software, even while the rhetoric, rights and procedures continue to suggest that use and production constitute separate realms. This knitting together and its corresponding disavowal has an effect on the way software is used and produced that radically alters its operative role in society. The shifts ripple across galaxies, through social structures, working conditions and personal relations, resulting in a profusion of apparatuses aspiring to be seamless while optimizing and monetizing individual and collective flows of information in line with the interests of a handful of actors. The diffusion of software services affects the individual (%CARLINSAYS: this was \"personal\" but individual is a better pair with \"public\" we could also use \"individual person\" or other suggestions?), in the form of intensified identity shaping and self-management. It also affects the public, as more and more libraries, universities and public infrastructures as well as the management of public life rely on \"solutions\" provided by private companies. Centralizing data flows in the clouds, services blur the last traces of the thin line that separates bio- from necro-politics.\n\n\nGiven how fast software resonates and reproduces, there is a growing urgency to engage with it in manners that goes beyond taking a distance, and that deal with the fact that we are inevitably already entangled. (% CARLINSAYS: repetitive?) How can we interact, respond and think with software? What approaches can we use to recognize the agency of different actors, their ways of working and their politics? What methods of observation are conducive to critical inquiry and affirmative discord? What techniques can we apply to resurface software, finding the sites where their infrastructures are reconfiguring the everyday? How can we remember that software is always at work, especially where it is designed to disappear into the background? \n\nWe pick up the word \"observation\", turning it over and around. (% CARLINSAYS: use past tense?) We are looking forward to a better look , holding all of the stories of people looking at people in mind, holding terminals and keyboards in hand. We sync our breath to the rhythm of our software. We look at this wholistic observation as a way to approach software, as one way to organize engagement with its implications. Observation, and the Enabling of it intensively through data-centric Feedback Mechanisms, is share of the cybernetic spell That underpins present day software production. Our aim was ??to scrutinize this methodology in its many manifestations, including in \"observatories\" - high cost infrastructures of observation troubled by colonial, imperial, empirical traditions and their problematic divisions of nature and culture. And through scrutiny, what do you think about who gets to watch software (and how) and who is being observed by software (and with what impact)? It is a question of power, one that we answer, at least in part, with critical play. But also with slow pedagogy.\n\nWe pick up the word \"observation\", turning it over and around. We bring it right up to our noses and hold it outstretched to get a better look, holding all of the histories of people looking at other people in mind, holding terminals and keyboards in hand. We sync our breath to the rhythm of our software. We propose holistic observation as a way to approach software, as one way to organize engagement with its implications. Observation, and the enabling of it through intensive data-centric feedback mechanisms, is part of the cybernetic spells that underpin present day software production.\n\nWe respond by cargo cult programming \nwe name the actors, we reject the hierarchies of knowledge, deflect erasures, \nsome call this cargo-culting, we call it method, rejecting their colonial presumption that functionality is the only purpose, and expertise is the only source of knowlede misunderstanding\ncriteria for inclusion\nritual includsion of code with no real purpose, we reject optimization as the only value \nritual of shotgun debugging or deep magic\nWe question the naming of the non functional as unnecessary, we question the description of code as self-explanatory \n\n\nOur aim was to scrutinize this methodology in its many manifestations, including in \"observatories\" -- high cost infrastructures of observation troubled by colonial, imperial, empirical traditions and their problematic divisions of nature and culture. And through scrutiny, we hope to open up a set of questions about who gets to observe software (and how) and who is being observed by software (and with what impact)? It is a question of power, one that we answer, at least in part, with critical play. But also with slow pedagogy.\n\n\n\n\ngold:\n\nTogether we picked up the word \"observation\", turning it over and around. We are here to help you get a better look, holding all of the stories of people looking for people in mind, holding terminals and keyboards in hand. We see how to approach the software, how to organize and engage with its implications. Observation, and the enabling of it through intensive data-centric feedback mechanisms, is part of the cybernetic principles that underpin present day software production.\n\n\nWe are techno-galactic as we meet the contemporary paradigms of computation that proudly announce their capability for \"scaling up to the universe.\" We stand here as modest witnesses to the scales of software communities and related political economies that involve and require observation.\n\nThis guide offers a set of practical and fantastical tools for the tactical (mis)use of software, empowering/enabling users to resist embedded paradigms and assumptions. It is a collection of methods for approaching software, experiencing its myths and realities, its risks and benefits. Drawing on theories of software and computation developed in academia and elsewhere, we grounded our methods in hands-on exercises and experiments that you now can try at home. This Guide to Techno-Galactic Software Observation offers methods developed in and inspired by the context of software production, hacker culture, software studies, computer science research, Free Software communities, privacy activism, and artistic practice. It invites you to experiment with ways to stay with the trouble of software. Come join us at the edge of the universe, on the metro platform, at your kitchen table, as we mark and measure critical distances from and entanglements with the seemingly endless software systems that surround us.\n\nThe techno-galactic software survival guide was collectively produced as an outcome of the Techno-Galactic Software Observatory. \n[This feels like it could be in a different font size or in brackets or is the start of the next page/spread?]\n\n\nRemaining thoughts/notes for inspiration:\nYou may want to just throw all your devices away, but before you do so, wouldn't you want to, for once poke them back?\nYou may think about retreating to a wooden cabin, and live a software-free life, but even then, do you think you could manage without talking about your past software troubles.\nAnd, how about those drawings at the nearby cave, that look eerily similar to an ancient flowchart, you think you can just ignore its poetry?\n\nkostas axelos, planetary interlude, maybe some bits fit with the intro?:\n\n%  We open ourselves to abysses and we are swallowed up in sys-\n%  tems and totalizations - for these are fragments and segments of\n%  \"totality\" which establish themselves as total and/or partial totali-\n%  tarisms - without foreseeing what might be the home, the house, the\n%  habitat of living, thinking man, an unfinished, unfinishable being in a\n%  history which is equally so, neither a shell stuck fast to a rock, nor a\n%  simple nomad or vagabond. Mortals wish for the familiar and for\n%  adventure, the known and the unknown, undecided as to who decides\n%  and to what he decides, chosen rather than choosing. Since they are\n%  unable to be their own master, they allow themselves to be fixed,\n%  tossed about, carried away, scattered and put to flight, incapable of\n%  choosing - if choice there be - between success in and in relation to\n%  the world, and the World. All this does not constitute an error; wan-\n%  dering (errance) commands it. \n Galactic irony is watching us. \n%  Dream of a shadow and dispenser of light, conquistador and\n%  deserter of the World, pawn and pioneer, man sets out to conquer\n%  the stars and he ploughs the sea. The assault he launches against the\n%  astral earth and against the celestial stars is not without disaster.\n Whether he delves into analysis and disintegration -- since he needs\n analyses, concrete and tangible solutions and experimentations -- or\n whether he plunges into syntheses -- since the abstracting power and\n the ungraspable attract him equally --, as precisely and as far as he\n may cast his nets, what his nets catch and what passes through them\n communicate. Never quite awake and never quite beclouded, will we\n learn to live and to see beings and things simultaneously from close\n up and far away, large and small, in their and in our wandering\n (errance), in the great World which is at the same time small, where\n there are no victors - would there be vanquished?\n\n## The Techno-Galactic Software Observatory\n\nIn the summer of 2017, thirty or so people gathered in Brussels to explore practices of proximate critique with and of software in the context of a worksession entitled \"Techno-Galactic Software Observatory\".[^]{Worksessions are intensive transdisciplinary moments, organised twice a year by Constant. They aim to provide conditions for participants with different experiences and capabilities to temporarily link their practice and to  develop ideas, prototypes and  research projects together. For the worksessions, primarily Free, Libre and Open Source software is used and material that is available under Open Content Licenses.} The worksession called for software-curious people of all kinds to ask questions about software. The intuition behind such a call was that developing different types of engagement requires a heterogeneous group of participants with different levels of expertise,  skill and background. During three sessions that were two days each, participants collectively inspected the space-time of computation and probed the universe of hardware-software separations through excursions, exercises and conversations. They tried out various perspectives and methods to look at the larger picture of software as a concept, as a practice, and as a set of techniques.\n\nThe first two days of The Techno-Galactic Software Observatory included visits to the Musée de l'Informatique Pionnière en Belgique [^]{http://www.nam-ip.be} in Namur and the Computermuseum KULeuven[^]{http://etwie.be/database/actor/computermuseum-ku-leuven}. Surrounded by these collections of historical ’numerical artefacts’, we started considering software in a long-term context (% CARLINSAYS: Do we mean a long historical context or longue duree or something else?). The museum visits provided an occasion to reflect on the conditions of software's appearance (% CARLINSAYS: appearances?) and to take on current-day questions from a genealogical perspective. What is software? How did it appear as a concept, in what industrial and governmental circumstances? What happens to the material conditions of its production (minerals, factory labor, hardware) when it evaporates into a cloud?\n\nThe second two days were spent focusing on the space-time dimension of IT development. The way computer programs and operating systems are manufactured has changed tremendously over the last seventy years, as has its production times and places. From military labs to the mega-corporation cubicles to the open-space freelancer utopia, what ruptures and continuities can be traced in the production, deployment, maintenance and destruction of software? From time-sharing to user-space partitions and containerization, what separations were and are at work? Where and when is software made today?\n\nThe last two days at the Techno-Galactic Software Observatory were dedicated to observation and its consequences. The development of software encompasses a series of practices whose evocative names are increasingly familiar: feedback, report, probe, audit, inspect, scan, diagnose, explore, test. What are the systems of knowledge and power within which these activities take place, and what other types of observation are possible? As a practical set for our investigations, we set up a walk-in clinic on the 25th floor of the World Trade Center, where users and developers could arrive with software-questions of all kinds.\n\n## The Walk-in Clinic (% CARLINSAYS: I think this title should go below the description of the walk-in clinic as the last two days of the observatory worksession and should come instead right above the invitation to the clinic so I have moved it there)\n\n> Do you suffer from the disappearance of your software into the cloud,\n> feel oppressed by unequal user privilege, or experience the torment of\n> software-ransom of any sort?\n> Bring your devices and interfaces to the World Trade Center!\n> With the help of a clear and in-depth session, at the Techno-Galactic\n> Walk-In Clinic we guarantee immediate results.\n> The  Walk-In Clinic provides free hands-on observations to software\n> curious  people of all kinds.

spectre is haunting the galaxy. It is neither revolutionary [@marx:1848:cmanifesto] nor is it a global scale vulnerability [@meltdown:2018:spectre17], but no matter where you happen to be, there is the spectre of a software running somewhere in the background. Look! There it is, looking right back at you. Be it your phone screen or a passing satellite, software's observation and entanglement in the everyday appears complete. But is it so total? Look again. (%CARLINSAYS: I think this makes more sense up here)\n\n(%CARLINSAYS: This guide is XYZ and it tic)\nThe Techno-Galactic Software Survival Guide  is an obsessive fantasy of optimization turned on its head, and stuck to the ceiling of a self-reflecting elevator. It is the ultimate book of dos and don'ts, of forgotten histories and un-inevitable futures, of mindful agile actions and improvisational service architectures, of any and all things that you can and cannot imagine needing in a techno-galaxy. Reading is not enough, software is not just a text, observation is one potential beginning, engagement is tickling.\n\n(%CARLINSAYS: Online services have altered software and reconfigured society)\nCan you call up that feeling of anticipation at the approach of a touch that is wanted but that cannot be born with a straight face? The concept and structure of service offers one possible first point of contact. A 1960s dream of online services was revived in the 1990s [@haigh:2001:soft60]. Since then the use of software has increasingly been knitted into the production of software, even while the rhetoric, rights and procedures continue to suggest that use and production constitute separate realms. This knitting together and its corresponding disavowal has an effect on the way software is used and produced that radically alters its operative role in society. The shifts ripple across galaxies, through social structures, working conditions and personal relations, resulting in a profusion of apparatuses aspiring to be seamless while optimizing and monetizing individual and collective flows of information in line with the interests of a handful of actors. The diffusion of software services affects the individual (%CARLINSAYS: this was \"personal\" but individual is a better pair with \"public\" we could also use \"individual person\" or other suggestions?), in the form of intensified identity shaping and self-management. It also affects the public, as more and more libraries, universities and public infrastructures as well as the management of public life rely on \"solutions\" provided by private companies. Centralizing data flows in the clouds, services blur the last traces of the thin line that separates bio- from necro-politics.\n\n\nGiven how fast software resonates and reproduces, there is a growing urgency to engage with it in manners that goes beyond taking a distance, and that deal with the fact that we are inevitably already entangled. (% CARLINSAYS: repetitive?) How can we interact, respond and think with software? What approaches can we use to recognize the agency of different actors, their ways of working and their politics? What methods of observation are conducive to critical inquiry and affirmative discord? What techniques can we apply to resurface software, finding the sites where their infrastructures are reconfiguring the everyday? How can we remember that software is always at work, especially where it is designed to disappear into the background? \n\nWe pick up the word \"observation\", turning it over and around. (% CARLINSAYS: use past tense?) We are looking forward to a better look , holding all of the stories of people looking at people in mind, holding terminals and keyboards in hand. We sync our breath to the rhythm of our software. We look at this wholistic observation as a way to approach software, as one way to organize engagement with its implications. Observation, and the Enabling of it intensively through data-centric Feedback Mechanisms, is share of the cybernetic spell That underpins present day software production. Our aim was ??to scrutinize this methodology in its many manifestations, including in \"observatories\" - high cost infrastructures of observation troubled by colonial, imperial, empirical traditions and their problematic divisions of nature and culture. And through scrutiny, what do you think about who gets to watch software (and how) and who is being observed by software (and with what impact)? It is a question of power, one that we answer, at least in part, with critical play. But also with slow pedagogy.\n\nWe pick up the word \"observation\", turning it over and around. We bring it right up to our noses and hold it outstretched to get a better look, holding all of the histories of people looking at other people in mind, holding terminals and keyboards in hand. We sync our breath to the rhythm of our software. We propose holistic observation as a way to approach software, as one way to organize engagement with its implications. Observation, and the enabling of it through intensive data-centric feedback mechanisms, is part of the cybernetic spells that underpin present day software production.\n\nWe respond by cargo cult programming \nwe name the actors, we reject the hierarchies of knowledge, deflect erasures, \nsome call this cargo-culting, we call it method, rejecting their colonial presumption that functionality is the only purpose, and expertise is the only source of knowlede misunderstanding\ncriteria for inclusion\nritual includsion of code with no real purpose, we reject optimization as the only value \nritual of shotgun debugging or deep magic\nWe question the naming of the non functional as unnecessary, we question the description of code as self-explanatory \n\n\nOur aim was to scrutinize this methodology in its many manifestations, including in \"observatories\" -- high cost infrastructures of observation troubled by colonial, imperial, empirical traditions and their problematic divisions of nature and culture. And through scrutiny, we hope to open up a set of questions about who gets to observe software (and how) and who is being observed by software (and with what impact)? It is a question of power, one that we answer, at least in part, with critical play. But also with slow pedagogy.\n\n\n\n\ngold:\n\nTogether we picked up the word \"observation\", turning it over and around. We are here to help you get a better look, holding all of the stories of people looking for people in mind, holding terminals and keyboards in hand. We see how to approach the software, how to organize and engage with its implications. Observation, and the enabling of it through intensive data-centric feedback mechanisms, is part of the cybernetic principles that underpin present day software production.\n\n\nWe are techno-galactic as we meet the contemporary paradigms of computation that proudly announce their capability for \"scaling up to the universe.\" We stand here as modest witnesses to the scales of software communities and related political economies that involve and require observation.\n\nThis guide offers a set of practical and fantastical tools for the tactical (mis)use of software, empowering/enabling users to resist embedded paradigms and assumptions. It is a collection of methods for approaching software, experiencing its myths and realities, its risks and benefits. Drawing on theories of software and computation developed in academia and elsewhere, we grounded our methods in hands-on exercises and experiments that you now can try at home. This Guide to Techno-Galactic Software Observation offers methods developed in and inspired by the context of software production, hacker culture, software studies, computer science research, Free Software communities, privacy activism, and artistic practice. It invites you to experiment with ways to stay with the trouble of software. Come join us at the edge of the universe, on the metro platform, at your kitchen table, as we mark and measure critical distances from and entanglements with the seemingly endless software systems that surround us.\n\nThe techno-galactic software survival guide was collectively produced as an outcome of the Techno-Galactic Software Observatory. \n[This feels like it could be in a different font size or in brackets or is the start of the next page/spread?]\n\n\nRemaining thoughts/notes for inspiration:\nYou may want to just throw all your devices away, but before you do so, wouldn't you want to, for once poke them back?\nYou may think about retreating to a wooden cabin, and live a software-free life, but even then, do you think you could manage without talking about your past software troubles.\nAnd, how about those drawings at the nearby cave, that look eerily similar to an ancient flowchart, you think you can just ignore its poetry?\n\nkostas axelos, planetary interlude, maybe some bits fit with the intro?:\n\n%  We open ourselves to abysses and we are swallowed up in sys-\n%  tems and totalizations - for these are fragments and segments of\n%  \"totality\" which establish themselves as total and/or partial totali-\n%  tarisms - without foreseeing what might be the home, the house, the\n%  habitat of living, thinking man, an unfinished, unfinishable being in a\n%  history which is equally so, neither a shell stuck fast to a rock, nor a\n%  simple nomad or vagabond. Mortals wish for the familiar and for\n%  adventure, the known and the unknown, undecided as to who decides\n%  and to what he decides, chosen rather than choosing. Since they are\n%  unable to be their own master, they allow themselves to be fixed,\n%  tossed about, carried away, scattered and put to flight, incapable of\n%  choosing - if choice there be - between success in and in relation to\n%  the world, and the World. All this does not constitute an error; wan-\n%  dering (errance) commands it. \n Galactic irony is watching us. \n%  Dream of a shadow and dispenser of light, conquistador and\n%  deserter of the World, pawn and pioneer, man sets out to conquer\n%  the stars and he ploughs the sea. The assault he launches against the\n%  astral earth and against the celestial stars is not without disaster.\n Whether he delves into analysis and disintegration -- since he needs\n analyses, concrete and tangible solutions and experimentations -- or\n whether he plunges into syntheses -- since the abstracting power and\n the ungraspable attract him equally --, as precisely and as far as he\n may cast his nets, what his nets catch and what passes through them\n communicate. Never quite awake and never quite beclouded, will we\n learn to live and to see beings and things simultaneously from close\n up and far away, large and small, in their and in our wandering\n (errance), in the great World which is at the same time small, where\n there are no victors - would there be vanquished?\n\n## The Techno-Galactic Software Observatory\n\nIn the summer of 2017, thirty or so people gathered in Brussels to explore practices of proximate critique with and of software in the context of a worksession entitled \"Techno-Galactic Software Observatory\".[^]{Worksessions are intensive transdisciplinary moments, organised twice a year by Constant. They aim to provide conditions for participants with different experiences and capabilities to temporarily link their practice and to  develop ideas, prototypes and  research projects together. For the worksessions, primarily Free, Libre and Open Source software is used and material that is available under Open Content Licenses.} The worksession called for software-curious people of all kinds to ask questions about software. The intuition behind such a call was that developing different types of engagement requires a heterogeneous group of participants with different levels of expertise,  skill and background. During three sessions that were two days each, participants collectively inspected the space-time of computation and probed the universe of hardware-software separations through excursions, exercises and conversations. They tried out various perspectives and methods to look at the larger picture of software as a concept, as a practice, and as a set of techniques.\n\nThe first two days of The Techno-Galactic Software Observatory included visits to the Musée de l'Informatique Pionnière en Belgique [^]{http://www.nam-ip.be} in Namur and the Computermuseum KULeuven[^]{http://etwie.be/database/actor/computermuseum-ku-leuven}. Surrounded by these collections of historical ’numerical artefacts’, we started considering software in a long-term context (% CARLINSAYS: Do we mean a long historical context or longue duree or something else?). The museum visits provided an occasion to reflect on the conditions of software's appearance (% CARLINSAYS: appearances?) and to take on current-day questions from a genealogical perspective. What is software? How did it appear as a concept, in what industrial and governmental circumstances? What happens to the material conditions of its production (minerals, factory labor, hardware) when it evaporates into a cloud?\n\nThe second two days were spent focusing on the space-time dimension of IT development. The way computer programs and operating systems are manufactured has changed tremendously over the last seventy years, as has its production times and places. From military labs to the mega-corporation cubicles to the open-space freelancer utopia, what ruptures and continuities can be traced in the production, deployment, maintenance and destruction of software? From time-sharing to user-space partitions and containerization, what separations were and are at work? Where and when is software made today?\n\nThe last two days at the Techno-Galactic Software Observatory were dedicated to observation and its consequences. The development of software encompasses a series of practices whose evocative names are increasingly familiar: feedback, report, probe, audit, inspect, scan, diagnose, explore, test. What are the systems of knowledge and power within which these activities take place, and what other types of observation are possible? As a practical set for our investigations, we set up a walk-in clinic on the 25th floor of the World Trade Center, where users and developers could arrive with software-questions of all kinds.\n\n## The Walk-in Clinic (% CARLINSAYS: I think this title should go below the description of the walk-in clinic as the last two days of the observatory worksession and should come instead right above the invitation to the clinic so I have moved it there)\n\n> Do you suffer from the disappearance of your software into the cloud,\n> feel oppressed by unequal user privilege, or experience the torment of\n> software-ransom of any sort?\n> Bring your devices and interfaces to the World Trade Center!\n> With the help of a clear and in-depth session, at the Techno-Galactic\n> Walk-In Clinic we guarantee immediate results.\n> The  Walk-In Clinic provides free hands-on observations to software\n> curious  people of all kinds.

Software Observation\" or \"The Techno-Galactic Software Survival Guide\" or?)\n\n> I am less interested in the critical practice of reflection,\n> of showing once-again that the emperor has no

http://observatory.constantvzw.org/etherdump/friday.md.diff.html\n\n (%CARLINSAYS: Software is everywhere)\nA spectre is haunting the galaxy. It is neither revolutionary [@marx:1848:cmanifesto] nor is it a global scale vulnerability [@meltdown:2018:spectre17], but no matter where you happen to be, there is the spectre of a software running somewhere in the background. Look! There it is, looking right back at you. Be it your phone screen or a passing satellite, software's observation and entanglement in the everyday appears complete. But is it so total? Look again. (%CARLINSAYS: I think this makes more sense up here)\n\n(%CARLINSAYS: This guide is XYZ and it tickles. I wonder if this actually needs to be at the end?)\nThe Techno-Galactic Software Survival Guide  is an obsessive fantasy of optimization turned on its head, and stuck to the ceiling of a self-reflecting elevator. It is the ultimate book of dos and don'ts, of forgotten histories and un-inevitable futures, of mindful agile actions and improvisational service architectures, of any and all things that you can and cannot imagine needing in a techno-galaxy. Reading is not enough, software is not just a text, observation is one potential beginning, engagement is tickling.\n\n(%CARLINSAYS: Online services have altered software and reconfigured society)\nCan you call up that feeling of anticipation at the approach of a touch that is wanted but that cannot be born with a straight face? The concept and structure of service offers one possible first point of contact. A 1960s dream of online services was revived in the 1990s [@haigh:2001:soft60]. Since then the use of software has increasingly been knitted into the production of software, even while the rhetoric, rights and procedures continue to suggest that use and production constitute separate realms. This knitting together and its corresponding disavowal has an effect on the way software is used and produced that radically alters its operative role in society. The shifts ripple across galaxies, through social structures, working conditions and personal relations, resulting in a profusion of apparatuses aspiring to be seamless while optimizing and monetizing individual and collective flows of information in line with the interests of a handful of actors. The diffusion of software services affects the individual (%CARLINSAYS: this was \"personal\" but individual is a better pair with \"public\" we could also use \"individual person\" or other suggestions?), in the form of intensified identity shaping and self-management. It also affects the public, as more and more libraries, universities and public infrastructures as well as the management of public life rely on \"solutions\" provided by private companies. Centralizing data flows in the clouds, services blur the last traces of the thin line that separates bio- from necro-politics.\n\n(%CARLINSAYS: Maybe this gets moved up?)\nGiven how fast software resonates and reproduces, there is a growing urgency to engage with it in manners that goes beyond taking a distance, and that deal with the fact that we are inevitably already entangled. (% CARLINSAYS: repetitive?) How can we interact, respond and think with software? What approaches can we use to recognize the agency of different actors, their ways of working and their politics? What methods of observation are conducive to critical inquiry and affirmative discord? What techniques can we apply to resurface software, finding the sites where their infrastructures are reconfiguring the everyday? How can we remember that software is always at work, especially where it is designed to disappear into the background? \n\nWe pick up the word \"observation\", turning it over and around. (% CARLINSAYS: use past tense?) We look it over, holding all of the stories of people looking at others and objects in mind, holding terminals and keyboards in hand. We sync our breath to the rhythm of our software. We consid at this wholistic observation as a way to approach software, as one way to organize engagement with its implications. Observation, and the Enabling of it intensively through data-centric Feedback Mechanisms, is share of the cybernetic spell That underpins present day software production. Our aim was ??to scrutinize this methodology in its many manifestations, including in \"observatories\" - high cost infrastructures of observation troubled by colonial, imperial, empirical traditions and their problematic divisions of nature and culture. And through scrutiny, what do you think about who gets to watch software (and how) and who is being observed by software (and with what impact)? It is a question of power, one that we answer, at least in part, with critical play. But also with slow pedagogy.\n\nWe pick up the word \"observation\", turning it over and around. We bring it right up to our noses and hold it outstretched to get a better look, holding all of the histories of people looking at other people in mind, holding terminals and keyboards in hand. We sync our breath to the rhythm of our software. We propose holistic observation as a way to approach software, as one way to organize engagement with its implications. Observation, and the enabling of it through intensive data-centric feedback mechanisms, is part of the cybernetic spells that underpin present day software production.\n\nWe respond by cargo cult programming \nwe name the actors, we reject the hierarchies of knowledge, deflect erasures, \nsome call this cargo-culting, we call it method, rejecting their colonial presumption that functionality is the only purpose, and expertise is the only source of knowlede misunderstanding\ncriteria for inclusion\nritual includsion of code with no real purpose, we reject optimization as the only value \nritual of shotgun debugging or deep magic\nWe question the naming of the non functional as unnecessary, we question the description of code as self-explanatory \n\n\nOur aim was to scrutinize this methodology in its many manifestations, including in \"observatories\" -- high cost infrastructures of observation troubled by colonial, imperial, empirical traditions and their problematic divisions of nature and culture. And through scrutiny, we hope to open up a set of questions about who gets to observe software (and how) and who is being observed by software (and with what impact)? It is a question of power, one that we answer, at least in part, with critical play. But also with slow pedagogy.\n\n\n\n\ngold:\n\nTogether we picked up the word \"observation\", turning it over and around. We are here to help you get a better look, holding all of the stories of people looking for people in mind, holding terminals and keyboards in hand. We see how to approach the software, how to organize and engage with its implications. Observation, and the enabling of it through intensive data-centric feedback mechanisms, is part of the cybernetic principles that underpin present day software production.\n\n\nWe are techno-galactic as we meet the contemporary paradigms of computation that proudly announce their capability for \"scaling up to the universe.\" We stand here as modest witnesses to the scales of software communities and related political economies that involve and require observation.\n\nThis guide offers a set of practical and fantastical tools for the tactical (mis)use of software, empowering/enabling users to resist embedded paradigms and assumptions. It is a collection of methods for approaching software, experiencing its myths and realities, its risks and benefits. Drawing on theories of software and computation developed in academia and elsewhere, we grounded our methods in hands-on exercises and experiments that you now can try at home. This Guide to Techno-Galactic Software Observation offers methods developed in and inspired by the context of software production, hacker culture, software studies, computer science research, Free Software communities, privacy activism, and artistic practice. It invites you to experiment with ways to stay with the trouble of software. Come join us at the edge of the universe, on the metro platform, at your kitchen table, as we mark and measure critical distances from and entanglements with the seemingly endless software systems that surround us.\n\nThe techno-galactic software survival guide was collectively produced as an outcome of the Techno-Galactic Software Observatory. \n[This feels like it could be in a different font size or in brackets or is the start of the next page/spread?]\n\n\nRemaining thoughts/notes for inspiration:\nYou may want to just throw all your devices away, but before you do so, wouldn't you want to, for once poke them back?\nYou may think about retreating to a wooden cabin, and live a software-free life, but even then, do you think you could manage without talking about your past software troubles.\nAnd, how about those drawings at the nearby cave, that look eerily similar to an ancient flowchart, you think you can just ignore its poetry?\n\nkostas axelos, planetary interlude, maybe some bits fit with the intro?:\n\n%  We open ourselves to abysses and we are swallowed up in sys-\n%  tems and totalizations - for these are fragments and segments of\n%  \"totality\" which establish themselves as total and/or partial totali-\n%  tarisms - without foreseeing what might be the home, the house, the\n%  habitat of living, thinking man, an unfinished, unfinishable being in a\n%  history which is equally so, neither a shell stuck fast to a rock, nor a\n%  simple nomad or vagabond. Mortals wish for the familiar and for\n%  adventure, the known and the unknown, undecided as to who decides\n%  and to what he decides, chosen rather than choosing. Since they are\n%  unable to be their own master, they allow themselves to be fixed,\n%  tossed about, carried away, scattered and put to flight, incapable of\n%  choosing - if choice there be - between success in and in relation to\n%  the world, and the World. All this does not constitute an error; wan-\n%  dering (errance) commands it. \n Galactic irony is watching us. \n%  Dream of a shadow and dispenser of light, conquistador and\n%  deserter of the World, pawn and pioneer, man sets out to conquer\n%  the stars and he ploughs the sea. The assault he launches against the\n%  astral earth and against the celestial stars is not without disaster.\n Whether he delves into analysis and disintegration -- since he needs\n analyses, concrete and tangible solutions and experimentations -- or\n whether he plunges into syntheses -- since the abstracting power and\n the ungraspable attract him equally --, as precisely and as far as he\n may cast his nets, what his nets catch and what passes through them\n communicate. Never quite awake and never quite beclouded, will we\n learn to live and to see beings and things simultaneously from close\n up and far away, large and small, in their and in our wandering\n (errance), in the great World which is at the same time small, where\n there are no victors - would there be vanquished?\n\n## The Techno-Galactic Software Observatory\n\nIn the summer of 2017, thirty or so people gathered in Brussels to explore practices of proximate critique with and of software in the context of a worksession entitled \"Techno-Galactic Software Observatory\".[^]{Worksessions are intensive transdisciplinary moments, organised twice a year by Constant. They aim to provide conditions for participants with different experiences and capabilities to temporarily link their practice and to  develop ideas, prototypes and  research projects together. For the worksessions, primarily Free, Libre and Open Source software is used and material that is available under Open Content Licenses.} The worksession called for software-curious people of all kinds to ask questions about software. The intuition behind such a call was that developing different types of engagement requires a heterogeneous group of participants with different levels of expertise,  skill and background. During three sessions that were two days each, participants collectively inspected the space-time of computation and probed the universe of hardware-software separations through excursions, exercises and conversations. They tried out various perspectives and methods to look at the larger picture of software as a concept, as a practice, and as a set of techniques.\n\nThe first two days of The Techno-Galactic Software Observatory included visits to the Musée de l'Informatique Pionnière en Belgique [^]{http://www.nam-ip.be} in Namur and the Computermuseum KULeuven[^]{http://etwie.be/database/actor/computermuseum-ku-leuven}. Surrounded by these collections of historical ’numerical artefacts’, we started considering software in a long-term context (% CARLINSAYS: Do we mean a long historical context or longue duree or something else?). The museum visits provided an occasion to reflect on the conditions of software's appearance (% CARLINSAYS: appearances?) and to take on current-day questions from a genealogical perspective. What is software? How did it appear as a concept, in what industrial and governmental circumstances? What happens to the material conditions of its production (minerals, factory labor, hardware) when it evaporates into a cloud?\n\nThe second two days were spent focusing on the space-time dimension of IT development. The way computer programs and operating systems are manufactured has changed tremendously over the last seventy years, as has its production times and places. From military labs to the mega-corporation cubicles to the open-space freelancer utopia, what ruptures and continuities can be traced in the production, deployment, maintenance and destruction of software? From time-sharing to user-space partitions and containerization, what separations were and are at work? Where and when is software made today?\n\nThe last two days at the Techno-Galactic Software Observatory were dedicated to observation and its consequences. The development of software encompasses a series of practices whose evocative names are increasingly familiar: feedback, report, probe, audit, inspect, scan, diagnose, explore, test. What are the systems of knowledge and power within which these activities take place, and what other types of observation are possible? As a practical set for our investigations, we set up a walk-in clinic on the 25th floor of the World Trade Center, where users and developers could arrive with software-questions of all kinds.\n\n## The Walk-in Clinic (% CARLINSAYS: I think this title should go below the description of the walk-in clinic as the last two days of the observatory worksession and should come instead right above the invitation to the clinic so I have moved it there)\n\n> Do you suffer from the disappearance of your software into the cloud,\n> feel oppressed by unequal user privilege, or experience the torment of\n> software-ransom of any sort?\n> Bring your devices and interfaces to the World Trade Center!\n> With the help of a clear and in-depth session, at the Techno-Galactic\n> Walk-In Clinic we guarantee immediate results.\n> The  Walk-In Clinic provides free hands-on observations to software\n> curious  people of all kinds.

If they are already set to do that then maybe nix my suggestion of moving the intake form up, but if they are not then that would be one way to shift the pages to make that happen.)\n\n\n","attribs":"*0+n+1*7+3*0|2+2*7+2+2*6+1+8*6+1+6*6+1+8*6+1+8*6+1+a*6+1*7|2+2*6+2*7+1*6+53|2+2+1q*0|1+1+1s*0|1+1+1p*0|1+1+18*6|1+1|3+3s*e+1*6+11*b|1+1*6+1r*0+1*e+b*6+1f*0+1*e+n*6+7*e+1*6+1g*e+1*6+3q*e+a*6+z*e+m*6+2v*e|1+1*6|1+1*6+2q*e|1+1*6+j*e+1*6+9*e+1*6+8*e+1*6+48*e+5*6+z*e+2*6+i*e+1*6+3k*e+3*6+17*e+l*6+o*e+3*6+m*e|1+o*6|1+1*6+25*e|1+1*6+7j*e+l*6+c*e+js*6+47*e|2+an*6|1+15*6+5w*n+r*6|2+e3*9+2*6+1n*0+1*6+1*n+v*6+3r*e+1e*6+8j*6*d+6*6+dt*9|2+2*e|b+wo*e+8*e*d+3*e|5+em*6+4*9|2+3*9+25*6+97*9|1+22*6|2+2*6+n*b+e*6+13*b+5*6+1z*b+x*6|2+2z*6+p5*6*d+q*6|3+61*6*j+32*6|3+3*b+15*6|2+3c*6+10*a+c*6+l*a+1*6|1+2z*6+3x*f|4+24*0*c+2*a*c+1p*a|1+1*0*c+2*a*c+1t*a|1+1*0*c+2*a*c+1y*a|1+1*0*c+2*a*c+1w*a|1+1*0*c+2*a*c+20*a|1+1*0*c+2*a*c+21*a|1+1*0*c+2*a*c+1s*a|1+1*0*c+2*a*c+1u*a|1+1*0*c+2*a*c+1w*a|1+1*0*c+2*a*c+1u*0|1+1*0*c+2*a*c+1y*a|1+1*0*c+2*a*c+1y*a|1+1*0*c+2*a*c+1y*a|1+1*0*c+2*a*c+v*f|1+1*f*1+v*f+1*a|1+1*0+2*a+1*a*c+1m*a|1+1*0*c+2*a*c+1t*a|1+1*0*c+2*a*c+1y*a|1+1*0*c+2*a*c+1y*f|1+1*f+1g*0+1*f|1+h*f+1s*0+1*f|1+5*f+z*0+1*f|1+y*f+11*0+1*f|7+bt|1+1+17*0|1+1|1+1+t*6+6+4s*0+1+1*0+1+1*0+b3*9+m*0+1+3w*6+b+11*6+1+3c*6+9+9*6+5|2+8y+3p*0+1+1*0+m+15*0+1o+2*6+d+1v*6+b+w*6+2g+2*6+h+1*6+8*9+3+16*6+a+b*6+x|2+88+m*6+h+35*6+4+l*6+4+2*6+l+3*6+5+1h*6+2|2+95+w*6+1+8*6+1+8*6+1+6s*6+2|1+95*6|2+72|1+1*0+2*1+1x*0|1+1*0+2*1+1y*0|1+1*0+2*1+s*0|1+1*0+2*1+1o*0|1+1*0+2*1+1x*0|1+1*0+2*1+1a|1+1*0+2*1+1v*0|1+1*0+2*1+1z*0|1+1*0+2*1+1z*0|1+1*0+2*1+21*0|1+1*0+2*1+1x*0|1+1*0+2*1+1t*0|1+1*0*1+2*1+1d*0|1+1*0+2*1+10*0|1+1*0+2*1+l|1+1*0+7+16*0+1|2+2*0+2+n*0|1+1*0+2+1j*7|1+1*0+2|1+1f*7|5+6h*7+1r*0|1+1*7|2+46*0|1+1*6+cs*a|1+1*6|1+1|1+1"}}},"pad:observatory.guide.introduction:revs:3801":{"changeset":"Z:dc5>2|p=39j=80*6+2$er","meta":{"author":"a.EXnmpSWanmHBGv1u","timestamp":1520105199017}},"pad:observatory.guide.introduction:revs:3802":{"changeset":"Z:dc7<1|p=39j=85-1$","meta":{"author":"a.EXnmpSWanmHBGv1u","timestamp":1520105199946}},"pad:observatory.guide.introduction:revs:3803":{"changeset":"Z:dc6<1|p=39j=84-1$","meta":{"author":"a.EXnmpSWanmHBGv1u","timestamp":1520105200452}},"pad:observatory.guide.introduction:revs:3804":{"changeset":"Z:dc5<1|p=39j=83-1$","meta":{"author":"a.EXnmpSWanmHBGv1u","timestamp":1520105200954}},"pad:observatory.guide.introduction:revs:3805":{"changeset":"Z:dc4<1|p=39j=87-1$","meta":{"author":"a.EXnmpSWanmHBGv1u","timestamp":1520105207703}},"pad:observatory.guide.introduction:revs:3806":{"changeset":"Z:dc3<3|p=39j=84-3$","meta":{"author":"a.EXnmpSWanmHBGv1u","timestamp":1520105208200}},"pad:observatory.guide.introduction:revs:3807":{"changeset":"Z:dc0<1|p=39j=83-1$","meta":{"author":"a.EXnmpSWanmHBGv1u","timestamp":1520105208704}},"pad:observatory.guide.introduction:revs:3808":{"changeset":"Z:dbz<6|r=43o=5j-7*6+1$s","meta":{"author":"a.EXnmpSWanmHBGv1u","timestamp":1520105241956}},"pad:observatory.guide.introduction:revs:3809":{"changeset":"Z:dbt>6|r=43o=5k*6+6$ and o","meta":{"author":"a.EXnmpSWanmHBGv1u","timestamp":1520105242454}},"pad:observatory.guide.introduction:revs:381":{"changeset":"Z:7cu>1|o=3me=l*0+1$g","meta":{"author":"a.PRabeGfk5jCXUq8V","timestamp":1516186924079}},"pad:observatory.guide.introduction:revs:3810":{"changeset":"Z:dbz>3|r=43o=5q*6+3$bje","meta":{"author":"a.EXnmpSWanmHBGv1u","timestamp":1520105242959}},"pad:observatory.guide.introduction:revs:3811":{"changeset":"Z:dc2>2|r=43o=5t*6+2$ct","meta":{"author":"a.EXnmpSWanmHBGv1u","timestamp":1520105243465}},"pad:observatory.guide.introduction:revs:3812":{"changeset":"Z:dc4>1|r=43o=5v*6+1$s","meta":{"author":"a.EXnmpSWanmHBGv1u","timestamp":1520105243970}},"pad:observatory.guide.introduction:revs:3813":{"changeset":"Z:dc5<u3|p=39j-u3$","meta":{"author":"a.EXnmpSWanmHBGv1u","timestamp":1520105259185}},"pad:observatory.guide.introduction:revs:3814":{"changeset":"Z:ci2<1|o=39i|1-1$","meta":{"author":"a.EXnmpSWanmHBGv1u","timestamp":1520105260481}},"pad:observatory.guide.introduction:revs:3815":{"changeset":"Z:ci1>1|r=3q9*6|1+1$\n","meta":{"author":"a.EXnmpSWanmHBGv1u","timestamp":1520105262645}},"pad:observatory.guide.introduction:revs:3816":{"changeset":"Z:ci2>1|s=3qa*6|1+1$\n","meta":{"author":"a.EXnmpSWanmHBGv1u","timestamp":1520105263146}},"pad:observatory.guide.introduction:revs:3817":{"changeset":"Z:ci3>u3|s=3qa*6+1r*6*n+v*6+di*6*d+6*6+dt$We pick up the word \"observation\", turning it over and around.

It is neither revolutionary [@marx:1848:cmanifesto] nor is it a global scale vulnerability [@meltdown:2018:spectre17], but no matter where you happen to be, there is the spectre of a software running somewhere in the background. Look! There it is, looking right back at you. Be it your phone screen or a passing satellite, software's observation and entanglement in the everyday appears complete. But is it so total? Let's look again. (%CARLINSAYS: I think this makes more sense up here)\n\n(%CARLINSAYS: Online services have altered software and reconfigured society)\n We find ourseA 1960s dream of online services was revived in the 1990s [@haigh:2001:soft60]. Since then the use of software has increasingly been knitted into the production of software, even while the rhetoric, rights and procedures continue to suggest that use and production constitute separate realms. This knitting together and its corresponding disavowal has an effect on the way software is used and produced that radically alters its operative role in society. The shifts ripple across galaxies, through social structures, working conditions and personal relations, resulting in a profusion of apparatuses aspiring to be seamless while optimizing and monetizing individual and collective flows of information in line with the interests of a handful of actors. The diffusion of software services affects the individual (%CARLINSAYS: this was \"personal\" but individual is a better pair with \"public\" we could also use \"individual person\" or other suggestions?), in the form of intensified identity shaping and self-management. It also affects the public, as more and more libraries, universities and public infrastructures as well as the management of public life rely on \"solutions\" provided by private companies. Centralizing data flows in the clouds, services blur the last traces of the thin line that separates bio- from necro-politics.\n\n(%CARLINSAYS: Maybe this gets moved up?)\nGiven how fast software resonates and reproduces, there is a growing urgency to engage with it in manners that goes beyond taking a distance, and that deal with the fact that we are inevitably already entangled. (% CARLINSAYS: repetitive?) How can we interact, respond and think with software? What approaches can we use to recognize the agency of different actors, their ways of working and their politics? What methods of observation are conducive to critical inquiry and affirmative discord? What techniques can we apply to resurface software, finding the sites where their infrastructures are reconfiguring the everyday? How can we remember that software is always at work, especially where it is designed to disappear into the background? \n\n\n\n\n\ngold:\n\nTogether we picked up the word \"observation\", turning it over and around. We are here to help you get a better look, holding all of the stories of people looking for people in mind, holding terminals and keyboards in hand. We see how to approach the software, how to organize and engage with its implications. Observation, and the enabling of it through intensive data-centric feedback mechanisms, is part of the cybernetic principles that underpin present day software production.\n\nWe bring it right up to our noses and hold it outstretched to get a better look, holding all of the histories of people looking at others and objects in mind, holding terminals and keyboards in hand. We sync our breath to the rhythm of our software. We propose holistic observation as a way to approach software, as one way to organize engagement with its implications. Observation, and the enabling of it through intensive data-centric feedback mechanisms, is part of the cybernetic spells that underpin present day software production.\n\nWe are techno-galactic as we meet the contemporary paradigms of computation that proudly announce their capability for \"scaling up to the universe.\" We stand here as modest witnesses to the scales of software communities and related political economies that involve and require observation.\n\n(%CARLINSAYS: This guide is XYZ and it tickles. I wonder if this actually needs to be at the end?)\nThe Techno-Galactic Software Survival Guide  is an obsessive fantasy of optimization turned on its head, and stuck to the ceiling of a self-reflecting elevator.

The concept and structure of service offers one possible first point of contact.\n\nThis guide offers a set of practical and fantastical tools for the tactical (mis)use of software, empowering/enabling users to resist embedded paradigms and assumptions. It is a collection of methods for approaching software, experiencing its myths and realities, its risks and benefits. Drawing on theories of software and computation developed in academia and elsewhere, we grounded our methods in hands-on exercises and experiments that you now can try at home. This Guide to Techno-Galactic Software Observation (%CARLINSAYS: use agreed title) offers methods developed in and inspired by the context of software production, hacker culture, software studies, computer science research, Free Software communities, privacy activism, and artistic practice. It invites you to experiment with ways to stay with the trouble of software. Come join us at the edge of the universe, on the metro platform, at your kitchen table, as we mark and measure critical distances from and entanglements with the seemingly endless software systems that surround us.\n\nThe techno-galactic software survival guide (%CARLINSAYS: use agreed title) was collectively produced as an outcome of the Techno-Galactic Software Observatory. \n[This feels like it could be in a different font size or in brackets or is the start of the next page/spread?]\n\n\nRemaining thoughts/notes for inspiration:\nYou may want to just throw all your devices away, but before you do so, wouldn't you want to, for once poke them back?\nYou may think about retreating to a wooden cabin, and live a software-free life, but even then, do you think you could manage without talking about your past software troubles.\nAnd, how about those drawings at the nearby cave, that look eerily similar to an ancient flowchart, you think you can just ignore its poetry?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOur aim was ??to scrutinize this methodology in its many manifestations, including in \"observatories\" - high cost infrastructures of observation troubled by colonial, imperial, empirical traditions and their problematic divisions of nature and culture. And through scrutiny, what do you think about who gets to watch software (and how) and who is being observed by software (and with what impact)? It is a question of power, one that we answer, at least in part, with critical play.

But also with slow pedagogy.\n\nkostas axelos, planetary interlude, maybe some bits fit with the intro?:\n\n%  We open ourselves to abysses and we are swallowed up in sys-\n%  tems and totalizations - for these are fragments and segments of\n%  \"totality\" which establish themselves as total and/or partial totali-\n%  tarisms - without foreseeing what might be the home, the house, the\n%  habitat of living, thinking man, an unfinished, unfinishable being in a\n%  history which is equally so, neither a shell stuck fast to a rock, nor a\n%  simple nomad or vagabond. Mortals wish for the familiar and for\n%  adventure, the known and the unknown, undecided as to who decides\n%  and to what he decides, chosen rather than choosing. Since they are\n%  unable to be their own master, they allow themselves to be fixed,\n%  tossed about, carried away, scattered and put to flight, incapable of\n%  choosing - if choice there be - between success in and in relation to\n%  the world, and the World. All this does not constitute an error; wan-\n%  dering (errance) commands it. \n Galactic irony is watching us. \n%  Dream of a shadow and dispenser of light, conquistador and\n%  deserter of the World, pawn and pioneer, man sets out to conquer\n%  the stars and he ploughs the sea. The assault he launches against the\n%  astral earth and against the celestial stars is not without disaster.\n Whether he delves into analysis and disintegration -- since he needs\n analyses, concrete and tangible solutions and experimentations -- or\n whether he plunges into syntheses -- since the abstracting power and\n the ungraspable attract him equally --, as precisely and as far as he\n may cast his nets, what his nets catch and what passes through them\n communicate. Never quite awake and never quite beclouded, will we\n learn to live and to see beings and things simultaneously from close\n up and far away, large and small, in their and in our wandering\n (errance), in the great World which is at the same time small, where\n there are no victors - would there be vanquished?\n\n## The Techno-Galactic Software Observatory\n\nIn the summer of 2017, thirty or so people gathered in Brussels to explore practices of proximate critique with and of software in the context of a worksession entitled \"Techno-Galactic Software Observatory\".[^]{Worksessions are intensive transdisciplinary moments, organised twice a year by Constant. They aim to provide conditions for participants with different experiences and capabilities to temporarily link their practice and to  develop ideas, prototypes and  research projects together. For the worksessions, primarily Free, Libre and Open Source software is used and material that is available under Open Content Licenses.} The worksession called for software-curious people of all kinds to ask questions about software. The intuition behind such a call was that developing different types of engagement requires a heterogeneous group of participants with different levels of expertise,  skill and background. During three sessions that were two days each, participants collectively inspected the space-time of computation and probed the universe of hardware-software separations through excursions, exercises and conversations. They tried out various perspectives and methods to look at the larger picture of software as a concept, as a practice, and as a set of techniques.\n\nThe first two days of The Techno-Galactic Software Observatory included visits to the Musée de l'Informatique Pionnière en Belgique [^]{http://www.nam-ip.be} in Namur and the Computermuseum KULeuven[^]{http://etwie.be/database/actor/computermuseum-ku-leuven}. Surrounded by these collections of historical ’numerical artefacts’, we started considering software in a long-term context (% CARLINSAYS: Do we mean a long historical context or longue duree or something else?). The museum visits provided an occasion to reflect on the conditions of software's appearance (% CARLINSAYS: appearances?) and to take on current-day questions from a genealogical perspective. What is software? How did it appear as a concept, in what industrial and governmental circumstances? What happens to the material conditions of its production (minerals, factory labor, hardware) when it evaporates into a cloud?\n\nThe second two days were spent focusing on the space-time dimension of IT development. The way computer programs and operating systems are manufactured has changed tremendously over the last seventy years, as has its production times and places. From military labs to the mega-corporation cubicles to the open-space freelancer utopia, what ruptures and continuities can be traced in the production, deployment, maintenance and destruction of software? From time-sharing to user-space partitions and containerization, what separations were and are at work? Where and when is software made today?\n\nThe last two days at the Techno-Galactic Software Observatory were dedicated to observation and its consequences. The development of software encompasses a series of practices whose evocative names are increasingly familiar: feedback, report, probe, audit, inspect, scan, diagnose, explore, test. What are the systems of knowledge and power within which these activities take place, and what other types of observation are possible? As a practical set for our investigations, we set up a walk-in clinic on the 25th floor of the World Trade Center, where users and developers could arrive with software-questions of all kinds.\n\n## The Walk-in Clinic (% CARLINSAYS: I think this title should go below the description of the walk-in clinic as the last two days of the observatory worksession and should come instead right above the invitation to the clinic so I have moved it there)\n\n> Do you suffer from the disappearance of your software into the cloud,\n> feel oppressed by unequal user privilege, or experience the torment of\n> software-ransom of any sort?\n> Bring your devices and interfaces to the World Trade Center!\n> With the help of a clear and in-depth session, at the Techno-Galactic\n> Walk-In Clinic we guarantee immediate results.\n> The  Walk-In Clinic provides free hands-on observations to software\n> curious  people of all kinds.

the summer of 2017, around thirty people gathered in Brussels to explore practices of proximate critique with and of software in the context of a worksession entitled \"Techno-Galactic Software

The worksession called for software-curious people of all kinds to ask questions about software. The intuition behind such a call was that different types of engagement requires a heterogeneous group of participants with different levels of expertise,  skill and background. During three sessions of two days, participants collectively inspected the space-time of computation and probed the universe of hardware-software separations through excursions, exercises and conversations. They tried out various perspectives and methods to look at the larger picture of software as a concept, as a practice, and as a set of techniques.\n\nThe first two days of The Techno-Galactic Software Observatory included visits to the Musée de l'Informatique Pionnière en Belgique [REF:NAM-IP] in Namur and the Computermuseum KULeuven. In the surrounding of these collections of historical ’numerical artefacts’, we started viewing software in a long-term context. It offered us the occasion to reflect on the conditions of its appearance, and allowed us to take on current-day questions from a genealogical perspective. What is software? How did it appear as a concept, in what industrial and governmental circumstances? What happens to the material conditions of its production (minerals, factory labor, hardware) when it evaporates into a cloud?\n\nThe second two days we focused on the space-time dimension of IT development. The way computer programs and operating systems are manufactured changed tremendously through time, and so did its production times and places. From military labs via the mega-corporation cubicles to the open-space freelancer utopia, what ruptures and continuities can be traced in the production, deployment, maintenance and destruction of software?

This guide proposes several ways to achieve critical distance from the seemingly endless software systems that surround us. It offers practical and fantastical tools for the tactical (mis)use of software, empowering/enabling users to resist embedded paradigms and assumptions. It is a collection of methods for approaching software, experiencing its myths and realities, its risks and benefits.\n\nWith the rise of online services, the use of software has increasingly been knitted into the production of software, even while the rhetoric, rights, and procedures continue to suggest that use and production constitute separate realms. This knitting together and its corresponding disavowal have an effect on the way software is used and produced, and radically alters its operative role in society. The shifts ripple across galaxies, through social structures, working conditions and personal relations, resulting in a profusion of apparatuses aspiring to be seamless while optimizing and monetizing individual and collective flows of information in line with the interests of a handful of actors. The diffusion of software services affects the personal, in the form of intensified identity shaping and self-management. It also affects the public, as more and more libraries, universities and public infrastructures as well as the management of public life rely on \"solutions\" provided by private companies. Centralizing data flows in the clouds, services blur the last traces of the thin line that separates bio- from necro-politics.\n\nGiven how fast these changes resonate and reproduce, there is a growing urgency to engage in a critique of software that goes beyond taking a distance, and that deals with the fact that we are inevitably already entangled. How can we interact, intervene, respond and think with software? What approaches can allow us to recognize the agency of different actors, their ways of functioning and their politics? What methods of observation enable critical inquiry and affirmative discord? What techniques can we apply to resurface software where it has melted into the infrastructure and into the everyday? How can we remember that software is always at work, especially where it is designed to disappear into the background?\n\nWe adopted the term of observation for a number of reasons. We regard observation as a way to approach software, as one way to organize engagement with its implications. Observation, and the enabling of observation through intensive data-centric feedback mechanisms, is part of  the cybernetic principles that underpin present day software production. Our aim was to scrutinize this methodology in its many manifestations, including in \"observatories\" -- high cost infrastructures [testing infrastructures?] of observation troubled by colonial, imperial traditions and their problematic divisions of nature and culture -- with the hope of opening up questions about who gets to observe software (and how) and who is being observed by software (and with what impact)? It is a question of power, one that we answer, at least in part, with critical play.\n\nWe adopted the term techno-galactic to match the advertised capability of \"scaling up to the universe\" that comes in contemporary paradigms of computation, and to address different scales of software communities and related political economies that involve and require observation.\n\nDrawing on theories of software and computation developed in academia and elsewhere, we grounded our methods in hands-on exercises and experiments that you now can try at home. This Guide to Techno-Galactic Software Observation offers methods developed in and inspired by the context of software production, hacker culture, software studies, computer science research, Free Software communities, privacy activism, and artistic practice. It invites you to experiment with ways to stay with the trouble of software.\n\n% ![Techno-Galactic Software Observation team, WTC Brussels, June 2017]( http://observatory.constantvzw.org/images/friday/P1010328.JPG )\n% TODO: % SHOWASAP: tgsoimages.svg tgsoteam\n%\n\n\n## The Techno-Galactic Software Observatory\nIn the summer of 2017, around thirty people gathered in Brussels to explore practices of proximate critique with and of software in the context of a worksession entitled \"Techno-Galactic Software Observatory\".[^]{Worksessions are intensive transdisciplinary moments, organised twice a year by Constant.

Observation, and the enabling of it through intensive data-centric feedback mechanisms, is part of the cybernetic spells that underpin present day software production.\n\nWe are techno-galactic as we meet the contemporary paradigms of computation that proudly announce their capability for \"scaling up to the universe.\" We stand here as modest witnesses to the scales of software communities and related political economies that involve and require observation.\n\n(%CARLINSAYS: This guide is XYZ and it tickles. I wonder if this actually needs to be at the end?)\nThe Techno-Galactic Software Survival Guide  is an obsessive fantasy of optimization turned on its head, and stuck to the ceiling of a self-reflecting elevator. It is the ultimate book of dos and don'ts, of forgotten histories and un-inevitable futures, of mindful agile actions and improvisational service architectures, of any and all things that you can and cannot imagine needing in a techno-galaxy. Reading is not enough, software is not just a text, observation is one potential beginning, engagement is tickling.\n\nCan you call up that feeling of anticipation at the approach of a touch that is wanted but that cannot be born with a straight face? The concept and structure of service offers one possible first point of contact.\n\nThis guide offers a set of practical and fantastical tools for the tactical (mis)use of software, empowering/enabling users to resist embedded paradigms and assumptions. It is a collection of methods for approaching software, experiencing its myths and realities, its risks and benefits. Drawing on theories of software and computation developed in academia and elsewhere, we grounded our methods in hands-on exercises and experiments that you now can try at home. This Guide to Techno-Galactic Software Observation (%CARLINSAYS: use agreed title) offers methods developed in and inspired by the context of software production, hacker culture, software studies, computer science research, Free Software communities, privacy activism, and artistic practice. It invites you to experiment with ways to stay with the trouble of software. Come join us at the edge of the universe, on the metro platform, at your kitchen table, as we mark and measure critical distances from and entanglements with the seemingly endless software systems that surround us.\n\nThe techno-galactic software survival guide (%CARLINSAYS: use agreed title) was collectively produced as an outcome of the Techno-Galactic Software Observatory. \n[This feels like it could be in a different font size or in brackets or is the start of the next page/spread?]\n\n\nRemaining thoughts/notes for inspiration:\nYou may want to just throw all your devices away, but before you do so, wouldn't you want to, for once poke them back?\nYou may think about retreating to a wooden cabin, and live a software-free life, but even then, do you think you could manage without talking about your past software troubles.\nAnd, how about those drawings at the nearby cave, that look eerily similar to an ancient flowchart, you think you can just ignore its poetry?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOur aim was ??to scrutinize this methodology in its many manifestations, including in \"observatories\" - high cost infrastructures of observation troubled by colonial, imperial, empirical traditions and their problematic divisions of nature and culture. And through scrutiny, what do you think about who gets to watch software (and how) and who is being observed by software (and with what impact)? It is a question of power, one that we answer, at least in part, with critical play. But also with slow pedagogy.\n\nWe respond by cargo cult programming \nwe name the actors, we reject the hierarchies of knowledge, deflect erasures, \nsome call this cargo-culting, we call it method, rejecting their colonial presumption that functionality is the only purpose, and expertise is the only source of knowledge misunderstanding\ncriteria for inclusion\nritual includsion of code with no real purpose, we reject optimization as the only value \nritual of shotgun debugging or deep magic\nWe question the naming of the non functional as unnecessary, we question the description of code as self-explanatory \n\n\nOur aim was to scrutinize this methodology in its many manifestations, including in \"observatories\" -- high cost infrastructures of observation troubled by colonial, imperial, empirical traditions and their problematic divisions of nature and culture. And through scrutiny, we hope to open up a set of questions about who gets to observe software (and how) and who is being observed by software (and with what impact)? It is a question of power, one that we answer, at least in part, with critical play. But also with slow pedagogy.\n\nkostas axelos, planetary interlude, maybe some bits fit with the intro?:\n\n%  We open ourselves to abysses and we are swallowed up in sys-\n%  tems and totalizations - for these are fragments and segments of\n%  \"totality\" which establish themselves as total and/or partial totali-\n%  tarisms - without foreseeing what might be the home, the house, the\n%  habitat of living, thinking man, an unfinished, unfinishable being in a\n%  history which is equally so, neither a shell stuck fast to a rock, nor a\n%  simple nomad or vagabond. Mortals wish for the familiar and for\n%  adventure, the known and the unknown, undecided as to who decides\n%  and to what he decides, chosen rather than choosing. Since they are\n%  unable to be their own master, they allow themselves to be fixed,\n%  tossed about, carried away, scattered and put to flight, incapable of\n%  choosing - if choice there be - between success in and in relation to\n%  the world, and the World. All this does not constitute an error; wan-\n%  dering (errance) commands it. \n Galactic irony is watching us. \n%  Dream of a shadow and dispenser of light, conquistador and\n%  deserter of the World, pawn and pioneer, man sets out to conquer\n%  the stars and he ploughs the sea. The assault he launches against the\n%  astral earth and against the celestial stars is not without disaster.\n Whether he delves into analysis and disintegration -- since he needs\n analyses, concrete and tangible solutions and experimentations -- or\n whether he plunges into syntheses -- since the abstracting power and\n the ungraspable attract him equally --, as precisely and as far as he\n may cast his nets, what his nets catch and what passes through them\n communicate. Never quite awake and never quite beclouded, will we\n learn to live and to see beings and things simultaneously from close\n up and far away, large and small, in their and in our wandering\n (errance), in the great World which is at the same time small, where\n there are no victors - would there be vanquished?\n\n## The Techno-Galactic Software Observatory\n\nIn the summer of 2017, thirty or so people gathered in Brussels to explore practices of proximate critique with and of software in the context of a worksession entitled \"Techno-Galactic Software Observatory\".[^]{Worksessions are intensive transdisciplinary moments, organised twice a year by Constant. They aim to provide conditions for participants with different experiences and capabilities to temporarily link their practice and to  develop ideas, prototypes and  research projects together. For the worksessions, primarily Free, Libre and Open Source software is used and material that is available under Open Content Licenses.} The worksession called for software-curious people of all kinds to ask questions about software. The intuition behind such a call was that developing different types of engagement requires a heterogeneous group of participants with different levels of expertise,  skill and background. During three sessions that were two days each, participants collectively inspected the space-time of computation and probed the universe of hardware-software separations through excursions, exercises and conversations. They tried out various perspectives and methods to look at the larger picture of software as a concept, as a practice, and as a set of techniques.\n\nThe first two days of The Techno-Galactic Software Observatory included visits to the Musée de l'Informatique Pionnière en Belgique [^]{http://www.nam-ip.be} in Namur and the Computermuseum KULeuven[^]{http://etwie.be/database/actor/computermuseum-ku-leuven}. Surrounded by these collections of historical ’numerical artefacts’, we started considering software in a long-term context (% CARLINSAYS: Do we mean a long historical context or longue duree or something else?). The museum visits provided an occasion to reflect on the conditions of software's appearance (% CARLINSAYS: appearances?) and to take on current-day questions from a genealogical perspective. What is software? How did it appear as a concept, in what industrial and governmental circumstances? What happens to the material conditions of its production (minerals, factory labor, hardware) when it evaporates into a cloud?\n\nThe second two days were spent focusing on the space-time dimension of IT development. The way computer programs and operating systems are manufactured has changed tremendously over the last seventy years, as has its production times and places. From military labs to the mega-corporation cubicles to the open-space freelancer utopia, what ruptures and continuities can be traced in the production, deployment, maintenance and destruction of software? From time-sharing to user-space partitions and containerization, what separations were and are at work? Where and when is software made today?\n\nThe last two days at the Techno-Galactic Software Observatory were dedicated to observation and its consequences. The development of software encompasses a series of practices whose evocative names are increasingly familiar: feedback, report, probe, audit, inspect, scan, diagnose, explore, test. What are the systems of knowledge and power within which these activities take place, and what other types of observation are possible? As a practical set for our investigations, we set up a walk-in clinic on the 25th floor of the World Trade Center, where users and developers could arrive with software-questions of all kinds.\n\n## The Walk-in Clinic (% CARLINSAYS: I think this title should go below the description of the walk-in clinic as the last two days of the observatory worksession and should come instead right above the invitation to the clinic so I have moved it there)\n\n> Do you suffer from the disappearance of your software into the cloud,\n> feel oppressed by unequal user privilege, or experience the torment of\n> software-ransom of any sort?\n> Bring your devices and interfaces to the World Trade Center!\n> With the help of a clear and in-depth session, at the Techno-Galactic\n> Walk-In Clinic we guarantee immediate results.\n> The  Walk-In Clinic provides free hands-on observations to software\n> curious  people of all kinds.

It also seems important to make sure that the two page list of services poster for the clinic is printed on pages that are facing each other. If they are already set to do that then maybe nix my suggestion of moving the intake form up, but if they are not then that would be one way to shift the pages to make that happen.)\n\n\n","attribs":"*0+n+1*7+3*0|2+2*7+2+2*6+1+8*6+1+6*6+1+8*6+1+8*6+1+a*6+1*7|2+2*6+2*7+1*6+5o|2+2+1q*0|1+1+1s*0|1+1+1p*0|1+1+18*6|1+1|3+3s*e+1*6+11*b|1+1*6+1r*0+1*e+b*6+1f*0+1*e+n*6+7*e+1*6+1g*e+1*6+3q*e+a*6+z*e+m*6+31*e|1+1*6|1+1*6+25*e|1+1*6+2n*e+l*6+q*e+37*6+1*e+4g*6+3*e+g*6+c*e+2k*6+1*e+7e*6+h*e+1s*6+g*e+3i*6+1*e|2+3m*6|1+15*6+5w*n+r*6|1+e2*9|2+2*e|3+3*6+4*9|2+3*9+25*6+97*9|1+22*6|3+f0*6+n*b+e*6+13*b+5*6+1z*b+x*6|7+q6*6+q1*6*d+q*6|3+6x*6*j+32*6|3+3*b+15*6|2+3c*6+10*a+c*6+l*a+1*6|1+2z*6+3x*f|1+1*6|6+6*6+8*6*d+6*6|b+u0*6+8*6*d+3*6|1+ei*f|3+23*0*c+2*a*c+1p*a|1+1*0*c+2*a*c+1t*a|1+1*0*c+2*a*c+1y*a|1+1*0*c+2*a*c+1w*a|1+1*0*c+2*a*c+20*a|1+1*0*c+2*a*c+21*a|1+1*0*c+2*a*c+1s*a|1+1*0*c+2*a*c+1u*a|1+1*0*c+2*a*c+1w*a|1+1*0*c+2*a*c+1u*0|1+1*0*c+2*a*c+1y*a|1+1*0*c+2*a*c+1y*a|1+1*0*c+2*a*c+1y*a|1+1*0*c+2*a*c+v*f|1+1*f*1+v*f+1*a|1+1*0+2*a+1*a*c+1m*a|1+1*0*c+2*a*c+1t*a|1+1*0*c+2*a*c+1y*a|1+1*0*c+2*a*c+1y*f|1+1*f+1g*0+1*f|1+h*f+1s*0+1*f|1+5*f+z*0+1*f|1+y*f+11*0+1*f|7+bt|1+1+17*0|1+1|1+1+t*6+6+4s*0+1+1*0+1+1*0+b3*9+m*0+1+3w*6+b+11*6+1+3c*6+9+9*6+5|2+8y+3p*0+1+1*0+m+15*0+1o+2*6+d+1v*6+b+w*6+2g+2*6+h+1*6+8*9+3+16*6+a+b*6+x|2+88+m*6+h+35*6+4+l*6+4+2*6+l+3*6+5+1h*6+2|2+95+w*6+1+8*6+1+8*6+1+6s*6+2|1+95*6|2+72|1+1*0+2*1+1x*0|1+1*0+2*1+1y*0|1+1*0+2*1+s*0|1+1*0+2*1+1o*0|1+1*0+2*1+1x*0|1+1*0+2*1+1a|1+1*0+2*1+1v*0|1+1*0+2*1+1z*0|1+1*0+2*1+1z*0|1+1*0+2*1+21*0|1+1*0+2*1+1x*0|1+1*0+2*1+1t*0|1+1*0*1+2*1+1d*0|1+1*0+2*1+10*0|1+1*0+2*1+l|1+1*0+7+16*0+1|2+2*0+2+n*0|1+1*0+2+1j*7|1+1*0+2|1+1f*7|5+6h*7+1r*0|1+1*7|2+46*0|1+1*6+cs*a|1+1*6|1+1|1+1"}}},"pad:observatory.guide.introduction:revs:4001":{"changeset":"Z:cse>5|h=105=so*6+5$fir

witness, 1996 from: http://observatory.constantvzw.org/etherdump/friday.md.diff.html\n\n (%CARLINSAYS: Software is everywhere)\nA spectre is haunting the galaxy. It is neither revolutionary [@marx:1848:cmanifesto] nor is it a global scale vulnerability [@meltdown:2018:spectre17], but no matter where you happen to be, there is the spectre of a software running somewhere in the background. Look! There it is, looking right back at you. Be it your phone screen or a passing satellite, software's observation and entanglement in the everyday appears complete. But is it so total? Let's look again. (%CARLINSAYS: I think this makes more sense up here)\n\n(%CARLINSAYS: Online services have radically altered software and reconfigured society. This is the why of this project.)\n We find ourselves in a universe built on a 1990s revival of a 1960s dream: software as service [@haigh:2001:soft60]. In this online universe, the use of software has increasingly been knitted into the production of software, even while the rhetoric, rights, and procedures continue to suggest that use and production constitute separate realms. This knitting together and its corresponding disavowal radically alters the operative role of software in society. The shifts ripple across galaxies, through social structures, working conditions, and personal relations, resulting in a profusion of apparatuses aspiring to be seamless while optimizing and monetizing individual and collective flows of information in line with the interests of a handful of actors. The diffusion of software services affects the individual person in the form of intensified identity shaping and self-management, and affect the public, as more and more libraries, universities and public infrastructures rely on \"solutions\" provided by private companies for the management of public life. As online services increasingly centralize data flows in the clouds, they blur the last traces of the thin line separating bio- from necro-politics.\n\n(%CARLINSAYS: This is the response to the above)\nGiven how quickly software resonates and reproduces, there is a growing urgency to engage it in manners that goes beyond taking a distance, and that deal with the fact that we are inevitably already entangled. (% CARLINSAYS: repetitive?) How can we interact, respond and think with software? What approaches can we use to recognize the agency of different actors, their ways of working and their politics? What methods of observation are conducive to critical inquiry and affirmative discord? What techniques can we apply to resurface software, finding the sites where their infrastructures are reconfiguring the everyday? How can we remember that software is always at work, especially where it is designed to disappear into the background? \n\n\n\n\n\ngold:\n\nTogether we picked up the word \"observation\", turning it over and around. We are here to help you get a better look, holding all of the stories of people looking for people in mind, holding terminals and keyboards in hand. We see how to approach the software, how to organize and engage with its implications. Observation, and the enabling of it through intensive data-centric feedback mechanisms, is part of the cybernetic principles that underpin present day software production.\n\nWe bring it right up to our noses and hold it outstretched to get a better look, holding all of the histories of people looking at others and objects in mind, holding terminals and keyboards in hand. We sync our breath to the rhythm of our software. We propose holistic observation as a way to approach software, as one way to organize engagement with its implications. Observation, and the enabling of it through intensive data-centric feedback mechanisms, is part of the cybernetic spells that underpin present day software production.\n\nWe are techno-galactic as we meet the contemporary paradigms of computation that proudly announce their capability for \"scaling up to the universe.\" We stand here as modest witnesses to the scales of software communities and related political economies that involve and require observation.\n\n(%CARLINSAYS: This guide is XYZ and it tickles. I wonder if this actually needs to be at the end?)\nThe Techno-Galactic Software Survival Guide  is an obsessive fantasy of optimization turned on its head, and stuck to the ceiling of a self-reflecting elevator. It is the ultimate book of dos and don'ts, of forgotten histories and un-inevitable futures, of mindful agile actions and improvisational service architectures, of any and all things that you can and cannot imagine needing in a techno-galaxy. Reading is not enough, software is not just a text, observation is one potential beginning, engagement is tickling.\n\nCan you call up that feeling of anticipation at the approach of a touch that is wanted but that cannot be born with a straight face? The concept and structure of service offers one possible first point of contact.\n\nThis guide offers a set of practical and fantastical tools for the tactical (mis)use of software, empowering/enabling users to resist embedded paradigms and assumptions. It is a collection of methods for approaching software, experiencing its myths and realities, its risks and benefits. Drawing on theories of software and computation developed in academia and elsewhere, we grounded our methods in hands-on exercises and experiments that you now can try at home. This Guide to Techno-Galactic Software Observation (%CARLINSAYS: use agreed title) offers methods developed in and inspired by the context of software production, hacker culture, software studies, computer science research, Free Software communities, privacy activism, and artistic practice. It invites you to experiment with ways to stay with the trouble of software. Come join us at the edge of the universe, on the metro platform, at your kitchen table, as we mark and measure critical distances from and entanglements with the seemingly endless software systems that surround us.\n\nThe techno-galactic software survival guide (%CARLINSAYS: use agreed title) was collectively produced as an outcome of the Techno-Galactic Software Observatory. \n[This feels like it could be in a different font size or in brackets or is the start of the next page/spread?]\n\n\nRemaining thoughts/notes for inspiration:\nYou may want to just throw all your devices away, but before you do so, wouldn't you want to, for once poke them back?\nYou may think about retreating to a wooden cabin, and live a software-free life, but even then, do you think you could manage without talking about your past software troubles.\nAnd, how about those drawings at the nearby cave, that look eerily similar to an ancient flowchart, you think you can just ignore its poetry?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOur aim was ??to scrutinize this methodology in its many manifestations, including in \"observatories\" - high cost infrastructures of observation troubled by colonial, imperial, empirical traditions and their problematic divisions of nature and culture. And through scrutiny, what do you think about who gets to watch software (and how) and who is being observed by software (and with what impact)? It is a question of power, one that we answer, at least in part, with critical play. But also with slow pedagogy.\n\nWe respond by cargo cult programming \nwe name the actors, we reject the hierarchies of knowledge, deflect erasures, \nsome call this cargo-culting, we call it method, rejecting their colonial presumption that functionality is the only purpose, and expertise is the only source of knowledge misunderstanding\ncriteria for inclusion\nritual includsion of code with no real purpose, we reject optimization as the only value \nritual of shotgun debugging or deep magic\nWe question the naming of the non functional as unnecessary, we question the description of code as self-explanatory \n\n\nOur aim was to scrutinize this methodology in its many manifestations, including in \"observatories\" -- high cost infrastructures of observation troubled by colonial, imperial, empirical traditions and their problematic divisions of nature and culture.

It is a question of power, one that we answer, at least in part, with critical play. But also with slow pedagogy.\n\nkostas axelos, planetary interlude, maybe some bits fit with the intro?:\n\n%  We open ourselves to abysses and we are swallowed up in sys-\n%  tems and totalizations - for these are fragments and segments of\n%  \"totality\" which establish themselves as total and/or partial totali-\n%  tarisms - without foreseeing what might be the home, the house, the\n%  habitat of living, thinking man, an unfinished, unfinishable being in a\n%  history which is equally so, neither a shell stuck fast to a rock, nor a\n%  simple nomad or vagabond. Mortals wish for the familiar and for\n%  adventure, the known and the unknown, undecided as to who decides\n%  and to what he decides, chosen rather than choosing. Since they are\n%  unable to be their own master, they allow themselves to be fixed,\n%  tossed about, carried away, scattered and put to flight, incapable of\n%  choosing - if choice there be - between success in and in relation to\n%  the world, and the World. All this does not constitute an error; wan-\n%  dering (errance) commands it. \n Galactic irony is watching us. \n%  Dream of a shadow and dispenser of light, conquistador and\n%  deserter of the World, pawn and pioneer, man sets out to conquer\n%  the stars and he ploughs the sea. The assault he launches against the\n%  astral earth and against the celestial stars is not without disaster.\n Whether he delves into analysis and disintegration -- since he needs\n analyses, concrete and tangible solutions and experimentations -- or\n whether he plunges into syntheses -- since the abstracting power and\n the ungraspable attract him equally --, as precisely and as far as he\n may cast his nets, what his nets catch and what passes through them\n communicate. Never quite awake and never quite beclouded, will we\n learn to live and to see beings and things simultaneously from close\n up and far away, large and small, in their and in our wandering\n (errance), in the great World which is at the same time small, where\n there are no victors - would there be vanquished?\n\n## The Techno-Galactic Software Observatory\n\nIn the summer of 2017, thirty or so people gathered in Brussels to explore practices of proximate critique with and of software in the context of a worksession entitled \"Techno-Galactic Software Observatory\".[^]{Worksessions are intensive transdisciplinary moments, organised twice a year by Constant. They aim to provide conditions for participants with different experiences and capabilities to temporarily link their practice and to  develop ideas, prototypes and  research projects together. For the worksessions, primarily Free, Libre and Open Source software is used and material that is available under Open Content Licenses.} The worksession called for software-curious people of all kinds to ask questions about software. The intuition behind such a call was that developing different types of engagement requires a heterogeneous group of participants with different levels of expertise,  skill and background. During three sessions that were two days each, participants collectively inspected the space-time of computation and probed the universe of hardware-software separations through excursions, exercises and conversations. They tried out various perspectives and methods to look at the larger picture of software as a concept, as a practice, and as a set of techniques.\n\nThe first two days of The Techno-Galactic Software Observatory included visits to the Musée de l'Informatique Pionnière en Belgique [^]{http://www.nam-ip.be} in Namur and the Computermuseum KULeuven[^]{http://etwie.be/database/actor/computermuseum-ku-leuven}. Surrounded by these collections of historical ’numerical artefacts’, we started considering software in a long-term context (% CARLINSAYS: Do we mean a long historical context or longue duree or something else?). The museum visits provided an occasion to reflect on the conditions of software's appearance (% CARLINSAYS: appearances?) and to take on current-day questions from a genealogical perspective. What is software? How did it appear as a concept, in what industrial and governmental circumstances? What happens to the material conditions of its production (minerals, factory labor, hardware) when it evaporates into a cloud?\n\nThe second two days were spent focusing on the space-time dimension of IT development. The way computer programs and operating systems are manufactured has changed tremendously over the last seventy years, as has its production times and places. From military labs to the mega-corporation cubicles to the open-space freelancer utopia, what ruptures and continuities can be traced in the production, deployment, maintenance and destruction of software? From time-sharing to user-space partitions and containerization, what separations were and are at work? Where and when is software made today?\n\nThe last two days at the Techno-Galactic Software Observatory were dedicated to observation and its consequences. The development of software encompasses a series of practices whose evocative names are increasingly familiar: feedback, report, probe, audit, inspect, scan, diagnose, explore, test. What are the systems of knowledge and power within which these activities take place, and what other types of observation are possible? As a practical set for our investigations, we set up a walk-in clinic on the 25th floor of the World Trade Center, where users and developers could arrive with software-questions of all kinds.\n\n## The Walk-in Clinic (% CARLINSAYS: I think this title should go below the description of the walk-in clinic as the last two days of the observatory worksession and should come instead right above the invitation to the clinic so I have moved it there)\n\n> Do you suffer from the disappearance of your software into the cloud,\n> feel oppressed by unequal user privilege, or experience the torment of\n> software-ransom of any sort?\n> Bring your devices and interfaces to the World Trade Center!\n> With the help of a clear and in-depth session, at the Techno-Galactic\n> Walk-In Clinic we guarantee immediate results.\n> The  Walk-In Clinic provides free hands-on observations to software\n> curious  people of all kinds. A wide range of professional and amateur \n> practitioners will provide you with Software-as-a-Critique-as-a-Service\n> on the spot. Available services range from immediate interface critique, \n> collaborative code inspection, data dowsing, various forms of network\n> analyses, unusability testing, identification of unknown viruses,\n> risk assessment, opening of black-boxes and more.\n> Free software observations provided.\n> Last intake at 16:45.\n> [^]{Invitation to the Walk-In Clinic, June 2017}\n\n% On the following pages:\n% Software as a Critique as a Service (SaaCaaS) Directory\n% and intake forms for Software Curious People (SCP)\n\n% PDF: http://observatory.constantvzw.org/documents/scprecord_FINAL.pdf 1x1 REF:scprecord\n% INFO: Intake Forms for Software Curious People (SCP)\n\n% PDF: http://observatory.constantvzw.org/documents/masterlist_twosides_NEU.pdf 2 1x1\n% INFO: Software as a Critique as a Service (SaaCaaS) Directory\n% PDF: http://observatory.constantvzw.org/documents/masterlist_twosides_NEU.pdf 1 1x1\n% INFO: Software as a Critique as a Service (SaaCaaS) Directory\n\n(% CARLINSAYS: I would suggest switching the order of these pages so the intake form is first and the list of services poster is second. It also seems important to make sure that the two page list of services poster for the clinic is printed on pages that are facing each other. If they are already set to do that then maybe nix my suggestion of moving the intake form up, but if they are not then that would be one way to shift the pages to make that happen.)\n\n\n","attribs":"*0+n+1*7+3*0|2+2*7+2+2*6+1+8*6+1+6*6+1+8*6+1+8*6+1+a*6+1*7|2+2*6+2*7+1*6+5o|2+2+1q*0|1+1+1s*0|1+1+1p*0|1+1+18*6|1+1|3+3s*e+1*6+11*b|1+1*6+1r*0+1*e+b*6+1f*0+1*e+n*6+7*e+1*6+1g*e+1*6+3q*e+a*6+z*e+m*6+31*e|1+1*6|1+1*6+3d*e|1+1*6+2n*e+l*6+q*e+37*6+1*e+4g*6+3*e+g*6+c*e+2k*6+1*e+7e*6+h*e+1s*6+g*e+3i*6+y*e+2*6+x*e+8*6+2*e+q*6+4*e+t*6+5*e+6*6+9*e|1+r*6|2+1e*6+5u*n+r*6|1+e2*9|2+2*e|3+3*6+4*9|2+3*9+25*6+97*9|1+22*6|3+f0*6+n*b+e*6+13*b+5*6+1z*b+x*6|7+q6*6+q1*6*d+q*6|3+6x*6*j+32*6|3+3*b+15*6|2+3c*6+10*a+c*6+l*a+1*6|1+2z*6+3x*f|1+1*6|6+6*6+8*6*d+6*6|b+u0*6+8*6*d+3*6|1+ei*f|3+23*0*c+2*a*c+1p*a|1+1*0*c+2*a*c+1t*a|1+1*0*c+2*a*c+1y*a|1+1*0*c+2*a*c+1w*a|1+1*0*c+2*a*c+20*a|1+1*0*c+2*a*c+21*a|1+1*0*c+2*a*c+1s*a|1+1*0*c+2*a*c+1u*a|1+1*0*c+2*a*c+1w*a|1+1*0*c+2*a*c+1u*0|1+1*0*c+2*a*c+1y*a|1+1*0*c+2*a*c+1y*a|1+1*0*c+2*a*c+1y*a|1+1*0*c+2*a*c+v*f|1+1*f*1+v*f+1*a|1+1*0+2*a+1*a*c+1m*a|1+1*0*c+2*a*c+1t*a|1+1*0*c+2*a*c+1y*a|1+1*0*c+2*a*c+1y*f|1+1*f+1g*0+1*f|1+h*f+1s*0+1*f|1+5*f+z*0+1*f|1+y*f+11*0+1*f|7+bt|1+1+17*0|1+1|1+1+t*6+6+4s*0+1+1*0+1+1*0+b3*9+m*0+1+3w*6+b+11*6+1+3c*6+9+9*6+5|2+8y+3p*0+1+1*0+m+15*0+1o+2*6+d+1v*6+b+w*6+2g+2*6+h+1*6+8*9+3+16*6+a+b*6+x|2+88+m*6+h+35*6+4+l*6+4+2*6+l+3*6+5+1h*6+2|2+95+w*6+1+8*6+1+8*6+1+6s*6+2|1+95*6|2+72|1+1*0+2*1+1x*0|1+1*0+2*1+1y*0|1+1*0+2*1+s*0|1+1*0+2*1+1o*0|1+1*0+2*1+1x*0|1+1*0+2*1+1a|1+1*0+2*1+1v*0|1+1*0+2*1+1z*0|1+1*0+2*1+1z*0|1+1*0+2*1+21*0|1+1*0+2*1+1x*0|1+1*0+2*1+1t*0|1+1*0*1+2*1+1d*0|1+1*0+2*1+10*0|1+1*0+2*1+l|1+1*0+7+16*0+1|2+2*0+2+n*0|1+1*0+2+1j*7|1+1*0+2|1+1f*7|5+6h*7+1r*0|1+1*7|2+46*0|1+1*6+cs*a|1+1*6|1+1|1+1"}}},"pad:observatory.guide.introduction:revs:4101":{"changeset":"Z:cvb<s|k=20j=5u-s$","meta":{"author":"a.EXnmpSWanmHBGv1u","timestamp":1520107681547}},"pad:observatory.guide.introduction:revs:4102":{"changeset":"Z:cuj<w|j=1z6=e-x*6+1$G","meta":{"author":"a.EXnmpSWanmHBGv1u","timestamp":1520107689857}},"pad:observatory.guide.introduction:revs:4103":{"changeset":"Z:ctn>2|j=1z6=f*6+2$iv","meta":{"author":"a.EXnmpSWanmHBGv1u","timestamp":1520107690358}},"pad:observatory.guide.introduction:revs:4104":{"changeset":"Z:ctp>1|j=1z6=h*6+1$e","meta":{"author":"a.EXnmpSWanmHBGv1u","timestamp":1520107692058}},"pad:observatory.guide.introduction:revs:4105":{"changeset":"Z:ctq>1|j=1z6=i*6+1$n","meta":{"author":"a.EXnmpSWanmHBGv1u","timestamp":1520107692555}},"pad:observatory.guide.introduction:revs:4106":{"changeset":"Z:ctr>3|j=1z6=j*6+3$

It is neither revolutionary [@marx:1848:cmanifesto] nor is it a global scale vulnerability [@meltdown:2018:spectre17], but no matter where you happen to be, there is the spectre of a software running somewhere in the background. Look! There it is, looking right back at you. Be it your phone screen or a passing satellite, software's observation and entanglement in the everyday appears complete. But is it so total? Let's look again. (%CARLINSAYS: I think this makes more sense up here but I also wonder if we want to flip on the notion of completeness so quickly?)\n\n(%CARLINSAYS: Online services have radically altered software and reconfigured society. This is the why of this project.)\n We find ourselves in a universe built on a 1990s revival of a 1960s dream: software as service [@haigh:2001:soft60]. In this online universe, the use of software has increasingly been knitted into the production of software, even while the rhetoric, rights, and procedures continue to suggest that use and production constitute separate realms. This knitting together and its corresponding disavowal radically alters the operative role of software in society. The shifts ripple across galaxies, through social structures, working conditions, and personal relations, resulting in a profusion of apparatuses aspiring to be seamless while optimizing and monetizing individual and collective flows of information in line with the interests of a handful of actors. The diffusion of software services affects the individual person in the form of intensified identity shaping and self-management, and affect the public, as more and more libraries, universities and public infrastructures rely on \"solutions\" provided by private companies for the management of public life. As online services increasingly centralize data flows in the clouds, they blur the last traces of the thin line separating bio- from necro-politics.\n\n(%CARLINSAYS: Given the state of things, these are the questions that arise...)\nGiven how quickly software resonates and reproduces, there is a growing urgency to engage it in manners that goes beyond taking a distance, and that deal with the fact that we are inevitably already entangled. How can we interact, respond to, and think with software? What approaches can we use to recognize the agency of different actors, their ways of working and their politics? What methods of observation are conducive to critical inquiry and affirmative discord? What techniques can we apply to resurface software, finding the sites where its infrastructures are reconfiguring the everyday? What methods will help us remember that software is always at work, especially where it is designed to disappear into the background? \n\n(%CARLINSAYS: This guide is XYZ and it tickles.

We are here to help you get a better look, holding all of the stories of people looking for people in mind, holding terminals and keyboards in hand. We see how to approach the software, how to organize and engage with its implications. Observation, and the enabling of it through intensive data-centric feedback mechanisms, is part of the cybernetic principles that underpin present day software production.\n\nWe bring it right up to our noses and hold it outstretched to get a better look, holding all of the histories of people looking at others and objects in mind, holding terminals and keyboards in hand. We sync our breath to the rhythm of our software. We propose holistic observation as a way to approach software, as one way to organize engagement with its implications. Observation, and the enabling of it through intensive data-centric feedback mechanisms, is part of the cybernetic spells that underpin present day software production.\n\n\n\nRemaining thoughts/notes for inspiration:\nYou may want to just throw all your devices away, but before you do so, wouldn't you want to, for once poke them back?\nYou may think about retreating to a wooden cabin, and live a software-free life, but even then, do you think you could manage without talking about your past software troubles.\nAnd, how about those drawings at the nearby cave, that look eerily similar to an ancient flowchart, you think you can just ignore its poetry?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOur aim was ??to scrutinize this methodology in its many manifestations, including in \"observatories\" - high cost infrastructures of observation troubled by colonial, imperial, empirical traditions and their problematic divisions of nature and culture. And through scrutiny, what do you think about who gets to watch software (and how) and who is being observed by software (and with what impact)? It is a question of power, one that we answer, at least in part, with critical play. But also with slow pedagogy.\n\nWe respond by cargo cult programming \nwe name the actors, we reject the hierarchies of knowledge, deflect erasures, \nsome call this cargo-culting, we call it method, rejecting their colonial presumption that functionality is the only purpose, and expertise is the only source of knowledge misunderstanding\ncriteria for inclusion\nritual includsion of code with no real purpose, we reject optimization as the only value \nritual of shotgun debugging or deep magic\nWe question the naming of the non functional as unnecessary, we question the description of code as self-explanatory \n\n\nOur aim was to scrutinize this methodology in its many manifestations, including in \"observatories\" -- high cost infrastructures of observation troubled by colonial, imperial, empirical traditions and their problematic divisions of nature and culture.

It is a question of power, one that we answer, at least in part, with critical play. But also with slow pedagogy.\n\nkostas axelos, planetary interlude, maybe some bits fit with the intro?:\n\n%  We open ourselves to abysses and we are swallowed up in sys-\n%  tems and totalizations - for these are fragments and segments of\n%  \"totality\" which establish themselves as total and/or partial totali-\n%  tarisms - without foreseeing what might be the home, the house, the\n%  habitat of living, thinking man, an unfinished, unfinishable being in a\n%  history which is equally so, neither a shell stuck fast to a rock, nor a\n%  simple nomad or vagabond. Mortals wish for the familiar and for\n%  adventure, the known and the unknown, undecided as to who decides\n%  and to what he decides, chosen rather than choosing. Since they are\n%  unable to be their own master, they allow themselves to be fixed,\n%  tossed about, carried away, scattered and put to flight, incapable of\n%  choosing - if choice there be - between success in and in relation to\n%  the world, and the World. All this does not constitute an error; wan-\n%  dering (errance) commands it. \n Galactic irony is watching us. \n%  Dream of a shadow and dispenser of light, conquistador and\n%  deserter of the World, pawn and pioneer, man sets out to conquer\n%  the stars and he ploughs the sea. The assault he launches against the\n%  astral earth and against the celestial stars is not without disaster.\n Whether he delves into analysis and disintegration -- since he needs\n analyses, concrete and tangible solutions and experimentations -- or\n whether he plunges into syntheses -- since the abstracting power and\n the ungraspable attract him equally --, as precisely and as far as he\n may cast his nets, what his nets catch and what passes through them\n communicate. Never quite awake and never quite beclouded, will we\n learn to live and to see beings and things simultaneously from close\n up and far away, large and small, in their and in our wandering\n (errance), in the great World which is at the same time small, where\n there are no victors - would there be vanquished?\n\n## The Techno-Galactic Software Observatory\n\nIn the summer of 2017, thirty or so people gathered in Brussels to explore practices of proximate critique with and of software in the context of a worksession entitled \"Techno-Galactic Software Observatory\".[^]{Worksessions are intensive transdisciplinary moments, organised twice a year by Constant. They aim to provide conditions for participants with different experiences and capabilities to temporarily link their practice and to  develop ideas, prototypes and  research projects together. For the worksessions, primarily Free, Libre and Open Source software is used and material that is available under Open Content Licenses.} The worksession called for software-curious people of all kinds to ask questions about software. The intuition behind such a call was that developing different types of engagement requires a heterogeneous group of participants with different levels of expertise,  skill and background. During three sessions that were two days each, participants collectively inspected the space-time of computation and probed the universe of hardware-software separations through excursions, exercises and conversations. They tried out various perspectives and methods to look at the larger picture of software as a concept, as a practice, and as a set of techniques.\n\nThe first two days of The Techno-Galactic Software Observatory included visits to the Musée de l'Informatique Pionnière en Belgique [^]{http://www.nam-ip.be} in Namur and the Computermuseum KULeuven[^]{http://etwie.be/database/actor/computermuseum-ku-leuven}. Surrounded by these collections of historical ’numerical artefacts’, we started considering software in a long-term context (% CARLINSAYS: Do we mean a long historical context or longue duree or something else?). The museum visits provided an occasion to reflect on the conditions of software's appearance (% CARLINSAYS: appearances?) and to take on current-day questions from a genealogical perspective. What is software? How did it appear as a concept, in what industrial and governmental circumstances? What happens to the material conditions of its production (minerals, factory labor, hardware) when it evaporates into a cloud?\n\nThe second two days were spent focusing on the space-time dimension of IT development. The way computer programs and operating systems are manufactured has changed tremendously over the last seventy years, as has its production times and places. From military labs to the mega-corporation cubicles to the open-space freelancer utopia, what ruptures and continuities can be traced in the production, deployment, maintenance and destruction of software? From time-sharing to user-space partitions and containerization, what separations were and are at work? Where and when is software made today?\n\nThe last two days at the Techno-Galactic Software Observatory were dedicated to observation and its consequences. The development of software encompasses a series of practices whose evocative names are increasingly familiar: feedback, report, probe, audit, inspect, scan, diagnose, explore, test. What are the systems of knowledge and power within which these activities take place, and what other types of observation are possible? As a practical set for our investigations, we set up a walk-in clinic on the 25th floor of the World Trade Center, where users and developers could arrive with software-questions of all kinds.\n\n## The Walk-in Clinic (% CARLINSAYS: I think this title should go below the description of the walk-in clinic as the last two days of the observatory worksession and should come instead right above the invitation to the clinic so I have moved it there)\n\n> Do you suffer from the disappearance of your software into the cloud,\n> feel oppressed by unequal user privilege, or experience the torment of\n> software-ransom of any sort?\n> Bring your devices and interfaces to the World Trade Center!\n> With the help of a clear and in-depth session, at the Techno-Galactic\n> Walk-In Clinic we guarantee immediate results.\n> The  Walk-In Clinic provides free hands-on observations to software\n> curious  people of all kinds.

It is neither revolutionary [@marx:1848:cmanifesto] nor is it a global scale vulnerability [@meltdown:2018:spectre17], but no matter where you happen to be, there is the spectre of a software running somewhere in the background. Look! There it is, looking right back at you. Be it your phone screen or a passing satellite, software's observation and entanglement in the everyday appears complete. But is it so total? Let's look again. (%CARLINSAYS: I think this makes more sense up here but I also wonder if we want to flip on the notion of completeness so quickly?)\n\n(%CARLINSAYS: Online services have radically altered software and reconfigured society. This is the why of this project.)\n We find ourselves in a universe built on a 1990s revival of a 1960s dream: software as service [@haigh:2001:soft60]. In this online universe, the use of software has increasingly been knitted into the production of software, even while the rhetoric, rights, and procedures continue to suggest that use and production constitute separate realms. This knitting together and its corresponding disavowal radically alters the operative role of software in society. The shifts ripple across galaxies, through social structures, working conditions, and personal relations, resulting in a profusion of apparatuses aspiring to be seamless while optimizing and monetizing individual and collective flows of information in line with the interests of a handful of actors. The diffusion of software services affects the individual person in the form of intensified identity shaping and self-management, and affect the public, as more and more libraries, universities and public infrastructures rely on \"solutions\" provided by private companies for the management of public life. As online services increasingly centralize data flows in the clouds, they blur the last traces of the thin line separating bio- from necro-politics.\n\n(%CARLINSAYS: Given the state of things, these are the questions that arise...)\nGiven how quickly software resonates and reproduces, there is a growing urgency to engage it in manners that goes beyond taking a distance, and that deal with the fact that we are inevitably already entangled. How can we interact, respond to, and think with software? What approaches can we use to recognize the agency of different actors, their ways of working and their politics? What methods of observation are conducive to critical inquiry and affirmative discord? What techniques can we apply to resurface software, finding the sites where its infrastructures are reconfiguring the everyday? What methods will help us remember that software is always at work, especially where it is designed to disappear into the background? \n\n(%CARLINSAYS: This guide is one answer to these questions, and it tickles.)\nThe Techno-Galactic Software Survival Guide  is an obsessive fantasy of optimization turned on its head, and stuck to the ceiling of a self-reflecting elevator. It is the ultimate book of dos and don'ts, of forgotten histories and un-inevitable futures, of mindful agile actions and improvisational service architectures, of any and all things that you can and cannot imagine needing in a techno-galaxy. Reading is not enough, software is not just a text, observation is one potential beginning, engagement is tickling. (%CARLINSAYS: I kind of want to draw this idea of tickling out more. Something like: Can you call up that feeling of eagerly anticipating a touch that is wanted but that cannot be born with a straight face? \n\nThis guide offers a set of practical and fantastical tools for the tactical (mis)use of software, empowering/enabling users to resist embedded paradigms and assumptions. It is a collection of methods for approaching software, experiencing its myths and realities, its risks and benefits. Drawing on theories of software and computation developed in academia and elsewhere, we grounded our methods in hands-on exercises and experiments that you now can try at home. This Guide to Techno-Galactic Software Observation (%CARLINSAYS: use agreed title) offers methods developed in and inspired by the context of software production, hacker culture, software studies, computer science research, Free Software communities, privacy activism, and artistic practice. It invites you to experiment with ways to stay with the trouble of software. Come join us at the edge of the universe, on the metro platform, at your kitchen table, as we mark and measure critical distances from and entanglements with the seemingly endless software systems that surround us.\n\n\nWe are techno-galactic as we meet the contemporary paradigms of computation that proudly announce their capability for \"scaling up to the universe.\" We stand here as modest witnesses to the scales of software communities and related political economies that involve and require observation.\n\n\nThe techno-galactic software survival guide (%CARLINSAYS: use agreed title) was collectively produced as an outcome of the Techno-Galactic Software Observatory. \n[This feels like it could be in a different font size or in brackets or is the start of the next page/spread?]\n\n\n\ngold:\n\nTogether we picked up the word \"observation\", turning it over and around. We are here to help you get a better look, holding all of the stories of people looking for people in mind, holding terminals and keyboards in hand. We see how to approach the software, how to organize and engage with its implications. Observation, and the enabling of it through intensive data-centric feedback mechanisms, is part of the cybernetic principles that underpin present day software production.\n\nWe bring it right up to our noses and hold it outstretched to get a better look, holding all of the histories of people looking at others and objects in mind, holding terminals and keyboards in hand. We sync our breath to the rhythm of our software. We propose holistic observation as a way to approach software, as one way to organize engagement with its implications. Observation, and the enabling of it through intensive data-centric feedback mechanisms, is part of the cybernetic spells that underpin present day software production.\n\n\n\nRemaining thoughts/notes for inspiration:\nYou may want to just throw all your devices away, but before you do so, wouldn't you want to, for once poke them back?\nYou may think about retreating to a wooden cabin, and live a software-free life, but even then, do you think you could manage without talking about your past software troubles.\nAnd, how about those drawings at the nearby cave, that look eerily similar to an ancient flowchart, you think you can just ignore its poetry?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOur aim was ??to scrutinize this methodology in its many manifestations, including in \"observatories\" - high cost infrastructures of observation troubled by colonial, imperial, empirical traditions and their problematic divisions of nature and culture. And through scrutiny, what do you think about who gets to watch software (and how) and who is being observed by software (and with what impact)? It is a question of power, one that we answer, at least in part, with critical play. But also with slow pedagogy.\n\nWe respond by cargo cult programming \nwe name the actors, we reject the hierarchies of knowledge, deflect erasures, \nsome call this cargo-culting, we call it method, rejecting their colonial presumption that functionality is the only purpose, and expertise is the only source of knowledge misunderstanding\ncriteria for inclusion\nritual includsion of code with no real purpose, we reject optimization as the only value \nritual of shotgun debugging or deep magic\nWe question the naming of the non functional as unnecessary, we question the description of code as self-explanatory \n\n\nOur aim was to scrutinize this methodology in its many manifestations, including in \"observatories\" -- high cost infrastructures of observation troubled by colonial, imperial, empirical traditions and their problematic divisions of nature and culture.

It is a question of power, one that we answer, at least in part, with critical play. But also with slow pedagogy.\n\nkostas axelos, planetary interlude, maybe some bits fit with the intro?:\n\n%  We open ourselves to abysses and we are swallowed up in sys-\n%  tems and totalizations - for these are fragments and segments of\n%  \"totality\" which establish themselves as total and/or partial totali-\n%  tarisms - without foreseeing what might be the home, the house, the\n%  habitat of living, thinking man, an unfinished, unfinishable being in a\n%  history which is equally so, neither a shell stuck fast to a rock, nor a\n%  simple nomad or vagabond. Mortals wish for the familiar and for\n%  adventure, the known and the unknown, undecided as to who decides\n%  and to what he decides, chosen rather than choosing. Since they are\n%  unable to be their own master, they allow themselves to be fixed,\n%  tossed about, carried away, scattered and put to flight, incapable of\n%  choosing - if choice there be - between success in and in relation to\n%  the world, and the World. All this does not constitute an error; wan-\n%  dering (errance) commands it. \n Galactic irony is watching us. \n%  Dream of a shadow and dispenser of light, conquistador and\n%  deserter of the World, pawn and pioneer, man sets out to conquer\n%  the stars and he ploughs the sea. The assault he launches against the\n%  astral earth and against the celestial stars is not without disaster.\n Whether he delves into analysis and disintegration -- since he needs\n analyses, concrete and tangible solutions and experimentations -- or\n whether he plunges into syntheses -- since the abstracting power and\n the ungraspable attract him equally --, as precisely and as far as he\n may cast his nets, what his nets catch and what passes through them\n communicate. Never quite awake and never quite beclouded, will we\n learn to live and to see beings and things simultaneously from close\n up and far away, large and small, in their and in our wandering\n (errance), in the great World which is at the same time small, where\n there are no victors - would there be vanquished?\n\n## The Techno-Galactic Software Observatory\n\nIn the summer of 2017, thirty or so people gathered in Brussels to explore practices of proximate critique with and of software in the context of a worksession entitled \"Techno-Galactic Software Observatory\".[^]{Worksessions are intensive transdisciplinary moments, organised twice a year by Constant. They aim to provide conditions for participants with different experiences and capabilities to temporarily link their practice and to  develop ideas, prototypes and  research projects together. For the worksessions, primarily Free, Libre and Open Source software is used and material that is available under Open Content Licenses.} The worksession called for software-curious people of all kinds to ask questions about software. The intuition behind such a call was that developing different types of engagement requires a heterogeneous group of participants with different levels of expertise,  skill and background. During three sessions that were two days each, participants collectively inspected the space-time of computation and probed the universe of hardware-software separations through excursions, exercises and conversations. They tried out various perspectives and methods to look at the larger picture of software as a concept, as a practice, and as a set of techniques.\n\nThe first two days of The Techno-Galactic Software Observatory included visits to the Musée de l'Informatique Pionnière en Belgique [^]{http://www.nam-ip.be} in Namur and the Computermuseum KULeuven[^]{http://etwie.be/database/actor/computermuseum-ku-leuven}. Surrounded by these collections of historical ’numerical artefacts’, we started considering software in a long-term context (% CARLINSAYS: Do we mean a long historical context or longue duree or something else?). The museum visits provided an occasion to reflect on the conditions of software's appearance (% CARLINSAYS: appearances?) and to take on current-day questions from a genealogical perspective. What is software? How did it appear as a concept, in what industrial and governmental circumstances? What happens to the material conditions of its production (minerals, factory labor, hardware) when it evaporates into a cloud?\n\nThe second two days were spent focusing on the space-time dimension of IT development. The way computer programs and operating systems are manufactured has changed tremendously over the last seventy years, as has its production times and places. From military labs to the mega-corporation cubicles to the open-space freelancer utopia, what ruptures and continuities can be traced in the production, deployment, maintenance and destruction of software? From time-sharing to user-space partitions and containerization, what separations were and are at work? Where and when is software made today?\n\nThe last two days at the Techno-Galactic Software Observatory were dedicated to observation and its consequences. The development of software encompasses a series of practices whose evocative names are increasingly familiar: feedback, report, probe, audit, inspect, scan, diagnose, explore, test. What are the systems of knowledge and power within which these activities take place, and what other types of observation are possible? As a practical set for our investigations, we set up a walk-in clinic on the 25th floor of the World Trade Center, where users and developers could arrive with software-questions of all kinds.\n\n## The Walk-in Clinic (% CARLINSAYS: I think this title should go below the description of the walk-in clinic as the last two days of the observatory worksession and should come instead right above the invitation to the clinic so I have moved it there)\n\n> Do you suffer from the disappearance of your software into the cloud,\n> feel oppressed by unequal user privilege, or experience the torment of\n> software-ransom of any sort?\n> Bring your devices and interfaces to the World Trade Center!\n> With the help of a clear and in-depth session, at the Techno-Galactic\n> Walk-In Clinic we guarantee immediate results.\n> The  Walk-In Clinic provides free hands-on observations to software\n> curious  people of all kinds.

It also seems important to make sure that the two page list of services poster for the clinic is printed on pages that are facing each other.

we picked up the word \"observation\", turning it over and around.

We see how to approach the software, how to organize and engage with its implications. Observation, and the enabling of it through intensive data-centric feedback mechanisms, is part of the cybernetic principles that underpin present day software production.\n\nWe bring it right up to our noses and hold it outstretched to get a better look, holding all of the histories of people looking at others and objects in mind, holding terminals and keyboards in hand. We sync our breath to the rhythm of our software. We propose holistic observation as a way to approach software, as one way to organize engagement with its implications.

Software Observation\" or \"The Techno-Galactic Software Survival Guide\" or some other iteration?)\n\n> I am less interested in the critical practice of reflection,\n> of showing once-again that the

witness, 1996 from: http://observatory.constantvzw.org/etherdump/friday.md.diff.html\n\n (%CARLINSAYS: Software is everywhere)\nA spectre is haunting the galaxy. It is neither revolutionary [@marx:1848:cmanifesto] nor is it a global scale vulnerability [@meltdown:2018:spectre17], but no matter where you happen to be, there is the spectre of a software running somewhere in the background. Look! There it is, looking right back at you. Be it your phone screen or a passing satellite, software's observation and entanglement in the everyday appears complete. But is it so total? Let's look again. (%CARLINSAYS: I think this makes more sense up here but I also wonder if we want to flip on the notion of completeness so quickly?)\n\n(%CARLINSAYS: Online services have radically altered software and reconfigured society. This is the why of this project.)\n We find ourselves in a universe built on a 1990s revival of a 1960s dream: software as service [@haigh:2001:soft60]. In this online universe, the use of software has increasingly been knitted into the production of software, even while the rhetoric, rights, and procedures continue to suggest that use and production constitute separate realms. This knitting together and its corresponding disavowal radically alters the operative role of software in society. The shifts ripple across galaxies, through social structures, working conditions, and personal relations, resulting in a profusion of apparatuses aspiring to be seamless while optimizing and monetizing individual and collective flows of information in line with the interests of a handful of actors. The diffusion of software services affects the individual person in the form of intensified identity shaping and self-management, and affect the public, as more and more libraries, universities and public infrastructures rely on \"solutions\" provided by private companies for the management of public life. As online services increasingly centralize data flows in the clouds, they blur the last traces of the thin line separating bio- from necro-politics.\n\n(%CARLINSAYS: Given the state of things, these are the questions that arise...)\nGiven how quickly software resonates and reproduces, there is a growing urgency to engage it in manners that goes beyond taking a distance, and that deal with the fact that we are inevitably already entangled. How can we interact, respond to, and think with software? What approaches can we use to recognize the agency of different actors, their ways of working and their politics? What methods of observation are conducive to critical inquiry and affirmative discord? What techniques can we apply to resurface software, finding the sites where its infrastructures are reconfiguring the everyday? What methods will help us remember that software is always at work, especially where it is designed to disappear into the background? What do you think about who gets to watch software (and how) and who is being observed by software (and with what impact)? \n\nIt is a question of power, one that we answer, at least in part, with critical play. But also with slow pedagogy.\n\nBowled over by these questions, we wondered if you and if we might want to just throw our devices away. But before doing that, wouldn't you want to try Together we picked up the word \"observation\", turning it over and around. We are here to help you get a better look, holding all of the stories of people looking for people in mind, holding terminals and keyboards in hand. We see how to approach the software, how to organize and engage with its implications. Observation, and the enabling of it through intensive data-centric feedback mechanisms, is part of the cybernetic principles that underpin present day software production.\n\nWe bring it right up to our noses and hold it outstretched to get a better look, holding all of the histories of people looking at others and objects in mind, holding terminals and keyboards in hand. We sync our breath to the rhythm of our software. We propose holistic observation as a way to approach software, as one way to organize engagement with its implications. Observation, and the enabling of it through intensive data-centric feedback mechanisms, is part of the cybernetic spells that underpin present day software production.\n\n\n\nRemaining thoughts/notes for inspiration:\nYou may want to just throw all your devices away, but before you do so, wouldn't you want to, for once poke them back?\nYou may think about retreating to a wooden cabin, and live a software-free life, but even then, do you think you could manage without talking about your past software troubles.\nAnd, how about those drawings at the nearby cave, that look eerily similar to an ancient flowchart, you think you can just ignore its poetry?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(%CARLINSAYS: This guide is one answer to these questions, and it tickles.)\nThe Techno-Galactic Software Survival Guide (%CARLINSAYS: use agreed title) is an obsessive fantasy of optimization turned on its head, and stuck to the ceiling of a self-reflecting elevator. It is the ultimate book of dos and don'ts, of forgotten histories and un-inevitable futures, of mindful agile actions and improvisational service architectures, of any and all things that you can and cannot imagine needing in a techno-galaxy. We are techno-galactic as we meet the contemporary paradigms of computation that proudly announce their capability for \"scaling up to the universe.\" We stand here as modest witnesses to the scales of software communities and related political economies that involve and require observation. Reading is not enough, software is not just a text, observation is one potential beginning, engagement is tickling. (%CARLINSAYS: I kind of want to draw this idea of tickling out more. Something like: Can you call up that feeling of eagerly anticipating a touch that cannot be born with a straight face?) \n\nThis guide offers a set of practical and fantastical tools for the tactical (mis)use of software, empowering/enabling users to resist embedded paradigms and assumptions. It is a collection of methods for approaching software, experiencing its myths and realities, its risks and benefits. Drawing on theories of software and computation developed in academia and elsewhere, we grounded our methods in hands-on exercises and experiments that you now can try at home. This Guide to Techno-Galactic Software Observation (%CARLINSAYS: use agreed title) offers methods developed in and inspired by the context of software production, hacker culture, software studies, computer science research, Free Software communities, privacy activism, and artistic practice. It invites you to experiment with ways to stay with the trouble of software. Come join us at the edge of the universe, on the metro platform, at your kitchen table, as we mark and measure critical distances from and entanglements with the seemingly endless software systems that surround us.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe techno-galactic software survival guide (%CARLINSAYS: use agreed title) was collectively produced as an outcome of the Techno-Galactic Software Observatory. \n[This feels like it could be in a different font size or in brackets or is the start of the next page/spread?]\n\n\n\ngold:\n\n\nWe respond by cargo cult programming \nwe name the actors, we reject the hierarchies of knowledge, deflect erasures, \nsome call this cargo-culting, we call it method, rejecting their colonial presumption that functionality is the only purpose, and expertise is the only source of knowledge misunderstanding\ncriteria for inclusion\nritual includsion of code with no real purpose, we reject optimization as the only value \nritual of shotgun debugging or deep magic\nWe question the naming of the non functional as unnecessary, we question the description of code as self-explanatory \n\n\nOur aim was to scrutinize this methodology in its many manifestations, including in \"observatories\" -- high cost infrastructures of observation troubled by colonial, imperial, empirical traditions and their problematic divisions of nature and culture. And through scrutiny, we hope to open up a set of questions about who gets to observe software (and how) and who is being observed by software (and with what impact)? It is a question of power, one that we answer, at least in part, with critical play. But also with slow pedagogy.\n\nkostas axelos, planetary interlude, maybe some bits fit with the intro?:\n\n%  We open ourselves to abysses and we are swallowed up in sys-\n%  tems and totalizations - for these are fragments and segments of\n%  \"totality\" which establish themselves as total and/or partial totali-\n%  tarisms - without foreseeing what might be the home, the house, the\n%  habitat of living, thinking man, an unfinished, unfinishable being in a\n%  history which is equally so, neither a shell stuck fast to a rock, nor a\n%  simple nomad or vagabond. Mortals wish for the familiar and for\n%  adventure, the known and the unknown, undecided as to who decides\n%  and to what he decides, chosen rather than choosing. Since they are\n%  unable to be their own master, they allow themselves to be fixed,\n%  tossed about, carried away, scattered and put to flight, incapable of\n%  choosing - if choice there be - between success in and in relation to\n%  the world, and the World. All this does not constitute an error; wan-\n%  dering (errance) commands it. \n Galactic irony is watching us. \n%  Dream of a shadow and dispenser of light, conquistador and\n%  deserter of the World, pawn and pioneer, man sets out to conquer\n%  the stars and he ploughs the sea. The assault he launches against the\n%  astral earth and against the celestial stars is not without disaster.\n Whether he delves into analysis and disintegration -- since he needs\n analyses, concrete and tangible solutions and experimentations -- or\n whether he plunges into syntheses -- since the abstracting power and\n the ungraspable attract him equally --, as precisely and as far as he\n may cast his nets, what his nets catch and what passes through them\n communicate. Never quite awake and never quite beclouded, will we\n learn to live and to see beings and things simultaneously from close\n up and far away, large and small, in their and in our wandering\n (errance), in the great World which is at the same time small, where\n there are no victors - would there be vanquished?\n\n## The Techno-Galactic Software Observatory\n\nIn the summer of 2017, thirty or so people gathered in Brussels to explore practices of proximate critique with and of software in the context of a worksession entitled \"Techno-Galactic Software Observatory\".[^]{Worksessions are intensive transdisciplinary moments, organised twice a year by Constant. They aim to provide conditions for participants with different experiences and capabilities to temporarily link their practice and to  develop ideas, prototypes and  research projects together. For the worksessions, primarily Free, Libre and Open Source software is used and material that is available under Open Content Licenses.} The worksession called for software-curious people of all kinds to ask questions about software. The intuition behind such a call was that developing different types of engagement requires a heterogeneous group of participants with different levels of expertise,  skill and background. During three sessions that were two days each, participants collectively inspected the space-time of computation and probed the universe of hardware-software separations through excursions, exercises and conversations. They tried out various perspectives and methods to look at the larger picture of software as a concept, as a practice, and as a set of techniques.\n\nThe first two days of The Techno-Galactic Software Observatory included visits to the Musée de l'Informatique Pionnière en Belgique [^]{http://www.nam-ip.be} in Namur and the Computermuseum KULeuven[^]{http://etwie.be/database/actor/computermuseum-ku-leuven}. Surrounded by these collections of historical ’numerical artefacts’, we started considering software in a long-term context (% CARLINSAYS: Do we mean a long historical context or longue duree or something else?). The museum visits provided an occasion to reflect on the conditions of software's appearance (% CARLINSAYS: appearances?) and to take on current-day questions from a genealogical perspective. What is software? How did it appear as a concept, in what industrial and governmental circumstances? What happens to the material conditions of its production (minerals, factory labor, hardware) when it evaporates into a cloud?\n\nThe second two days were spent focusing on the space-time dimension of IT development. The way computer programs and operating systems are manufactured has changed tremendously over the last seventy years, as has its production times and places. From military labs to the mega-corporation cubicles to the open-space freelancer utopia, what ruptures and continuities can be traced in the production, deployment, maintenance and destruction of software? From time-sharing to user-space partitions and containerization, what separations were and are at work? Where and when is software made today?\n\nThe last two days at the Techno-Galactic Software Observatory were dedicated to observation and its consequences. The development of software encompasses a series of practices whose evocative names are increasingly familiar: feedback, report, probe, audit, inspect, scan, diagnose, explore, test. What are the systems of knowledge and power within which these activities take place, and what other types of observation are possible? As a practical set for our investigations, we set up a walk-in clinic on the 25th floor of the World Trade Center, where users and developers could arrive with software-questions of all kinds.\n\n## The Walk-in Clinic (% CARLINSAYS: I think this title should go below the description of the walk-in clinic as the last two days of the observatory worksession and should come instead right above the invitation to the clinic so I have moved it there)\n\n> Do you suffer from the disappearance of your software into the cloud,\n> feel oppressed by unequal user privilege, or experience the torment of\n> software-ransom of any sort?\n> Bring your devices and interfaces to the World Trade Center!\n> With the help of a clear and in-depth session, at the Techno-Galactic\n> Walk-In Clinic we guarantee immediate results.\n> The  Walk-In Clinic provides free hands-on observations to software\n> curious  people of all kinds.

It also seems important to make sure that the two page list of services poster for the clinic is printed on pages that are facing each other. If they are already set to do that then maybe nix my suggestion of moving the intake form up, but if they are not then that would be one way to shift the pages to make that happen.)\n\n\n","attribs":"*0+n+1*7+3*0|2+2*7+2+2*6+1+8*6+1+6*6+1+8*6+1+8*6+1+a*6+1*7|2+2*6+2*7+1*6+5o|2+2+1q*0|1+1+1s*0|1+1+1p*0|1+1+18*6|1+1|3+3s*e+1*6+11*b|1+1*6+1r*0+1*e+b*6+1f*0+1*e+n*6+7*e+1*6+1g*e+1*6+3q*e+a*6+z*e+m*6+58*e|1+1*6|1+1*6+3d*e|1+1*6+2n*e+l*6+q*e+37*6+1*e+4g*6+3*e+g*6+c*e+2k*6+1*e+7e*6+h*e+1s*6+g*e+3i*6+y*e+2*6+x*e+8*6+2*e+q*6+4*e+t*6+5*e+6*6+9*e|1+r*6|m+23e*9|1+1*6|3+ut*6+q1*6*d+q*6+2d*9|1+1*e|2+2*6|4+4l*6*j+32*6|3+3*e|1+1*6+4*9|2+3*6|a+g6*6+8*6*d+3*6|1+ei*f|3+23*0*c+2*a*c+1p*a|1+1*0*c+2*a*c+1t*a|1+1*0*c+2*a*c+1y*a|1+1*0*c+2*a*c+1w*a|1+1*0*c+2*a*c+20*a|1+1*0*c+2*a*c+21*a|1+1*0*c+2*a*c+1s*a|1+1*0*c+2*a*c+1u*a|1+1*0*c+2*a*c+1w*a|1+1*0*c+2*a*c+1u*0|1+1*0*c+2*a*c+1y*a|1+1*0*c+2*a*c+1y*a|1+1*0*c+2*a*c+1y*a|1+1*0*c+2*a*c+v*f|1+1*f*1+v*f+1*a|1+1*0+2*a+1*a*c+1m*a|1+1*0*c+2*a*c+1t*a|1+1*0*c+2*a*c+1y*a|1+1*0*c+2*a*c+1y*f|1+1*f+1g*0+1*f|1+h*f+1s*0+1*f|1+5*f+z*0+1*f|1+y*f+11*0+1*f|7+bt|1+1+17*0|1+1|1+1+t*6+6+4s*0+1+1*0+1+1*0+b3*9+m*0+1+3w*6+b+11*6+1+3c*6+9+9*6+5|2+8y+3p*0+1+1*0+m+15*0+1o+2*6+d+1v*6+b+w*6+2g+2*6+h+1*6+8*9+3+16*6+a+b*6+x|2+88+m*6+h+35*6+4+l*6+4+2*6+l+3*6+5+1h*6+2|2+95+w*6+1+8*6+1+8*6+1+6s*6+2|1+95*6|2+72|1+1*0+2*1+1x*0|1+1*0+2*1+1y*0|1+1*0+2*1+s*0|1+1*0+2*1+1o*0|1+1*0+2*1+1x*0|1+1*0+2*1+1a|1+1*0+2*1+1v*0|1+1*0+2*1+1z*0|1+1*0+2*1+1z*0|1+1*0+2*1+21*0|1+1*0+2*1+1x*0|1+1*0+2*1+1t*0|1+1*0*1+2*1+1d*0|1+1*0+2*1+10*0|1+1*0+2*1+l|1+1*0+7+16*0+1|2+2*0+2+n*0|1+1*0+2+1j*7|1+1*0+2|1+1f*7|5+6h*7+1r*0|1+1*7|2+46*0|1+1*6+cs*a|1+1*6|1+1|1+1"}}},"pad:observatory.guide.introduction:revs:4401":{"changeset":"Z:cua>3|o=2uk=47*6+3$

Software Observation\" or \"The Techno-Galactic Software Survival Guide\" or some other iteration?)\n\n> I am less interested in the critical practice of reflection,\n> of showing once-again that the emperor has no clothes, than in\n> finding a way to diffract critical inquiry in order to make\n> difference patterns in a more worldly way.\n> [@haraway:1996:witness]\n% p429, Haraway, modest witness, 1996 from: http://observatory.constantvzw.org/etherdump/friday.md.diff.html\n\n (%CARLINSAYS: Software is everywhere)\nA spectre is haunting the galaxy. It is neither revolutionary [@marx:1848:cmanifesto] nor is it a global scale vulnerability [@meltdown:2018:spectre17], but no matter where you happen to be, there is the spectre of a software running somewhere in the background. Look! There it is, looking right back at you. Be it your phone screen or a passing satellite, software's observation and entanglement in the everyday appears complete. But is it so total? Let's look again. (%CARLINSAYS: I think this makes more sense up here but I also wonder if we want to flip on the notion of completeness so quickly?)\n\n(%CARLINSAYS: Online services have radically altered software and reconfigured society. This is the why of this project.)\n We find ourselves in a universe built on a 1990s revival of a 1960s dream: software as service [@haigh:2001:soft60]. In this online universe, the use of software has increasingly been knitted into the production of software, even while the rhetoric, rights, and procedures continue to suggest that use and production constitute separate realms. This knitting together and its corresponding disavowal radically alters the operative role of software in society. The shifts ripple across galaxies, through social structures, working conditions, and personal relations, resulting in a profusion of apparatuses aspiring to be seamless while optimizing and monetizing individual and collective flows of information in line with the interests of a handful of actors. The diffusion of software services affects the individual person in the form of intensified identity shaping and self-management, and affect the public, as more and more libraries, universities and public infrastructures rely on \"solutions\" provided by private companies for the management of public life. As online services increasingly centralize data flows in the clouds, they blur the last traces of the thin line separating bio- from necro-politics.\n\n(%CARLINSAYS: Given the state of things, these are the questions that arise...)\nGiven how quickly software resonates and reproduces, there is a growing urgency to engage it in manners that goes beyond taking a distance, and that deal with the fact that we are inevitably already entangled. How can we interact, respond to, and think with software? What approaches can we use to recognize the agency of different actors, their ways of working and their politics? What methods of observation are conducive to critical inquiry and affirmative discord? What techniques can we apply to resurface software, finding the sites where its infrastructures are reconfiguring the everyday? What methods will help us remember that software is always at work, especially where it is designed to disappear into the background? What do you think about who gets to watch software (and how) and who is being observed by software (and with what impact)? \n\nIt is a question of power, one that we answer, at least in part, with critical play. But also with slow pedagogy.\n\nBowled over by these questions, by constant pop-ups and push notifications, we briefly fantasized about throwing our devices away, retreating to a cabin in the woods, and living a software free life. But \n\nWe decided to try. Together we picked up the word \"observation\", turning it over and around. We are here to help you get a better look, holding all of the stories of people looking for people in mind, holding terminals and keyboards in hand. We see how to approach the software, how to organize and engage with its implications. Observation, and the enabling of it through intensive data-centric feedback mechanisms, is part of the cybernetic principles that underpin present day software production.\n\nWe bring it right up to our noses and hold it outstretched to get a better look, holding all of the histories of people looking at others and objects in mind, holding terminals and keyboards in hand. We sync our breath to the rhythm of our software. We propose holistic observation as a way to approach software, as one way to organize engagement with its implications. Observation, and the enabling of it through intensive data-centric feedback mechanisms, is part of the cybernetic spells that underpin present day software production.\n\n\n\nRemaining thoughts/notes for inspiration:\nYou may want to just throw all your devices away, but before you do so, wouldn't you want to, for once poke them back?\nYou may think about retreating to a wooden cabin, and live a software-free life, but even then, do you think you could manage without talking about your past software troubles.\nAnd, how about those drawings at the nearby cave, that look eerily similar to an ancient flowchart, you think you can just ignore its poetry?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(%CARLINSAYS: This guide is one answer to these questions, and it tickles.)\nThe Techno-Galactic Software Survival Guide (%CARLINSAYS: use agreed title) is an obsessive fantasy of optimization turned on its head, and stuck to the ceiling of a self-reflecting elevator. It is the ultimate book of dos and don'ts, of forgotten histories and un-inevitable futures, of mindful agile actions and improvisational service architectures, of any and all things that you can and cannot imagine needing in a techno-galaxy. We are techno-galactic as we meet the contemporary paradigms of computation that proudly announce their capability for \"scaling up to the universe.\" We stand here as modest witnesses to the scales of software communities and related political economies that involve and require observation. Reading is not enough, software is not just a text, observation is one potential beginning, engagement is tickling. (%CARLINSAYS: I kind of want to draw this idea of tickling out more. Something like: Can you call up that feeling of eagerly anticipating a touch that cannot be born with a straight face?) \n\nThis guide offers a set of practical and fantastical tools for the tactical (mis)use of software, empowering/enabling users to resist embedded paradigms and assumptions. It is a collection of methods for approaching software, experiencing its myths and realities, its risks and benefits. Drawing on theories of software and computation developed in academia and elsewhere, we grounded our methods in hands-on exercises and experiments that you now can try at home. This Guide to Techno-Galactic Software Observation (%CARLINSAYS: use agreed title) offers methods developed in and inspired by the context of software production, hacker culture, software studies, computer science research, Free Software communities, privacy activism, and artistic practice. It invites you to experiment with ways to stay with the trouble of software. Come join us at the edge of the universe, on the metro platform, at your kitchen table, as we mark and measure critical distances from and entanglements with the seemingly endless software systems that surround us.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe techno-galactic software survival guide (%CARLINSAYS: use agreed title) was collectively produced as an outcome of the Techno-Galactic Software Observatory. \n[This feels like it could be in a different font size or in brackets or is the start of the next page/spread?]\n\n\n\ngold:\n\n\nWe respond by cargo cult programming \nwe name the actors, we reject the hierarchies of knowledge, deflect erasures, \nsome call this cargo-culting, we call it method, rejecting their colonial presumption that functionality is the only purpose, and expertise is the only source of knowledge misunderstanding\ncriteria for inclusion\nritual includsion of code with no real purpose, we reject optimization as the only value \nritual of shotgun debugging or deep magic\nWe question the naming of the non functional as unnecessary, we question the description of code as self-explanatory \n\n\nOur aim was to scrutinize this methodology in its many manifestations, including in \"observatories\" -- high cost infrastructures of observation troubled by colonial, imperial, empirical traditions and their problematic divisions of nature and culture. And through scrutiny, we hope to open up a set of questions about who gets to observe software (and how) and who is being observed by software (and with what impact)? It is a question of power, one that we answer, at least in part, with critical play. But also with slow pedagogy.\n\nkostas axelos, planetary interlude, maybe some bits fit with the intro?:\n\n%  We open ourselves to abysses and we are swallowed up in sys-\n%  tems and totalizations - for these are fragments and segments of\n%  \"totality\" which establish themselves as total and/or partial totali-\n%  tarisms - without foreseeing what might be the home, the house, the\n%  habitat of living, thinking man, an unfinished, unfinishable being in a\n%  history which is equally so, neither a shell stuck fast to a rock, nor a\n%  simple nomad or vagabond. Mortals wish for the familiar and for\n%  adventure, the known and the unknown, undecided as to who decides\n%  and to what he decides, chosen rather than choosing. Since they are\n%  unable to be their own master, they allow themselves to be fixed,\n%  tossed about, carried away, scattered and put to flight, incapable of\n%  choosing - if choice there be - between success in and in relation to\n%  the world, and the World. All this does not constitute an error; wan-\n%  dering (errance) commands it. \n Galactic irony is watching us. \n%  Dream of a shadow and dispenser of light, conquistador and\n%  deserter of the World, pawn and pioneer, man sets out to conquer\n%  the stars and he ploughs the sea. The assault he launches against the\n%  astral earth and against the celestial stars is not without disaster.\n Whether he delves into analysis and disintegration -- since he needs\n analyses, concrete and tangible solutions and experimentations -- or\n whether he plunges into syntheses -- since the abstracting power and\n the ungraspable attract him equally --, as precisely and as far as he\n may cast his nets, what his nets catch and what passes through them\n communicate. Never quite awake and never quite beclouded, will we\n learn to live and to see beings and things simultaneously from close\n up and far away, large and small, in their and in our wandering\n (errance), in the great World which is at the same time small, where\n there are no victors - would there be vanquished?\n\n## The Techno-Galactic Software Observatory\n\nIn the summer of 2017, thirty or so people gathered in Brussels to explore practices of proximate critique with and of software in the context of a worksession entitled \"Techno-Galactic Software Observatory\".[^]{Worksessions are intensive transdisciplinary moments, organised twice a year by Constant. They aim to provide conditions for participants with different experiences and capabilities to temporarily link their practice and to  develop ideas, prototypes and  research projects together. For the worksessions, primarily Free, Libre and Open Source software is used and material that is available under Open Content Licenses.} The worksession called for software-curious people of all kinds to ask questions about software. The intuition behind such a call was that developing different types of engagement requires a heterogeneous group of participants with different levels of expertise,  skill and background. During three sessions that were two days each, participants collectively inspected the space-time of computation and probed the universe of hardware-software separations through excursions, exercises and conversations. They tried out various perspectives and methods to look at the larger picture of software as a concept, as a practice, and as a set of techniques.\n\nThe first two days of The Techno-Galactic Software Observatory included visits to the Musée de l'Informatique Pionnière en Belgique [^]{http://www.nam-ip.be} in Namur and the Computermuseum KULeuven[^]{http://etwie.be/database/actor/computermuseum-ku-leuven}. Surrounded by these collections of historical ’numerical artefacts’, we started considering software in a long-term context (% CARLINSAYS: Do we mean a long historical context or longue duree or something else?). The museum visits provided an occasion to reflect on the conditions of software's appearance (% CARLINSAYS: appearances?) and to take on current-day questions from a genealogical perspective. What is software? How did it appear as a concept, in what industrial and governmental circumstances? What happens to the material conditions of its production (minerals, factory labor, hardware) when it evaporates into a cloud?\n\nThe second two days were spent focusing on the space-time dimension of IT development. The way computer programs and operating systems are manufactured has changed tremendously over the last seventy years, as has its production times and places. From military labs to the mega-corporation cubicles to the open-space freelancer utopia, what ruptures and continuities can be traced in the production, deployment, maintenance and destruction of software? From time-sharing to user-space partitions and containerization, what separations were and are at work? Where and when is software made today?\n\nThe last two days at the Techno-Galactic Software Observatory were dedicated to observation and its consequences. The development of software encompasses a series of practices whose evocative names are increasingly familiar: feedback, report, probe, audit, inspect, scan, diagnose, explore, test. What are the systems of knowledge and power within which these activities take place, and what other types of observation are possible? As a practical set for our investigations, we set up a walk-in clinic on the 25th floor of the World Trade Center, where users and developers could arrive with software-questions of all kinds.\n\n## The Walk-in Clinic (% CARLINSAYS: I think this title should go below the description of the walk-in clinic as the last two days of the observatory worksession and should come instead right above the invitation to the clinic so I have moved it there)\n\n> Do you suffer from the disappearance of your software into the cloud,\n> feel oppressed by unequal user privilege, or experience the torment of\n> software-ransom of any sort?\n> Bring your devices and interfaces to the World Trade Center!\n> With the help of a clear and in-depth session, at the Techno-Galactic\n> Walk-In Clinic we guarantee immediate results.\n> The  Walk-In Clinic provides free hands-on observations to software\n> curious  people of all kinds.

It also seems important to make sure that the two page list of services poster for the clinic is printed on pages that are facing each other.

everywhere)\nA spectre is haunting the galaxy. It is neither revolutionary [@marx:1848:cmanifesto] nor is it a global scale vulnerability [@meltdown:2018:spectre17], but no matter where you happen to be, there is the spectre of a software running somewhere in the background. Look! There it is, looking right back at you. Be it your phone screen or a passing satellite, software's observation and entanglement in the everyday appears complete. But is it so total? Let's look again. (%CARLINSAYS: I think this makes more sense up here but I also wonder if we want to flip on the notion of completeness so quickly?)\n\n(%CARLINSAYS: Online services have radically altered software and reconfigured society. This is the why of this project.)\n We find ourselves in a universe built on a 1990s revival of a 1960s dream: software as service [@haigh:2001:soft60]. In this online universe, the use of software has increasingly been knitted into the production of software, even while the rhetoric, rights, and procedures continue to suggest that use and production constitute separate realms. This knitting together and its corresponding disavowal radically alters the operative role of software in society. The shifts ripple across galaxies, through social structures, working conditions, and personal relations, resulting in a profusion of apparatuses aspiring to be seamless while optimizing and monetizing individual and collective flows of information in line with the interests of a handful of actors. The diffusion of software services affects the individual person in the form of intensified identity shaping and self-management, and affect the public, as more and more libraries, universities and public infrastructures rely on \"solutions\" provided by private companies for the management of public life. As online services increasingly centralize data flows in the clouds, they blur the last traces of the thin line separating bio- from necro-politics.\n\n(%CARLINSAYS: Given the state of things, these are the questions that arise...)\nGiven how quickly software resonates and reproduces, there is a growing urgency to engage it in manners that goes beyond taking a distance, and that deal with the fact that we are inevitably already entangled. How can we interact, respond to, and think with software? What approaches can we use to recognize the agency of different actors, their ways of working and their politics? What methods of observation are conducive to critical inquiry and affirmative discord? What techniques can we apply to resurface software, finding the sites where its infrastructures are reconfiguring the everyday? What methods will help us remember that software is always at work, especially where it is designed to disappear into the background? What do you think about who gets to watch software (and how) and who is being observed by software (and with what impact)? \n\nBowled over by these questions, by constant pop-ups and push notifications, we briefly fantasized about throwing our devices away, retreating to a cabin in the woods, and living a software free life. But the fantasy wouldn't hold an image around talking about our past software troubles. Wouldn't it be better practice to at least try to poke and push back?\n\nWe decided to try. Together we picked up the word \"observation\", turning it over and around. We are here to help you get a better look, holding all of the stories of people looking for people in mind, holding terminals and keyboards in hand. We see how to approach the software, how to organize and engage with its implications. Observation, and the enabling of it through intensive data-centric feedback mechanisms, is part of the cybernetic principles that underpin present day software production.\n\nWe bring it right up to our noses and hold it outstretched to get a better look, holding all of the histories of people looking at others and objects in mind, holding terminals and keyboards in hand. We sync our breath to the rhythm of our software. We propose holistic observation as a way to approach software, as one way to organize engagement with its implications. Observation, and the enabling of it through intensive data-centric feedback mechanisms, is part of the cybernetic spells that underpin present day software production.\n\n\n\nRemaining thoughts/notes for inspiration:\nYou may want to just throw all your devices away, but before you do so, wouldn't you want to, for once poke them back?\nYou may think about retreating to a wooden cabin, and live a software-free life, but even then, do you think you could manage without talking about your past software troubles.\nAnd, how about those drawings at the nearby cave, that look eerily similar to an ancient flowchart, you think you can just ignore its poetry?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(%CARLINSAYS: This guide is one answer to these questions, and it tickles.)\nThe Techno-Galactic Software Survival Guide (%CARLINSAYS: use agreed title) is an obsessive fantasy of optimization turned on its head, and stuck to the ceiling of a self-reflecting elevator. It is the ultimate book of dos and don'ts, of forgotten histories and un-inevitable futures, of mindful agile actions and improvisational service architectures, of any and all things that you can and cannot imagine needing in a techno-galaxy. We are techno-galactic as we meet the contemporary paradigms of computation that proudly announce their capability for \"scaling up to the universe.\" We stand here as modest witnesses to the scales of software communities and related political economies that involve and require observation. Reading is not enough, software is not just a text, observation is one potential beginning, engagement is tickling. (%CARLINSAYS: I kind of want to draw this idea of tickling out more. Something like: Can you call up that feeling of eagerly anticipating a touch that cannot be born with a straight face?) \n\nThis guide offers a set of practical and fantastical tools for the tactical (mis)use of software, empowering/enabling users to resist embedded paradigms and assumptions. It is a collection of methods for approaching software, experiencing its myths and realities, its risks and benefits. Drawing on theories of software and computation developed in academia and elsewhere, we grounded our methods in hands-on exercises and experiments that you now can try at home. This Guide to Techno-Galactic Software Observation (%CARLINSAYS: use agreed title) offers methods developed in and inspired by the context of software production, hacker culture, software studies, computer science research, Free Software communities, privacy activism, and artistic practice. It invites you to experiment with ways to stay with the trouble of software. Come join us at the edge of the universe, on the metro platform, at your kitchen table, as we mark and measure critical distances from and entanglements with the seemingly endless software systems that surround us.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe techno-galactic software survival guide (%CARLINSAYS: use agreed title) was collectively produced as an outcome of the Techno-Galactic Software Observatory. \n[This feels like it could be in a different font size or in brackets or is the start of the next page/spread?]\n\n\n\ngold:\n\n\nWe respond by cargo cult programming \nwe name the actors, we reject the hierarchies of knowledge, deflect erasures, \nsome call this cargo-culting, we call it method, rejecting their colonial presumption that functionality is the only purpose, and expertise is the only source of knowledge misunderstanding\ncriteria for inclusion\nritual includsion of code with no real purpose, we reject optimization as the only value \nritual of shotgun debugging or deep magic\nWe question the naming of the non functional as unnecessary, we question the description of code as self-explanatory \n\n\nOur aim was to scrutinize this methodology in its many manifestations, including in \"observatories\" -- high cost infrastructures of observation troubled by colonial, imperial, empirical traditions and their problematic divisions of nature and culture. And through scrutiny, we hope to open up a set of questions about who gets to observe software (and how) and who is being observed by software (and with what impact)? It is a question of power, one that we answer, at least in part, with critical play. But also with slow pedagogy.\n\nkostas axelos, planetary interlude, maybe some bits fit with the intro?:\n\n%  We open ourselves to abysses and we are swallowed up in sys-\n%  tems and totalizations - for these are fragments and segments of\n%  \"totality\" which establish themselves as total and/or partial totali-\n%  tarisms - without foreseeing what might be the home, the house, the\n%  habitat of living, thinking man, an unfinished, unfinishable being in a\n%  history which is equally so, neither a shell stuck fast to a rock, nor a\n%  simple nomad or vagabond. Mortals wish for the familiar and for\n%  adventure, the known and the unknown, undecided as to who decides\n%  and to what he decides, chosen rather than choosing. Since they are\n%  unable to be their own master, they allow themselves to be fixed,\n%  tossed about, carried away, scattered and put to flight, incapable of\n%  choosing - if choice there be - between success in and in relation to\n%  the world, and the World. All this does not constitute an error; wan-\n%  dering (errance) commands it. \n Galactic irony is watching us. \n%  Dream of a shadow and dispenser of light, conquistador and\n%  deserter of the World, pawn and pioneer, man sets out to conquer\n%  the stars and he ploughs the sea. The assault he launches against the\n%  astral earth and against the celestial stars is not without disaster.\n Whether he delves into analysis and disintegration -- since he needs\n analyses, concrete and tangible solutions and experimentations -- or\n whether he plunges into syntheses -- since the abstracting power and\n the ungraspable attract him equally --, as precisely and as far as he\n may cast his nets, what his nets catch and what passes through them\n communicate. Never quite awake and never quite beclouded, will we\n learn to live and to see beings and things simultaneously from close\n up and far away, large and small, in their and in our wandering\n (errance), in the great World which is at the same time small, where\n there are no victors - would there be vanquished?\n\n## The Techno-Galactic Software Observatory\n\nIn the summer of 2017, thirty or so people gathered in Brussels to explore practices of proximate critique with and of software in the context of a worksession entitled \"Techno-Galactic Software Observatory\".[^]{Worksessions are intensive transdisciplinary moments, organised twice a year by Constant. They aim to provide conditions for participants with different experiences and capabilities to temporarily link their practice and to  develop ideas, prototypes and  research projects together. For the worksessions, primarily Free, Libre and Open Source software is used and material that is available under Open Content Licenses.} The worksession called for software-curious people of all kinds to ask questions about software. The intuition behind such a call was that developing different types of engagement requires a heterogeneous group of participants with different levels of expertise,  skill and background. During three sessions that were two days each, participants collectively inspected the space-time of computation and probed the universe of hardware-software separations through excursions, exercises and conversations. They tried out various perspectives and methods to look at the larger picture of software as a concept, as a practice, and as a set of techniques.\n\nThe first two days of The Techno-Galactic Software Observatory included visits to the Musée de l'Informatique Pionnière en Belgique [^]{http://www.nam-ip.be} in Namur and the Computermuseum KULeuven[^]{http://etwie.be/database/actor/computermuseum-ku-leuven}. Surrounded by these collections of historical ’numerical artefacts’, we started considering software in a long-term context (% CARLINSAYS: Do we mean a long historical context or longue duree or something else?). The museum visits provided an occasion to reflect on the conditions of software's appearance (% CARLINSAYS: appearances?) and to take on current-day questions from a genealogical perspective. What is software? How did it appear as a concept, in what industrial and governmental circumstances? What happens to the material conditions of its production (minerals, factory labor, hardware) when it evaporates into a cloud?\n\nThe second two days were spent focusing on the space-time dimension of IT development. The way computer programs and operating systems are manufactured has changed tremendously over the last seventy years, as has its production times and places. From military labs to the mega-corporation cubicles to the open-space freelancer utopia, what ruptures and continuities can be traced in the production, deployment, maintenance and destruction of software? From time-sharing to user-space partitions and containerization, what separations were and are at work? Where and when is software made today?\n\nThe last two days at the Techno-Galactic Software Observatory were dedicated to observation and its consequences. The development of software encompasses a series of practices whose evocative names are increasingly familiar: feedback, report, probe, audit, inspect, scan, diagnose, explore, test. What are the systems of knowledge and power within which these activities take place, and what other types of observation are possible? As a practical set for our investigations, we set up a walk-in clinic on the 25th floor of the World Trade Center, where users and developers could arrive with software-questions of all kinds.\n\n## The Walk-in Clinic (% CARLINSAYS: I think this title should go below the description of the walk-in clinic as the last two days of the observatory worksession and should come instead right above the invitation to the clinic so I have moved it there)\n\n> Do you suffer from the disappearance of your software into the cloud,\n> feel oppressed by unequal user privilege, or experience the torment of\n> software-ransom of any sort?\n> Bring your devices and interfaces to the World Trade Center!\n> With the help of a clear and in-depth session, at the Techno-Galactic\n> Walk-In Clinic we guarantee immediate results.\n> The  Walk-In Clinic provides free hands-on observations to software\n> curious  people of all kinds. A wide range of professional and amateur \n> practitioners will provide you with Software-as-a-Critique-as-a-Service\n> on the spot. Available services range from immediate interface critique, \n> collaborative code inspection, data dowsing, various forms of network\n> analyses, unusability testing, identification of unknown viruses,\n> risk assessment, opening of black-boxes and more.\n> Free software observations provided.\n> Last intake at 16:45.\n> [^]{Invitation to the Walk-In Clinic, June 2017}\n\n% On the following pages:\n% Software as a Critique as a Service (SaaCaaS) Directory\n% and intake forms for Software Curious People (SCP)\n\n% PDF: http://observatory.constantvzw.org/documents/scprecord_FINAL.pdf 1x1 REF:scprecord\n% INFO: Intake Forms for Software Curious People (SCP)\n\n% PDF: http://observatory.constantvzw.org/documents/masterlist_twosides_NEU.pdf 2 1x1\n% INFO: Software as a Critique as a Service (SaaCaaS) Directory\n% PDF: http://observatory.constantvzw.org/documents/masterlist_twosides_NEU.pdf 1 1x1\n% INFO: Software as a Critique as a Service (SaaCaaS) Directory\n\n(% CARLINSAYS: I would suggest switching the order of these pages so the intake form is first and the list of services poster is second. It also seems important to make sure that the two page list of services poster for the clinic is printed on pages that are facing each other. If they are already set to do that then maybe nix my suggestion of moving the intake form up, but if they are not then that would be one way to shift the pages to make that happen.)\n\n\n","attribs":"*0+n+1*7+3*0|2+2*7+2+2*6+1+8*6+1+6*6+1+8*6+1+8*6+1+a*6+1*7|2+2*6+2*7+1*6+5o|2+2+1q*0|1+1+1s*0|1+1+1p*0|1+1+18*6|1+1|3+3s*e+1*6+11*b|1+1*6+1r*0+1*e+b*6+1f*0+1*e+n*6+7*e+1*6+1g*e+1*6+3q*e+a*6+z*e+m*6+58*e|1+1*6|1+1*6+3d*e|1+1*6+2n*e+l*6+q*e+37*6+1*e+4g*6+3*e+g*6+c*e+2k*6+1*e+7e*6+h*e+1s*6+g*e+3i*6+y*e+2*6+x*e+8*6+2*e+q*6+4*e+t*6+5*e+6*6+9*e|1+r*6|m+26h*9|1+1*6|3+ut*6+q1*6*d+q*6+2d*9|1+1*e|2+2*6|4+4l*6*j+32*6|3+3*e|1+1*6+4*9|2+3*6|a+g6*6+8*6*d+3*6|1+ei*f|3+23*0*c+2*a*c+1p*a|1+1*0*c+2*a*c+1t*a|1+1*0*c+2*a*c+1y*a|1+1*0*c+2*a*c+1w*a|1+1*0*c+2*a*c+20*a|1+1*0*c+2*a*c+21*a|1+1*0*c+2*a*c+1s*a|1+1*0*c+2*a*c+1u*a|1+1*0*c+2*a*c+1w*a|1+1*0*c+2*a*c+1u*0|1+1*0*c+2*a*c+1y*a|1+1*0*c+2*a*c+1y*a|1+1*0*c+2*a*c+1y*a|1+1*0*c+2*a*c+v*f|1+1*f*1+v*f+1*a|1+1*0+2*a+1*a*c+1m*a|1+1*0*c+2*a*c+1t*a|1+1*0*c+2*a*c+1y*a|1+1*0*c+2*a*c+1y*f|1+1*f+1g*0+1*f|1+h*f+1s*0+1*f|1+5*f+z*0+1*f|1+y*f+11*0+1*f|7+bt|1+1+17*0|1+1|1+1+t*6+6+4s*0+1+1*0+1+1*0+b3*9+m*0+1+3w*6+b+11*6+1+3c*6+9+9*6+5|2+8y+3p*0+1+1*0+m+15*0+1o+2*6+d+1v*6+b+w*6+2g+2*6+h+1*6+8*9+3+16*6+a+b*6+x|2+88+m*6+h+35*6+4+l*6+4+2*6+l+3*6+5+1h*6+2|2+95+w*6+1+8*6+1+8*6+1+6s*6+2|1+95*6|2+72|1+1*0+2*1+1x*0|1+1*0+2*1+1y*0|1+1*0+2*1+s*0|1+1*0+2*1+1o*0|1+1*0+2*1+1x*0|1+1*0+2*1+1a|1+1*0+2*1+1v*0|1+1*0+2*1+1z*0|1+1*0+2*1+1z*0|1+1*0+2*1+21*0|1+1*0+2*1+1x*0|1+1*0+2*1+1t*0|1+1*0*1+2*1+1d*0|1+1*0+2*1+10*0|1+1*0+2*1+l|1+1*0+7+16*0+1|2+2*0+2+n*0|1+1*0+2+1j*7|1+1*0+2|1+1f*7|5+6h*7+1r*0|1+1*7|2+46*0|1+1*6+cs*a|1+1*6|1+1|1+1"}}},"pad:observatory.guide.introduction:revs:4601":{"changeset":"Z:cxd>3|m=2rd=6e*6+3$sti","meta":{"author":"a.EXnmpSWanmHBGv1u","timestamp":1520109744372}},"pad:observatory.guide.introduction:revs:4602":{"changeset":"Z:cxg>2|m=2rd=6h*6+2$ll","meta":{"author":"a.EXnmpSWanmHBGv1u","timestamp":1520109744873}},"pad:observatory.guide.introduction:revs:4603":{"changeset":"Z:cxi>1|m=2rd=6j*6+1$,","meta":{"author":"a.EXnmpSWanmHBGv1u","timestamp":1520109746086}},"pad:observatory.guide.introduction:revs:4604":{"changeset":"Z:cxj>4|m=2rd=6k*6+4$ it ","meta":{"author":"a.EXnmpSWanmHBGv1u","timestamp":1520109746596}},"pad:observatory.guide.introduction:revs:4605":{"changeset":"Z:cxn<1|m=2rd=6n-1$","meta":{"author":"a.EXnmpSWanmHBGv1u","timestamp":1520109747412}},"pad:observatory.guide.introduction:revs:4606":{"changeset":"Z:cxm<3|m=2rd=6k-3$","meta":{"author":"a.EXnmpSWanmHBGv1u","timestamp":1520109747915}},"pad:observatory.guide.introduction:revs:4607":{"changeset":"Z:cxj<1|m=2rd=6j-1$","meta":{"author":"a.EXnmpSWanmHBGv1u","timestamp":1520109748418}},"pad:observatory.guide.introduction:revs:4608":{"changeset":"Z:cxi>3|m=2rd=6j*6+3$.

Software Observation\" or \"The Techno-Galactic Software Survival Guide\" or some other iteration?)\n\n> I am less interested in the critical practice of reflection,\n> of showing once-again that the

witness, 1996 from: http://observatory.constantvzw.org/etherdump/friday.md.diff.html\n\n (%CARLINSAYS: Software is everywhere)\nA spectre is haunting the galaxy. It is neither revolutionary [@marx:1848:cmanifesto] nor is it a global scale vulnerability [@meltdown:2018:spectre17], but no matter where you happen to be, there is the spectre of a software running somewhere in the background. Look! There it is, looking right back at you. Be it your phone screen or a passing satellite, software's observation and entanglement in the everyday appears complete. But is it so total? Let's look again. (%CARLINSAYS: I think this makes more sense up here but I also wonder if we want to flip on the notion of completeness so quickly?)\n\n(%CARLINSAYS: Online services have radically altered software and reconfigured society. This is the why of this project.)\n We find ourselves in a universe built on a 1990s revival of a 1960s dream: software as service [@haigh:2001:soft60]. In this online universe, the use of software has increasingly been knitted into the production of software, even while the rhetoric, rights, and procedures continue to suggest that use and production constitute separate realms. This knitting together and its corresponding disavowal radically alters the operative role of software in society. The shifts ripple across galaxies, through social structures, working conditions, and personal relations, resulting in a profusion of apparatuses aspiring to be seamless while optimizing and monetizing individual and collective flows of information in line with the interests of a handful of actors. The diffusion of software services affects the individual person in the form of intensified identity shaping and self-management, and affect the public, as more and more libraries, universities and public infrastructures rely on \"solutions\" provided by private companies for the management of public life. As online services increasingly centralize data flows in the clouds, they blur the last traces of the thin line separating bio- from necro-politics.\n\n(%CARLINSAYS: Given the state of things, these are the questions that arise...)\nGiven how quickly software resonates and reproduces, there is a growing urgency to engage it in manners that goes beyond taking a distance, and that deal with the fact that we are inevitably already entangled. How can we interact, respond to, and think with software? What approaches can we use to recognize the agency of different actors, their ways of working and their politics? What methods of observation are conducive to critical inquiry and affirmative discord? What techniques can we apply to resurface software, finding the sites where its infrastructures are reconfiguring the everyday? What methods will help us remember that software is always at work, especially where it is designed to disappear into the background? What do you think about who gets to watch software (and how) and who is being observed by software (and with what impact)? \n\nBowled over by these questions, by constant pop-ups and push notifications, we briefly fantasized about throwing our devices away, retreating to a cabin in the woods, and living software free lives. But the fantasy wouldn't keep still. It kept transforming into a picture of endless sitting around ta about past software troubles. Wouldn't it be better practice to at least try to poke and push back?\n\nWe decided to try. Together we picked up the word \"observation\", turning it over and around. We brought it right up to our noses and held it outstretched to get a better look, holding all of the histories of people looking at others and objects in mind, holding terminals and keyboards in hand. \n\nWe are here to help you get a better look, holding all of the stories of people looking for people in mind, holding terminals and keyboards in hand. We see how to approach the software, how to organize and engage with its implications. Observation, and the enabling of it through intensive data-centric feedback mechanisms, is part of the cybernetic principles that underpin present day software production.\n\nWe sync our breath to the rhythm of our software. We propose holistic observation as a way to approach software, as one way to organize engagement with its implications. Observation, and the enabling of it through intensive data-centric feedback mechanisms, is part of the cybernetic spells that underpin present day software production.\n\n\n\nRemaining thoughts/notes for inspiration:\nYou may want to just throw all your devices away, but before you do so, wouldn't you want to, for once poke them back?\nYou may think about retreating to a wooden cabin, and live a software-free life, but even then, do you think you could manage without talking about your past software troubles.\nAnd, how about those drawings at the nearby cave, that look eerily similar to an ancient flowchart, you think you can just ignore its poetry?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(%CARLINSAYS: This guide is one answer to these questions, and it tickles.)\nThe Techno-Galactic Software Survival Guide (%CARLINSAYS: use agreed title) is an obsessive fantasy of optimization turned on its head, and stuck to the ceiling of a self-reflecting elevator. It is the ultimate book of dos and don'ts, of forgotten histories and un-inevitable futures, of mindful agile actions and improvisational service architectures, of any and all things that you can and cannot imagine needing in a techno-galaxy. We are techno-galactic as we meet the contemporary paradigms of computation that proudly announce their capability for \"scaling up to the universe.\" We stand here as modest witnesses to the scales of software communities and related political economies that involve and require observation. Reading is not enough, software is not just a text, observation is one potential beginning, engagement is tickling. (%CARLINSAYS: I kind of want to draw this idea of tickling out more. Something like: Can you call up that feeling of eagerly anticipating a touch that cannot be born with a straight face?) \n\nThis guide offers a set of practical and fantastical tools for the tactical (mis)use of software, empowering/enabling users to resist embedded paradigms and assumptions. It is a collection of methods for approaching software, experiencing its myths and realities, its risks and benefits. Drawing on theories of software and computation developed in academia and elsewhere, we grounded our methods in hands-on exercises and experiments that you now can try at home. This Guide to Techno-Galactic Software Observation (%CARLINSAYS: use agreed title) offers methods developed in and inspired by the context of software production, hacker culture, software studies, computer science research, Free Software communities, privacy activism, and artistic practice. It invites you to experiment with ways to stay with the trouble of software. Come join us at the edge of the universe, on the metro platform, at your kitchen table, as we mark and measure critical distances from and entanglements with the seemingly endless software systems that surround us.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe techno-galactic software survival guide (%CARLINSAYS: use agreed title) was collectively produced as an outcome of the Techno-Galactic Software Observatory. \n[This feels like it could be in a different font size or in brackets or is the start of the next page/spread?]\n\n\n\ngold:\n\n\nWe respond by cargo cult programming \nwe name the actors, we reject the hierarchies of knowledge, deflect erasures, \nsome call this cargo-culting, we call it method, rejecting their colonial presumption that functionality is the only purpose, and expertise is the only source of knowledge misunderstanding\ncriteria for inclusion\nritual includsion of code with no real purpose, we reject optimization as the only value \nritual of shotgun debugging or deep magic\nWe question the naming of the non functional as unnecessary, we question the description of code as self-explanatory \n\n\nOur aim was to scrutinize this methodology in its many manifestations, including in \"observatories\" -- high cost infrastructures of observation troubled by colonial, imperial, empirical traditions and their problematic divisions of nature and culture. And through scrutiny, we hope to open up a set of questions about who gets to observe software (and how) and who is being observed by software (and with what impact)? It is a question of power, one that we answer, at least in part, with critical play. But also with slow pedagogy.\n\nkostas axelos, planetary interlude, maybe some bits fit with the intro?:\n\n%  We open ourselves to abysses and we are swallowed up in sys-\n%  tems and totalizations - for these are fragments and segments of\n%  \"totality\" which establish themselves as total and/or partial totali-\n%  tarisms - without foreseeing what might be the home, the house, the\n%  habitat of living, thinking man, an unfinished, unfinishable being in a\n%  history which is equally so, neither a shell stuck fast to a rock, nor a\n%  simple nomad or vagabond. Mortals wish for the familiar and for\n%  adventure, the known and the unknown, undecided as to who decides\n%  and to what he decides, chosen rather than choosing. Since they are\n%  unable to be their own master, they allow themselves to be fixed,\n%  tossed about, carried away, scattered and put to flight, incapable of\n%  choosing - if choice there be - between success in and in relation to\n%  the world, and the World. All this does not constitute an error; wan-\n%  dering (errance) commands it. \n Galactic irony is watching us. \n%  Dream of a shadow and dispenser of light, conquistador and\n%  deserter of the World, pawn and pioneer, man sets out to conquer\n%  the stars and he ploughs the sea. The assault he launches against the\n%  astral earth and against the celestial stars is not without disaster.\n Whether he delves into analysis and disintegration -- since he needs\n analyses, concrete and tangible solutions and experimentations -- or\n whether he plunges into syntheses -- since the abstracting power and\n the ungraspable attract him equally --, as precisely and as far as he\n may cast his nets, what his nets catch and what passes through them\n communicate. Never quite awake and never quite beclouded, will we\n learn to live and to see beings and things simultaneously from close\n up and far away, large and small, in their and in our wandering\n (errance), in the great World which is at the same time small, where\n there are no victors - would there be vanquished?\n\n## The Techno-Galactic Software Observatory\n\nIn the summer of 2017, thirty or so people gathered in Brussels to explore practices of proximate critique with and of software in the context of a worksession entitled \"Techno-Galactic Software Observatory\".[^]{Worksessions are intensive transdisciplinary moments, organised twice a year by Constant. They aim to provide conditions for participants with different experiences and capabilities to temporarily link their practice and to  develop ideas, prototypes and  research projects together. For the worksessions, primarily Free, Libre and Open Source software is used and material that is available under Open Content Licenses.} The worksession called for software-curious people of all kinds to ask questions about software. The intuition behind such a call was that developing different types of engagement requires a heterogeneous group of participants with different levels of expertise,  skill and background. During three sessions that were two days each, participants collectively inspected the space-time of computation and probed the universe of hardware-software separations through excursions, exercises and conversations. They tried out various perspectives and methods to look at the larger picture of software as a concept, as a practice, and as a set of techniques.\n\nThe first two days of The Techno-Galactic Software Observatory included visits to the Musée de l'Informatique Pionnière en Belgique [^]{http://www.nam-ip.be} in Namur and the Computermuseum KULeuven[^]{http://etwie.be/database/actor/computermuseum-ku-leuven}. Surrounded by these collections of historical ’numerical artefacts’, we started considering software in a long-term context (% CARLINSAYS: Do we mean a long historical context or longue duree or something else?). The museum visits provided an occasion to reflect on the conditions of software's appearance (% CARLINSAYS: appearances?) and to take on current-day questions from a genealogical perspective. What is software? How did it appear as a concept, in what industrial and governmental circumstances? What happens to the material conditions of its production (minerals, factory labor, hardware) when it evaporates into a cloud?\n\nThe second two days were spent focusing on the space-time dimension of IT development. The way computer programs and operating systems are manufactured has changed tremendously over the last seventy years, as has its production times and places. From military labs to the mega-corporation cubicles to the open-space freelancer utopia, what ruptures and continuities can be traced in the production, deployment, maintenance and destruction of software? From time-sharing to user-space partitions and containerization, what separations were and are at work? Where and when is software made today?\n\nThe last two days at the Techno-Galactic Software Observatory were dedicated to observation and its consequences. The development of software encompasses a series of practices whose evocative names are increasingly familiar: feedback, report, probe, audit, inspect, scan, diagnose, explore, test. What are the systems of knowledge and power within which these activities take place, and what other types of observation are possible? As a practical set for our investigations, we set up a walk-in clinic on the 25th floor of the World Trade Center, where users and developers could arrive with software-questions of all kinds.\n\n## The Walk-in Clinic (% CARLINSAYS: I think this title should go below the description of the walk-in clinic as the last two days of the observatory worksession and should come instead right above the invitation to the clinic so I have moved it there)\n\n> Do you suffer from the disappearance of your software into the cloud,\n> feel oppressed by unequal user privilege, or experience the torment of\n> software-ransom of any sort?\n> Bring your devices and interfaces to the World Trade Center!\n> With the help of a clear and in-depth session, at the Techno-Galactic\n> Walk-In Clinic we guarantee immediate results.\n> The  Walk-In Clinic provides free hands-on observations to software\n> curious  people of all kinds.

It is neither revolutionary [@marx:1848:cmanifesto] nor is it a global scale vulnerability [@meltdown:2018:spectre17], but no matter where you happen to be, there is the spectre of a software running somewhere in the background. Look! There it is, looking right back at you. Be it your phone screen or a passing satellite, software's observation and entanglement in the everyday appears complete. But is it so total? Let's look again. (%CARLINSAYS: I think this makes more sense up here but I also wonder if we want to flip on the notion of completeness so quickly?)\n\n(%CARLINSAYS: Online services have radically altered software and reconfigured society. This is the why of this project.)\n We find ourselves in a universe built on a 1990s revival of a 1960s dream: software as service [@haigh:2001:soft60]. In this online universe, the use of software has increasingly been knitted into the production of software, even while the rhetoric, rights, and procedures continue to suggest that use and production constitute separate realms. This knitting together and its corresponding disavowal radically alters the operative role of software in society. The shifts ripple across galaxies, through social structures, working conditions, and personal relations, resulting in a profusion of apparatuses aspiring to be seamless while optimizing and monetizing individual and collective flows of information in line with the interests of a handful of actors. The diffusion of software services affects the individual person in the form of intensified identity shaping and self-management, and affect the public, as more and more libraries, universities and public infrastructures rely on \"solutions\" provided by private companies for the management of public life. As online services increasingly centralize data flows in the clouds, they blur the last traces of the thin line separating bio- from necro-politics.\n\n(%CARLINSAYS: Given the state of things, what do we do? There are)\nGiven how quickly software resonates and reproduces, there is a growing urgency to engage it in manners that goes beyond taking a distance, and that deal with the fact that we are inevitably already entangled. How can we interact, respond to, and think with software? What approaches can we use to recognize the agency of different actors, their ways of working and their politics? What methods of observation are conducive to critical inquiry and affirmative discord? What techniques can we apply to resurface software, finding the sites where its infrastructures are reconfiguring the everyday? What methods will help us remember that software is always at work, especially where it is designed to disappear into the background? What do you think about who gets to watch software (and how) and who is being observed by software (and with what impact)? \n\nBowled over by these questions, by constant pop-ups and push notifications, we briefly fantasized about throwing our devices away, retreating to a cabin in the woods, and living software free lives. But the fantasy wouldn't keep still. It kept transforming into a picture of endless sitting around talking about past software troubles. We went in search of a better fantasy. One that would let us poke and push back. \n\nTogether, we picked up the word \"observation\", turning it over and around. We brought it right up to our noses and held it outstretched to get a better look, holding all of the histories of people looking at others and objects in mind, holding terminals and keyboards in hand. Observation, and the enabling of it through intensive data-centric feedback mechanisms, is part of the cybernetic spells that underpin present day software production. Syncing our breath to the rhythm of our software, we propose holistic observation as one way to enter an engagement with software's implications. Will you join us?\n\n(%CARLINSAYS: This guide is one answer to these questions, and it tickles.)\nThe Techno-Galactic Software Survival Guide (%CARLINSAYS: use agreed title) is an obsessive fantasy of optimization turned on its head, and stuck to the ceiling of a self-reflecting elevator. It is the ultimate book of dos and don'ts, of forgotten histories and un-inevitable futures, of mindful agile actions and improvisational service architectures, of any and all things that you can and cannot imagine needing in a techno-galaxy. We are techno-galactic as we meet the contemporary paradigms of computation that proudly announce their capability for \"scaling up to the universe.\" We stand here as modest witnesses to the scales of software communities and related political economies that involve and require observation. Reading is not enough, software is not just a text, observation is one potential beginning, engagement is tickling. (%CARLINSAYS: I kind of want to draw this idea of tickling out more. Something like: Can you call up that feeling of eagerly anticipating a touch that cannot be born with a straight face?) \n\nThis guide offers a set of practical and fantastical tools for the tactical (mis)use of software, empowering/enabling users to resist embedded paradigms and assumptions. It is a collection of methods for approaching software, experiencing its myths and realities, its risks and benefits. Drawing on theories of software and computation developed in academia and elsewhere, we grounded our methods in hands-on exercises and experiments that you now can try at home. This Guide to Techno-Galactic Software Observation (%CARLINSAYS: use agreed title) offers methods developed in and inspired by the context of software production, hacker culture, software studies, computer science research, Free Software communities, privacy activism, and artistic practice. It invites you to experiment with ways to stay with the trouble of software. Come join us at the edge of the universe, on the metro platform, at your kitchen table, as we mark and measure critical distances from and entanglements with the seemingly endless software systems that surround us.\n\n\nThe techno-galactic software survival guide (%CARLINSAYS: use agreed title) was collectively produced as an outcome of the Techno-Galactic Software Observatory. \n[This feels like it could be in a different font size or in brackets or is the start of the next page/spread?]\n\n\nkostas axelos, planetary interlude, maybe some bits fit with the intro?:\n\n%  We open ourselves to abysses and we are swallowed up in sys-\n%  tems and totalizations - for these are fragments and segments of\n%  \"totality\" which establish themselves as total and/or partial totali-\n%  tarisms - without foreseeing what might be the home, the house, the\n%  habitat of living, thinking man, an unfinished, unfinishable being in a\n%  history which is equally so, neither a shell stuck fast to a rock, nor a\n%  simple nomad or vagabond. Mortals wish for the familiar and for\n%  adventure, the known and the unknown, undecided as to who decides\n%  and to what he decides, chosen rather than choosing. Since they are\n%  unable to be their own master, they allow themselves to be fixed,\n%  tossed about, carried away, scattered and put to flight, incapable of\n%  choosing - if choice there be - between success in and in relation to\n%  the world, and the World. All this does not constitute an error; wan-\n%  dering (errance) commands it. \n Galactic irony is watching us. \n%  Dream of a shadow and dispenser of light, conquistador and\n%  deserter of the World, pawn and pioneer, man sets out to conquer\n%  the stars and he ploughs the sea. The assault he launches against the\n%  astral earth and against the celestial stars is not without disaster.\n Whether he delves into analysis and disintegration -- since he needs\n analyses, concrete and tangible solutions and experimentations -- or\n whether he plunges into syntheses -- since the abstracting power and\n the ungraspable attract him equally --, as precisely and as far as he\n may cast his nets, what his nets catch and what passes through them\n communicate. Never quite awake and never quite beclouded, will we\n learn to live and to see beings and things simultaneously from close\n up and far away, large and small, in their and in our wandering\n (errance), in the great World which is at the same time small, where\n there are no victors - would there be vanquished?\n\n## The Techno-Galactic Software Observatory\n\nIn the summer of 2017, thirty or so people gathered in Brussels to explore practices of proximate critique with and of software in the context of a worksession entitled \"Techno-Galactic Software Observatory\".[^]{Worksessions are intensive transdisciplinary moments, organised twice a year by Constant. They aim to provide conditions for participants with different experiences and capabilities to temporarily link their practice and to  develop ideas, prototypes and  research projects together. For the worksessions, primarily Free, Libre and Open Source software is used and material that is available under Open Content Licenses.} The worksession called for software-curious people of all kinds to ask questions about software. The intuition behind such a call was that developing different types of engagement requires a heterogeneous group of participants with different levels of expertise,  skill and background. During three sessions that were two days each, participants collectively inspected the space-time of computation and probed the universe of hardware-software separations through excursions, exercises and conversations. They tried out various perspectives and methods to look at the larger picture of software as a concept, as a practice, and as a set of techniques.\n\nThe first two days of The Techno-Galactic Software Observatory included visits to the Musée de l'Informatique Pionnière en Belgique [^]{http://www.nam-ip.be} in Namur and the Computermuseum KULeuven[^]{http://etwie.be/database/actor/computermuseum-ku-leuven}. Surrounded by these collections of historical ’numerical artefacts’, we started considering software in a long-term context (% CARLINSAYS: Do we mean a long historical context or longue duree or something else?). The museum visits provided an occasion to reflect on the conditions of software's appearance (% CARLINSAYS: appearances?) and to take on current-day questions from a genealogical perspective. What is software? How did it appear as a concept, in what industrial and governmental circumstances? What happens to the material conditions of its production (minerals, factory labor, hardware) when it evaporates into a cloud?\n\nThe second two days were spent focusing on the space-time dimension of IT development. The way computer programs and operating systems are manufactured has changed tremendously over the last seventy years, as has its production times and places. From military labs to the mega-corporation cubicles to the open-space freelancer utopia, what ruptures and continuities can be traced in the production, deployment, maintenance and destruction of software? From time-sharing to user-space partitions and containerization, what separations were and are at work? Where and when is software made today?\n\nThe last two days at the Techno-Galactic Software Observatory were dedicated to observation and its consequences. The development of software encompasses a series of practices whose evocative names are increasingly familiar: feedback, report, probe, audit, inspect, scan, diagnose, explore, test. What are the systems of knowledge and power within which these activities take place, and what other types of observation are possible? As a practical set for our investigations, we set up a walk-in clinic on the 25th floor of the World Trade Center, where users and developers could arrive with software-questions of all kinds.\n\n## The Walk-in Clinic (% CARLINSAYS: I think this title should go below the description of the walk-in clinic as the last two days of the observatory worksession and should come instead right above the invitation to the clinic so I have moved it there)\n\n> Do you suffer from the disappearance of your software into the cloud,\n> feel oppressed by unequal user privilege, or experience the torment of\n> software-ransom of any sort?\n> Bring your devices and interfaces to the World Trade Center!\n> With the help of a clear and in-depth session, at the Techno-Galactic\n> Walk-In Clinic we guarantee immediate results.\n> The  Walk-In Clinic provides free hands-on observations to software\n> curious  people of all kinds.

Software Observation\" or \"The Techno-Galactic Software Survival Guide\" or some other iteration?)\n\n> I am less interested in the critical practice of reflection,\n> of showing once-again that the

witness, 1996 from: http://observatory.constantvzw.org/etherdump/friday.md.diff.html\n\n (%CARLINSAYS: Software is everywhere)\nA spectre is haunting the galaxy. It is neither revolutionary [@marx:1848:cmanifesto] nor is it a global scale vulnerability [@meltdown:2018:spectre17], but no matter where you happen to be, there is the spectre of a software running somewhere in the background. Look! There it is, looking right back at you. Be it your phone screen or a passing satellite, software's observation and entanglement in the everyday appears complete. But is it so total? Let's look again. (%CARLINSAYS: I think this makes more sense up here but I also wonder if we want to flip on the notion of completeness so quickly?)\n\n(%CARLINSAYS: Online services have radically altered software and reconfigured society. This is the why of this project.)\n We find ourselves in a universe built on a 1990s revival of a 1960s dream: software as a service [@haigh:2001:soft60]. In this online universe, the use of software has increasingly been knitted into the production of software, even while the rhetoric, rights, and procedures continue to suggest that use and production constitute separate realms. This knitting together and its corresponding disavowal radically alters the operative role of software in society. The shifts ripple across galaxies, through social structures, working conditions, and personal relations, resulting in a profusion of apparatuses aspiring to be seamless while optimizing and monetizing individual and collective flows of information in line with the interests of a handful of actors. The diffusion of software services affects the individual person in the form of intensified identity shaping and self-management, and affects the public, as more and more libraries, universities and infrastructures rely on \"solutions\" provided by private companies for the management of public life. As online services increasingly centralize data flows in the clouds, they blur the last traces of the thin line separating bio- from necro-politics.\n\n(%CARLINSAYS: Given the state of things, what do we do? There are so many urgent questions...)\nGiven how quickly software resonates and reproduces, there is a growing urgency to engage it in manners that goes beyond taking a distance, and that deal with the fact that we are inevitably already entangled. How can we interact, respond to, and think with software? What approaches can we use to recognize the agency of different actors, their ways of working and their politics? What methods of observation are conducive to critical inquiry and affirmative discord? What techniques can we apply to resurface software, finding the sites where its infrastructures are reconfiguring the everyday? What methods will help us remember that software is always at work, especially where it is designed to disappear into the background? What do you think about who gets to watch software (and how) and who is being observed by software (and with what impact)? \n\nBowled over by these questions, by constant pop-ups and push notifications, we briefly fantasized about throwing our devices away, retreating to a cabin in the woods, and living software free lives. But the fantasy wouldn't keep still. It kept transforming into a picture of endless sitting around talking about past software troubles. We went in search of a better fantasy. One that would let us poke and push back. \n\nTogether, we picked up the word \"observation\", turning it over and around. We brought it right up to our noses and held it outstretched to get a better look, holding all of the histories of people looking at others and objects in mind, holding terminals (%CARLINSAYS: is this the right word?) and keyboards in hand. Observation, and the enabling of it through intensive data-centric feedback mechanisms, is part of the cybernetic spells that underpin present day software production. In this present moment, we sync our breath to the rhythm of our software and propose holistic observation as one way to enter an engagement with software's implications. Will you join us?\n\n(%CARLINSAYS: This guide is one answer to these questions, and it tickles.)\nThe Techno-Galactic Software Survival Guide (%CARLINSAYS: use agreed title) is an obsessive fantasy of optimization turned on its head, and stuck to the ceiling of a self-reflecting elevator. It is the ultimate book of dos and don'ts, of forgotten histories and un-inevitable futures, of mindful agile actions and improvisational service architectures, of any and all things that you can and cannot imagine needing in a techno-galaxy.  \n\nThis guide offers a set of practical and fantastical tools for the tactical (mis)use of software, empowering/enabling users to resist embedded paradigms and assumptions. It is a collection of methods for approaching software, experiencing its myths and realities, its risks and benefits. Drawing on theories of software and computation developed in academia and elsewhere, we grounded our methods in hands-on exercises and experiments that you now can try at home. This Guide to Techno-Galactic Software Observation (%CARLINSAYS: use agreed title) offers methods developed in and inspired by the context of software production, hacker culture, software studies, computer science research, Free Software communities, privacy activism, and artistic practice. It invites you to experiment with ways to stay with the trouble of software. We are techno-galactic as we meet thecontemporary paradigms of computation that proudly announce their capability for \"scaling up to the universe.\" We stand here as modest witnesses to the scales of software communities and related political economies that involve and require observation. Reading is not enough, software is not just a text, observation is one potential beginning, engagement is tickling. \n\nCan you call up that feeling of the approach of a touch that cannot be born with a straight face? Come join us at the edge of the universe, on the metro platform, at your kitchen table, as we mark and measure critical distances from and entanglements with the seemingly endless software systems that surround us.\n\n\nThe techno-galactic software survival guide (%CARLINSAYS: use agreed title) was collectively produced as an outcome of the Techno-Galactic Software Observatory. \n[This feels like it could be in a different font size or in brackets or is the start of the next page/spread?]\n\n\nkostas axelos, planetary interlude, maybe some bits fit with the intro?:\n\n%  We open ourselves to abysses and we are swallowed up in sys-\n%  tems and totalizations - for these are fragments and segments of\n%  \"totality\" which establish themselves as total and/or partial totali-\n%  tarisms - without foreseeing what might be the home, the house, the\n%  habitat of living, thinking man, an unfinished, unfinishable being in a\n%  history which is equally so, neither a shell stuck fast to a rock, nor a\n%  simple nomad or vagabond. Mortals wish for the familiar and for\n%  adventure, the known and the unknown, undecided as to who decides\n%  and to what he decides, chosen rather than choosing. Since they are\n%  unable to be their own master, they allow themselves to be fixed,\n%  tossed about, carried away, scattered and put to flight, incapable of\n%  choosing - if choice there be - between success in and in relation to\n%  the world, and the World. All this does not constitute an error; wan-\n%  dering (errance) commands it. \n Galactic irony is watching us. \n%  Dream of a shadow and dispenser of light, conquistador and\n%  deserter of the World, pawn and pioneer, man sets out to conquer\n%  the stars and he ploughs the sea. The assault he launches against the\n%  astral earth and against the celestial stars is not without disaster.\n Whether he delves into analysis and disintegration -- since he needs\n analyses, concrete and tangible solutions and experimentations -- or\n whether he plunges into syntheses -- since the abstracting power and\n the ungraspable attract him equally --, as precisely and as far as he\n may cast his nets, what his nets catch and what passes through them\n communicate. Never quite awake and never quite beclouded, will we\n learn to live and to see beings and things simultaneously from close\n up and far away, large and small, in their and in our wandering\n (errance), in the great World which is at the same time small, where\n there are no victors - would there be vanquished?\n\n## The Techno-Galactic Software Observatory\n\nIn the summer of 2017, thirty or so people gathered in Brussels to explore practices of proximate critique with and of software in the context of a worksession entitled \"Techno-Galactic Software Observatory\".[^]{Worksessions are intensive transdisciplinary moments, organised twice a year by Constant. They aim to provide conditions for participants with different experiences and capabilities to temporarily link their practice and to  develop ideas, prototypes and  research projects together. For the worksessions, primarily Free, Libre and Open Source software is used and material that is available under Open Content Licenses.} The worksession called for software-curious people of all kinds to ask questions about software. The intuition behind such a call was that developing different types of engagement requires a heterogeneous group of participants with different levels of expertise,  skill and background. During three sessions that were two days each, participants collectively inspected the space-time of computation and probed the universe of hardware-software separations through excursions, exercises and conversations. They tried out various perspectives and methods to look at the larger picture of software as a concept, as a practice, and as a set of techniques.\n\nThe first two days of The Techno-Galactic Software Observatory included visits to the Musée de l'Informatique Pionnière en Belgique [^]{http://www.nam-ip.be} in Namur and the Computermuseum KULeuven[^]{http://etwie.be/database/actor/computermuseum-ku-leuven}. Surrounded by these collections of historical ’numerical artefacts’, we started considering software in a long-term context (% CARLINSAYS: Do we mean a long historical context or longue duree or something else?). The museum visits provided an occasion to reflect on the conditions of software's appearance (% CARLINSAYS: appearances?) and to take on current-day questions from a genealogical perspective. What is software? How did it appear as a concept, in what industrial and governmental circumstances? What happens to the material conditions of its production (minerals, factory labor, hardware) when it evaporates into a cloud?\n\nThe second two days were spent focusing on the space-time dimension of IT development. The way computer programs and operating systems are manufactured has changed tremendously over the last seventy years, as has its production times and places. From military labs to the mega-corporation cubicles to the open-space freelancer utopia, what ruptures and continuities can be traced in the production, deployment, maintenance and destruction of software? From time-sharing to user-space partitions and containerization, what separations were and are at work? Where and when is software made today?\n\nThe last two days at the Techno-Galactic Software Observatory were dedicated to observation and its consequences. The development of software encompasses a series of practices whose evocative names are increasingly familiar: feedback, report, probe, audit, inspect, scan, diagnose, explore, test. What are the systems of knowledge and power within which these activities take place, and what other types of observation are possible? As a practical set for our investigations, we set up a walk-in clinic on the 25th floor of the World Trade Center, where users and developers could arrive with software-questions of all kinds.\n\n## The Walk-in Clinic (% CARLINSAYS: I think this title should go below the description of the walk-in clinic as the last two days of the observatory worksession and should come instead right above the invitation to the clinic so I have moved it there)\n\n> Do you suffer from the disappearance of your software into the cloud,\n> feel oppressed by unequal user privilege, or experience the torment of\n> software-ransom of any sort?\n> Bring your devices and interfaces to the World Trade Center!\n> With the help of a clear and in-depth session, at the Techno-Galactic\n> Walk-In Clinic we guarantee immediate results.\n> The  Walk-In Clinic provides free hands-on observations to software\n> curious  people of all kinds.

It also seems important to make sure that the two page list of services poster for the clinic is printed on pages that are facing each other. If they are already set to do that then maybe nix my suggestion of moving the intake form up, but if they are not then that would be one way to shift the pages to make that happen.)\n\n\n","attribs":"*0+n+1*7+3*0|2+2*7+2+2*6+1+8*6+1+6*6+1+8*6+1+8*6+1+a*6+1*7|2+2*6+2*7+1*6+5o|2+2+1q*0|1+1+1s*0|1+1+1p*0|1+1+18*6|1+1|3+3s*e+1*6+11*b|1+1*6+1r*0+1*e+b*6+1f*0+1*e+n*6+7*e+1*6+1g*e+1*6+3q*e+a*6+z*e+m*6+58*e|1+1*6|1+1*6+3d*e|1+1*6+2p*e+l*6+q*e+37*6+1*e+4g*6+3*e+g*6+c*e+2k*6+1*e+7e*6+h*e+1s*6+h*e+1h*6+1*e+1t*6+y*e+2*6+x*e+8*6+2*e+q*6+4*e+t*6+5*e+6*6+9*e|1+r*6|7+1kr*9|1+1*6|5+1cs*6+5l*6*d+q*6+2d*9|1+1*6|3+4k*6*j+32*6|2+2*f|3+23*0*c+2*a*c+1p*a|1+1*0*c+2*a*c+1t*a|1+1*0*c+2*a*c+1y*a|1+1*0*c+2*a*c+1w*a|1+1*0*c+2*a*c+20*a|1+1*0*c+2*a*c+21*a|1+1*0*c+2*a*c+1s*a|1+1*0*c+2*a*c+1u*a|1+1*0*c+2*a*c+1w*a|1+1*0*c+2*a*c+1u*0|1+1*0*c+2*a*c+1y*a|1+1*0*c+2*a*c+1y*a|1+1*0*c+2*a*c+1y*a|1+1*0*c+2*a*c+v*f|1+1*f*1+v*f+1*a|1+1*0+2*a+1*a*c+1m*a|1+1*0*c+2*a*c+1t*a|1+1*0*c+2*a*c+1y*a|1+1*0*c+2*a*c+1y*f|1+1*f+1g*0+1*f|1+h*f+1s*0+1*f|1+5*f+z*0+1*f|1+y*f+11*0+1*f|7+bt|1+1+17*0|1+1|1+1+t*6+6+4s*0+1+1*0+1+1*0+b3*9+m*0+1+3w*6+b+11*6+1+3c*6+9+9*6+5|2+8y+3p*0+1+1*0+m+15*0+1o+2*6+d+1v*6+b+w*6+2g+2*6+h+1*6+8*9+3+16*6+a+b*6+x|2+88+m*6+h+35*6+4+l*6+4+2*6+l+3*6+5+1h*6+2|2+95+w*6+1+8*6+1+8*6+1+6s*6+2|1+95*6|2+72|1+1*0+2*1+1x*0|1+1*0+2*1+1y*0|1+1*0+2*1+s*0|1+1*0+2*1+1o*0|1+1*0+2*1+1x*0|1+1*0+2*1+1a|1+1*0+2*1+1v*0|1+1*0+2*1+1z*0|1+1*0+2*1+1z*0|1+1*0+2*1+21*0|1+1*0+2*1+1x*0|1+1*0+2*1+1t*0|1+1*0*1+2*1+1d*0|1+1*0+2*1+10*0|1+1*0+2*1+l|1+1*0+7+16*0+1|2+2*0+2+n*0|1+1*0+2+1j*7|1+1*0+2|1+1f*7|5+6h*7+1r*0|1+1*7|2+46*0|1+1*6+cs*a|1+1*6|1+1|1+1"}}},"pad:observatory.guide.introduction:revs:4901":{"changeset":"Z:bdr<1|h=13k=qp-1$","meta":{"author":"a.EXnmpSWanmHBGv1u","timestamp":1520190950515}},"pad:observatory.guide.introduction:revs:4902":{"changeset":"Z:bdq>1|h=13k=qp*6+1$

TOCTITLE: Introduction\n\nA guide to techno-galactic software observation\n==========================================\n\n> I am less interested in the critical practice of reflection, of showing once-again\n> that the emperor has no clothes, than in finding a way to _diffract_ critical inquiry\n> in order to make difference patterns in a more worldly way.\n> [@haraway:1996:witness]\n% p429, Haraway, modest witness, 1996 from: http://observatory.constantvzw.org/etherdump/friday.md.diff.html\n\nThe techno-galactic software survival guide that you are reading right now was collectively produced as an outcome of the Techno-Galactic Software Observatory. This guide proposes several ways to achieve critical distance from the seemingly endless software systems that surround us. It offers practical and fantastical tools for the tactical (mis)use of software, empowering/enabling users to resist embedded paradigms and assumptions. It is a collection of methods for approaching software, experiencing its myths and realities, its risks and benefits.\n\nWith the rise of online services, the use of software has increasingly been knitted into the production of software, even while the rhetoric, rights, and procedures continue to suggest that use and production constitute separate realms. This knitting together and its corresponding disavowal have an effect on the way software is used and produced, and radically alters its operative role in society. The shifts ripple across galaxies, through social structures, working conditions and personal relations, resulting in a profusion of apparatuses aspiring to be seamless while optimizing and monetizing individual and collective flows of information in line with the interests of a handful of actors. The diffusion of software services affects the personal, in the form of intensified identity shaping and self-management. It also affects the public, as more and more libraries, universities and public infrastructures as well as the management of public life rely on \"solutions\" provided by private companies. Centralizing data flows in the clouds, services blur the last traces of the thin line that separates bio- from necro-politics.\n\nGiven how fast these changes resonate and reproduce, there is a growing urgency to engage in a critique of software that goes beyond taking a distance, and that deals with the fact that we are inevitably already entangled. How can we interact, intervene, respond and think with software? What approaches can allow us to recognize the agency of different actors, their ways of functioning and their politics? What methods of observation enable critical inquiry and affirmative discord? What techniques can we apply to resurface software where it has melted into the infrastructure and into the everyday? How can we remember that software is always at work, especially where it is designed to disappear into the background?\n\nWe adopted the term of observation for a number of reasons. We regard observation as a way to approach software, as one way to organize engagement with its implications. Observation, and the enabling of observation through intensive data-centric feedback mechanisms, is part of  the cybernetic principles that underpin present day software production. Our aim was to scrutinize this methodology in its many manifestations, including in \"observatories\" -- high cost infrastructures [testing infrastructures?] of observation troubled by colonial, imperial traditions and their problematic divisions of nature and culture -- with the hope of opening up questions about who gets to observe software (and how) and who is being observed by software (and with what impact)? It is a question of power, one that we answer, at least in part, with critical play.\n\nWe adopted the term techno-galactic to match the advertised capability of \"scaling up to the universe\" that comes in contemporary paradigms of computation, and to address different scales of software communities and related political economies that involve and require observation.\n\nDrawing on theories of software and computation developed in academia and elsewhere, we grounded our methods in hands-on exercises and experiments that you now can try at home. This Guide to Techno-Galactic Software Observation offers methods developed in and inspired by the context of software production, hacker culture, software studies, computer science research, Free Software communities, privacy activism, and artistic practice. It invites you to experiment with ways to stay with the trouble of software.\n\n% http://observatory.constantvzw.org/images/friday/P1010328.JPG\n% SHOW: tgsoimages.svg tgsoteam\n% INFO: Techno-Galactic Software Observation team, WTC Brussels, June 2017\n\n\n## The Techno-Galactic Software Observatory\nIn the summer of 2017, around thirty people gathered in Brussels to explore practices of proximate critique with and of software in the context of a worksession entitled \"Techno-Galactic Software Observatory\".[^]{Worksessions are intensive transdisciplinary moments, organised twice a year by Constant. They aim to provide conditions for participants with different experiences and capabilities to temporarily link their practice and to  develop ideas, prototypes and  research projects together.

The intuition behind such a call was that different types of engagement requires a heterogeneous group of participants with different levels of expertise,  skill and background. During three sessions of two days, participants collectively inspected the space-time of computation and probed the universe of hardware-software separations through excursions, exercises and conversations. They tried out various perspectives and methods to look at the larger picture of software as a concept, as a practice, and as a set of techniques.\n\nThe first two days of The Techno-Galactic Software Observatory included visits to the Musée de l'Informatique Pionnière en Belgique [^]{http://www.nam-ip.be} in Namur and the Computermuseum KULeuven[^]{http://www.etwie.be/database/actor/computermuseum-ku-leuven}. In the surroundings of these collections of historical ’numerical artefacts’, we started viewing software in a long-term context. It offered us the occasion to reflect on the conditions of its appearance, and allowed us to take on current-day questions from a genealogical perspective. What is software? How did it appear as a concept, in what industrial and governmental circumstances? What happens to the material conditions of its production (minerals, factory labor, hardware) when it evaporates into a cloud?\n\nThe second two days we focused on the space-time dimension of IT development. The way computer programs and operating systems are manufactured changed tremendously through time, and so did its production times and places. From military labs via the mega-corporation cubicles to the open-space freelancer utopia, what ruptures and continuities can be traced in the production, deployment, maintenance and destruction of software? From time-sharing to user-space partitions and containerization, what separations were and are at work? Where and when is software made today?\n\n## The Walk-in Clinic\n\nThe last two days at the Techno-galactic software observatory were dedicated to observation and its consequences. The development of software encompasses a series of practices whose evocative names are increasingly familiar: feedback, report, probe, audit, inspect, scan, diagnose, explore, test ... What are the systems of knowledge and power within which these activities take place, and what other types of observation are possible? As a practical set for our investigations, we set up a walk-in clinic on the 25th floor of the World Trade Center, where users and developers could arrive with software-questions of all kinds.\n\n% http://gallery.constantvzw.org/index.php/Techno-Galactic-Software-Observatory/IMAG1399 \n% TODO: % SHOW: tgsoimages.svg scppath\n% TODO: % INFO: Documenting the path of a Software Curious Person going through the Walk-in Clinic\n\n\n> Do you suffer from the disappearance of your software into the cloud,\n> feel oppressed by unequal user privilege, or experience the torment of\n> software-ransom of any sort?\n> Bring your devices and interfaces to the World Trade Center!\n> With the help of a clear and in-depth session, at the Techno-Galactic\n> Walk-In Clinic we guarantee immediate results.\n> The  Walk-In Clinic provides free hands-on observations to software\n> curious  people of all kinds.

It is neither revolutionary [@marx:1848:cmanifesto] nor is it a global scale vulnerability [@meltdown:2018:spectre17], but no matter where you happen to be, there is the spectre of a software running somewhere in the background. Look! There it is, looking right back at you. Be it your phone screen or a passing satellite, software's observation and entanglement in the everyday appears complete. But is it so total? Let's look again. (%CARLINSAYS: I think this makes more sense up here but I also wonder if we want to flip on the notion of completeness so quickly?)\n\n(%CARLINSAYS: Online services have radically altered software and reconfigured society. This is the why of this project.)\n We find ourselves in a universe built on a 1990s revival of a 1960s dream: software as a service [@haigh:2001:soft60]. In this online universe, the use of software has increasingly been knitted into the production of software, even while the rhetoric, rights, and procedures continue to suggest that use and production constitute separate realms. This knitting together and its corresponding disavowal radically alters the operative role of software in society. The shifts ripple across galaxies, through social structures, working conditions, and personal relations, resulting in a profusion of apparatuses that aspire to be seamless while optimizing and monetizing individual and collective flows of information in line with the interests of a handful of actors. The diffusion of software services affects individuals and communities in the form of intensified identity shaping and self-management, and affects the public, as institutions, a infrastructures rely on \"solutions\" provided by private companies for the management of public life. As online services increasingly centralize data flows in the clouds, they blur the last traces of the thin line separating bio- from necro-politics.\n\n(%CARLINSAYS: Given the state of things, what do we do? There are so many urgent questions...)\nGiven how quickly software resonates and reproduces, there is a growing urgency to engage it in manners that goes beyond taking a distance, and that deal with the fact that we are inevitably already entangled. How can we interact, respond to, and think with software? What approaches can we use to recognize the agency of different actors, their ways of working and their politics? What methods of observation are conducive to critical inquiry and affirmative discord? What techniques can we apply to resurface software, finding the sites where its infrastructures are reconfiguring the everyday? What methods will help us remember that software is always at work, especially where it is designed to disappear into the background? What do you think about who gets to watch software (and how) and who is being observed by software (and with what impact)? \n\nBowled over by these questions, by constant pop-ups and push notifications, we briefly fantasized about throwing our devices away, retreating to a cabin in the woods, and living software free lives. But the fantasy wouldn't keep still. It kept transforming into a picture of endless sitting around talking about past software troubles. We went in search of a better fantasy. One that would let us poke and push back. \n\nTogether, we picked up the word \"observation\", turning it over and around. We brought it right up to our noses and held it outstretched to get a better look, holding all of the histories of people looking at others and objects in mind, holding terminals (%CARLINSAYS: is this the right word?) and keyboards in hand. Observation, and the enabling of it through intensive data-centric feedback mechanisms, is part of the cybernetic spells that underpin present day software production. In this present moment, we sync our breath to the rhythm of our software and propose holistic observation as one way to enter an engagement with software's implications. Will you join us?\n\n(%CARLINSAYS: This guide is one answer to these questions, and it tickles.)\nThe Techno-Galactic Software Survival Guide (%CARLINSAYS: use agreed title) is an obsessive fantasy of optimization turned on its head, and stuck to the ceiling of a self-reflecting elevator. It is the ultimate book of dos and don'ts, of forgotten histories and un-inevitable futures, of mindful agile actions and improvisational service architectures, of any and all things that you can and cannot imagine needing in a techno-galaxy.  \n\nThis guide offers a set of practical and fantastical tools for the tactical (mis)use of software, empowering/enabling users to resist embedded paradigms and assumptions. It is a collection of methods for approaching software, experiencing its myths and realities, its risks and benefits. Drawing on theories of software and computation developed in academia and elsewhere, we grounded our methods in hands-on exercises and experiments that you now can try at home. This Guide to Techno-Galactic Software Observation (%CARLINSAYS: use agreed title) offers methods developed in and inspired by the context of software production, hacker culture, software studies, computer science research, Free Software communities, privacy activism, and artistic practice. It invites you to experiment with ways to stay with the trouble of software. We are techno-galactic as we meet thecontemporary paradigms of computation that proudly announce their capability for \"scaling up to the universe.\" We stand here as modest witnesses to the scales of software communities and related political economies that involve and require observation. Reading is not enough, software is not just a text, observation is one potential beginning, engagement is tickling. \n\nCan you call up that feeling of the approach of a touch that cannot be born with a straight face? Come join us at the edge of the universe, on the metro platform, at your kitchen table, as we mark and measure critical distances from and entanglements with the seemingly endless software systems that surround us.\n\n\nThe techno-galactic software survival guide (%CARLINSAYS: use agreed title) was collectively produced as an outcome of the Techno-Galactic Software Observatory. \n[This feels like it could be in a different font size or in brackets or is the start of the next page/spread?]\n\n\nkostas axelos, planetary interlude, maybe some bits fit with the intro?:\n\n%  We open ourselves to abysses and we are swallowed up in sys-\n%  tems and totalizations - for these are fragments and segments of\n%  \"totality\" which establish themselves as total and/or partial totali-\n%  tarisms - without foreseeing what might be the home, the house, the\n%  habitat of living, thinking man, an unfinished, unfinishable being in a\n%  history which is equally so, neither a shell stuck fast to a rock, nor a\n%  simple nomad or vagabond. Mortals wish for the familiar and for\n%  adventure, the known and the unknown, undecided as to who decides\n%  and to what he decides, chosen rather than choosing. Since they are\n%  unable to be their own master, they allow themselves to be fixed,\n%  tossed about, carried away, scattered and put to flight, incapable of\n%  choosing - if choice there be - between success in and in relation to\n%  the world, and the World. All this does not constitute an error; wan-\n%  dering (errance) commands it. \n Galactic irony is watching us. \n%  Dream of a shadow and dispenser of light, conquistador and\n%  deserter of the World, pawn and pioneer, man sets out to conquer\n%  the stars and he ploughs the sea. The assault he launches against the\n%  astral earth and against the celestial stars is not without disaster.\n Whether he delves into analysis and disintegration -- since he needs\n analyses, concrete and tangible solutions and experimentations -- or\n whether he plunges into syntheses -- since the abstracting power and\n the ungraspable attract him equally --, as precisely and as far as he\n may cast his nets, what his nets catch and what passes through them\n communicate. Never quite awake and never quite beclouded, will we\n learn to live and to see beings and things simultaneously from close\n up and far away, large and small, in their and in our wandering\n (errance), in the great World which is at the same time small, where\n there are no victors - would there be vanquished?\n\n## The Techno-Galactic Software Observatory\n\nIn the summer of 2017, thirty or so people gathered in Brussels to explore practices of proximate critique with and of software in the context of a worksession entitled \"Techno-Galactic Software Observatory\".[^]{Worksessions are intensive transdisciplinary moments, organised twice a year by Constant.

everywhere)\nA spectre is haunting the galaxy. It is neither revolutionary [@marx:1848:cmanifesto] nor is it a global scale vulnerability [@meltdown:2018:spectre17], but no matter where you happen to be, there is the spectre of a software running somewhere in the background. Look! There it is, looking right back at you. Be it your phone screen or a passing satellite, software's observation and entanglement in the everyday appears complete. But is it so total? Let's look again. (%CARLINSAYS: I think this makes more sense up here but I also wonder if we want to flip on the notion of completeness so quickly?)\n\n(%CARLINSAYS: Online services have radically altered software and reconfigured society. This is the why of this project.)\n We find ourselves in a universe built on a 1990s revival of a 1960s dream: software as a service [@haigh:2001:soft60]. In this online universe, the use of software has increasingly been knitted into the production of software, even while the rhetoric, rights, and procedures continue to suggest that use and production constitute separate realms. This knitting together and its corresponding disavowal radically alters the operative role of software in society. The shifts ripple across galaxies, through social structures, working conditions, and personal relations, resulting in a profusion of apparatuses that aspire to be seamless while optimizing and monetizing individual and collective flows of information in line with the interests of a handful of actors. The diffusion of software services affects individuals and communities in the form of intensified identity shaping and self-management, and affects the public, as institutions and common use infrastructures increasingly rely on \"solutions\" provided by private companies for their management. As online services increasingly centralize data flows in the clouds, they blur the last traces of the thin line separating bio- from necro-politics.\n(%CARLINSAYS:Tung Hui Hu The Prehistory of the Cloud https://mitpress.mit.edu/prehistory-cloud )\n\n(%CARLINSAYS: Given the state of things, what do we do? There are so many urgent questions...)\nGiven how software resonates and reproduces, there is a reflex to take a distance, only to notice that it and that deal with the fact that we are inevitably already entangled. How can we interact, respond to, and think with software? What approaches can we use to recognize the agency of different actors, their ways of working and their politics? What methods of observation are conducive to critical inquiry and affirmative discord? What techniques can we apply to resurface software, finding the sites where its infrastructures are reconfiguring the everyday? What methods will help us remember that software is always at work, especially where it is designed to disappear into the background? What do you think about who gets to watch software (and how) and who is being observed by software (and with what impact)? \n\nBowled over by these questions, by constant pop-ups and push notifications, we briefly fantasized about throwing our devices away, retreating to a cabin in the woods, and living software free lives. But the fantasy wouldn't keep still. It kept transforming into a picture of endless sitting around talking about past software troubles. We went in search of a better fantasy. One that would let us poke and push back. \n\nTogether, we picked up the word \"observation\", turning it over and around. We brought it right up to our noses and held it outstretched to get a better look, holding all of the histories of people looking at others and objects in mind, holding terminals (%CARLINSAYS: is this the right word?) and keyboards in hand. Observation, and the enabling of it through intensive data-centric feedback mechanisms, is part of the cybernetic spells that underpin present day software production. In this present moment, we sync our breath to the rhythm of our software and propose holistic observation as one way to enter an engagement with software's implications. Will you join us?\n\n(%CARLINSAYS: This guide is one answer to these questions, and it tickles.)\nThe Techno-Galactic Software Survival Guide (%CARLINSAYS: use agreed title) is an obsessive fantasy of optimization turned on its head, and stuck to the ceiling of a self-reflecting elevator. It is the ultimate book of dos and don'ts, of forgotten histories and un-inevitable futures, of mindful agile actions and improvisational service architectures, of any and all things that you can and cannot imagine needing in a techno-galaxy.  \n\nThis guide offers a set of practical and fantastical tools for the tactical (mis)use of software, empowering/enabling users to resist embedded paradigms and assumptions. It is a collection of methods for approaching software, experiencing its myths and realities, its risks and benefits. Drawing on theories of software and computation developed in academia and elsewhere, we grounded our methods in hands-on exercises and experiments that you now can try at home. This Guide to Techno-Galactic Software Observation (%CARLINSAYS: use agreed title) offers methods developed in and inspired by the context of software production, hacker culture, software studies, computer science research, Free Software communities, privacy activism, and artistic practice. It invites you to experiment with ways to stay with the trouble of software. We are techno-galactic as we meet thecontemporary paradigms of computation that proudly announce their capability for \"scaling up to the universe.\" We stand here as modest witnesses to the scales of software communities and related political economies that involve and require observation. Reading is not enough, software is not just a text, observation is one potential beginning, engagement is tickling. \n\nCan you call up that feeling of the approach of a touch that cannot be born with a straight face? Come join us at the edge of the universe, on the metro platform, at your kitchen table, as we mark and measure critical distances from and entanglements with the seemingly endless software systems that surround us.\n\n\nThe techno-galactic software survival guide (%CARLINSAYS: use agreed title) was collectively produced as an outcome of the Techno-Galactic Software Observatory. \n[This feels like it could be in a different font size or in brackets or is the start of the next page/spread?]\n\n\nkostas axelos, planetary interlude, maybe some bits fit with the intro?:\n\n%  We open ourselves to abysses and we are swallowed up in sys-\n%  tems and totalizations - for these are fragments and segments of\n%  \"totality\" which establish themselves as total and/or partial totali-\n%  tarisms - without foreseeing what might be the home, the house, the\n%  habitat of living, thinking man, an unfinished, unfinishable being in a\n%  history which is equally so, neither a shell stuck fast to a rock, nor a\n%  simple nomad or vagabond. Mortals wish for the familiar and for\n%  adventure, the known and the unknown, undecided as to who decides\n%  and to what he decides, chosen rather than choosing. Since they are\n%  unable to be their own master, they allow themselves to be fixed,\n%  tossed about, carried away, scattered and put to flight, incapable of\n%  choosing - if choice there be - between success in and in relation to\n%  the world, and the World. All this does not constitute an error; wan-\n%  dering (errance) commands it. \n Galactic irony is watching us. \n%  Dream of a shadow and dispenser of light, conquistador and\n%  deserter of the World, pawn and pioneer, man sets out to conquer\n%  the stars and he ploughs the sea. The assault he launches against the\n%  astral earth and against the celestial stars is not without disaster.\n Whether he delves into analysis and disintegration -- since he needs\n analyses, concrete and tangible solutions and experimentations -- or\n whether he plunges into syntheses -- since the abstracting power and\n the ungraspable attract him equally --, as precisely and as far as he\n may cast his nets, what his nets catch and what passes through them\n communicate. Never quite awake and never quite beclouded, will we\n learn to live and to see beings and things simultaneously from close\n up and far away, large and small, in their and in our wandering\n (errance), in the great World which is at the same time small, where\n there are no victors - would there be vanquished?\n\n## The Techno-Galactic Software Observatory\n\nIn the summer of 2017, thirty or so people gathered in Brussels to explore practices of proximate critique with and of software in the context of a worksession entitled \"Techno-Galactic Software Observatory\".[^]{Worksessions are intensive transdisciplinary moments, organised twice a year by Constant. They aim to provide conditions for participants with different experiences and capabilities to temporarily link their practice and to  develop ideas, prototypes and  research projects together. For the worksessions, primarily Free, Libre and Open Source software is used and material that is available under Open Content Licenses.} The worksession called for software-curious people of all kinds to ask questions about software. The intuition behind such a call was that developing different types of engagement requires a heterogeneous group of participants with different levels of expertise,  skill and background. During three sessions that were two days each, participants collectively inspected the space-time of computation and probed the universe of hardware-software separations through excursions, exercises and conversations. They tried out various perspectives and methods to look at the larger picture of software as a concept, as a practice, and as a set of techniques.\n\nThe first two days of The Techno-Galactic Software Observatory included visits to the Musée de l'Informatique Pionnière en Belgique [^]{http://www.nam-ip.be} in Namur and the Computermuseum KULeuven[^]{http://etwie.be/database/actor/computermuseum-ku-leuven}. Surrounded by these collections of historical ’numerical artefacts’, we started considering software in a long-term context (% CARLINSAYS: Do we mean a long historical context or longue duree or something else?). The museum visits provided an occasion to reflect on the conditions of software's appearance (% CARLINSAYS: appearances?) and to take on current-day questions from a genealogical perspective. What is software? How did it appear as a concept, in what industrial and governmental circumstances? What happens to the material conditions of its production (minerals, factory labor, hardware) when it evaporates into a cloud?\n\nThe second two days were spent focusing on the space-time dimension of IT development. The way computer programs and operating systems are manufactured has changed tremendously over the last seventy years, as has its production times and places. From military labs to the mega-corporation cubicles to the open-space freelancer utopia, what ruptures and continuities can be traced in the production, deployment, maintenance and destruction of software? From time-sharing to user-space partitions and containerization, what separations were and are at work? Where and when is software made today?\n\nThe last two days at the Techno-Galactic Software Observatory were dedicated to observation and its consequences. The development of software encompasses a series of practices whose evocative names are increasingly familiar: feedback, report, probe, audit, inspect, scan, diagnose, explore, test. What are the systems of knowledge and power within which these activities take place, and what other types of observation are possible? As a practical set for our investigations, we set up a walk-in clinic on the 25th floor of the World Trade Center, where users and developers could arrive with software-questions of all kinds.\n\n## The Walk-in Clinic (% CARLINSAYS: I think this title should go below the description of the walk-in clinic as the last two days of the observatory worksession and should come instead right above the invitation to the clinic so I have moved it there)\n\n> Do you suffer from the disappearance of your software into the cloud,\n> feel oppressed by unequal user privilege, or experience the torment of\n> software-ransom of any sort?\n> Bring your devices and interfaces to the World Trade Center!\n> With the help of a clear and in-depth session, at the Techno-Galactic\n> Walk-In Clinic we guarantee immediate results.\n> The  Walk-In Clinic provides free hands-on observations to software\n> curious  people of all kinds.

It also seems important to make sure that the two page list of services poster for the clinic is printed on pages that are facing each other. If they are already set to do that then maybe nix my suggestion of moving the intake form up, but if they are not then that would be one way to shift the pages to make that happen.)\n\n\n","attribs":"*0+n+1*7+3*0|2+2*7+2+2*6+1+8*6+1+6*6+1+8*6+1+8*6+1+a*6+1*7|2+2*6+2*7+1*6+5o|2+2+1q*0|1+1+1s*0|1+1+1p*0|1+1+18*6|1+1|3+3s*e+1*6+11*b|1+1*6+1r*0+1*e+b*6+1f*0+1*e+n*6+7*e+1*6+1g*e+1*6+3q*e+a*6+z*e+m*6+58*e|1+1*6|1+1*6+3d*e|1+1*6+2p*e+l*6+q*e+37*6+1*e+4g*6+3*e+g*6+c*e+2k*6+1*e+1t*6+c*e+58*6+r*e+1s*6+h*e+c*6+d*e+4*6+b*e+26*6+8*e+2*6+b*e+2*6+x*e+8*6+2*e+q*6+4*e+t*6+5*e+6*6+9*e|2+3g*6|2+2o*6+1u*e+4*6+d*e+n*6|5+1e7*9|1+1*6|5+1cs*6+5l*6*d+q*6+2d*9|1+1*6|3+4k*6*j+32*6|2+2*f|3+23*0*c+2*a*c+1p*a|1+1*0*c+2*a*c+1t*a|1+1*0*c+2*a*c+1y*a|1+1*0*c+2*a*c+1w*a|1+1*0*c+2*a*c+20*a|1+1*0*c+2*a*c+21*a|1+1*0*c+2*a*c+1s*a|1+1*0*c+2*a*c+1u*a|1+1*0*c+2*a*c+1w*a|1+1*0*c+2*a*c+1u*0|1+1*0*c+2*a*c+1y*a|1+1*0*c+2*a*c+1y*a|1+1*0*c+2*a*c+1y*a|1+1*0*c+2*a*c+v*f|1+1*f*1+v*f+1*a|1+1*0+2*a+1*a*c+1m*a|1+1*0*c+2*a*c+1t*a|1+1*0*c+2*a*c+1y*a|1+1*0*c+2*a*c+1y*f|1+1*f+1g*0+1*f|1+h*f+1s*0+1*f|1+5*f+z*0+1*f|1+y*f+11*0+1*f|7+bt|1+1+17*0|1+1|1+1+t*6+6+4s*0+1+1*0+1+1*0+b3*9+m*0+1+3w*6+b+11*6+1+3c*6+9+9*6+5|2+8y+3p*0+1+1*0+m+15*0+1o+2*6+d+1v*6+b+w*6+2g+2*6+h+1*6+8*9+3+16*6+a+b*6+x|2+88+m*6+h+35*6+4+l*6+4+2*6+l+3*6+5+1h*6+2|2+95+w*6+1+8*6+1+8*6+1+6s*6+2|1+95*6|2+72|1+1*0+2*1+1x*0|1+1*0+2*1+1y*0|1+1*0+2*1+s*0|1+1*0+2*1+1o*0|1+1*0+2*1+1x*0|1+1*0+2*1+1a|1+1*0+2*1+1v*0|1+1*0+2*1+1z*0|1+1*0+2*1+1z*0|1+1*0+2*1+21*0|1+1*0+2*1+1x*0|1+1*0+2*1+1t*0|1+1*0*1+2*1+1d*0|1+1*0+2*1+10*0|1+1*0+2*1+l|1+1*0+7+16*0+1|2+2*0+2+n*0|1+1*0+2+1j*7|1+1*0+2|1+1f*7|5+6h*7+1r*0|1+1*7|2+46*0|1+1*6+cs*a|1+1*6|1+1|1+1"}}},"pad:observatory.guide.introduction:revs:5101":{"changeset":"Z:bfd>3|l=26g=2y*e+3$is

witness, 1996 from: http://observatory.constantvzw.org/etherdump/friday.md.diff.html\n\n (%CARLINSAYS: Software is everywhere)\nA spectre is haunting the galaxy. It is neither revolutionary [@marx:1848:cmanifesto] nor is it a global scale vulnerability [@meltdown:2018:spectre17], but no matter where you happen to be, there is the spectre of a software running somewhere in the background. Look! There it is, looking right back at you. Be it your phone screen or a passing satellite, software's observation and entanglement in the everyday appears complete. But is it so total? Let's look again. (%CARLINSAYS: I think this makes more sense up here but I also wonder if we want to flip on the notion of completeness so quickly?)\n\n(%CARLINSAYS: Online services have radically altered software and reconfigured society. This is the why of this project.)\n We find ourselves in a universe built on a 1990s revival of a 1960s dream: software as a service [@haigh:2001:soft60]. In this online universe, the use of software has increasingly been knitted into the production of software, even while the rhetoric, rights, and procedures continue to suggest that use and production constitute separate realms. This knitting together and its corresponding disavowal radically alters the operative role of software in society. The shifts ripple across galaxies, through social structures, working conditions, and personal relations, resulting in a profusion of apparatuses that aspire to be seamless while optimizing and monetizing individual and collective flows of information in line with the interests of a handful of actors. The diffusion of software services affects individuals and communities in the form of intensified identity shaping and self-management, and affects the public, as institutions and common use infrastructures increasingly rely on \"solutions\" provided by private companies for their management. As online services increasingly centralize data flows in the clouds, they blur the last traces of the thin line separating bio- from necro-politics.\n(%CARLINSAYS:Tung Hui Hu The Prehistory of the Cloud https://mitpress.mit.edu/prehistory-cloud )\n\n(%CARLINSAYS: Given the state of things, what do we do? There are so many urgent questions...)\nGiven how software spins its web around us, our first reflex is to make an attempt to take a distance, only to realize that it is a gooey net in which we are already entangled. Caught How can we interact, respond to, and think with software? What approaches can we use to recognize the agency of different actors, their ways of working and their politics? What methods of observation are conducive to critical inquiry and affirmative discord? What techniques can we apply to resurface software, finding the sites where its infrastructures are reconfiguring the everyday? What methods will help us remember that software is always at work, especially where it is designed to disappear into the background? What do you think about who gets to watch software (and how) and who is being observed by software (and with what impact)? \n\nBowled over by these questions, by constant pop-ups and push notifications, we briefly fantasized about throwing our devices away, retreating to a cabin in the woods, and living software free lives. But the fantasy wouldn't keep still. It kept transforming into a picture of endless sitting around talking about past software troubles. We went in search of a better fantasy. One that would let us poke and push back. \n\nTogether, we picked up the word \"observation\", turning it over and around. We brought it right up to our noses and held it outstretched to get a better look, holding all of the histories of people looking at others and objects in mind, holding terminals (%CARLINSAYS: is this the right word?) and keyboards in hand. Observation, and the enabling of it through intensive data-centric feedback mechanisms, is part of the cybernetic spells that underpin present day software production. In this present moment, we sync our breath to the rhythm of our software and propose holistic observation as one way to enter an engagement with software's implications. Will you join us?\n\n(%CARLINSAYS: This guide is one answer to these questions, and it tickles.)\nThe Techno-Galactic Software Survival Guide (%CARLINSAYS: use agreed title) is an obsessive fantasy of optimization turned on its head, and stuck to the ceiling of a self-reflecting elevator. It is the ultimate book of dos and don'ts, of forgotten histories and un-inevitable futures, of mindful agile actions and improvisational service architectures, of any and all things that you can and cannot imagine needing in a techno-galaxy.  \n\nThis guide offers a set of practical and fantastical tools for the tactical (mis)use of software, empowering/enabling users to resist embedded paradigms and assumptions. It is a collection of methods for approaching software, experiencing its myths and realities, its risks and benefits. Drawing on theories of software and computation developed in academia and elsewhere, we grounded our methods in hands-on exercises and experiments that you now can try at home. This Guide to Techno-Galactic Software Observation (%CARLINSAYS: use agreed title) offers methods developed in and inspired by the context of software production, hacker culture, software studies, computer science research, Free Software communities, privacy activism, and artistic practice. It invites you to experiment with ways to stay with the trouble of software. We are techno-galactic as we meet thecontemporary paradigms of computation that proudly announce their capability for \"scaling up to the universe.\" We stand here as modest witnesses to the scales of software communities and related political economies that involve and require observation. Reading is not enough, software is not just a text, observation is one potential beginning, engagement is tickling. \n\nCan you call up that feeling of the approach of a touch that cannot be born with a straight face? Come join us at the edge of the universe, on the metro platform, at your kitchen table, as we mark and measure critical distances from and entanglements with the seemingly endless software systems that surround us.\n\n\nThe techno-galactic software survival guide (%CARLINSAYS: use agreed title) was collectively produced as an outcome of the Techno-Galactic Software Observatory. \n[This feels like it could be in a different font size or in brackets or is the start of the next page/spread?]\n\n\nkostas axelos, planetary interlude, maybe some bits fit with the intro?:\n\n%  We open ourselves to abysses and we are swallowed up in sys-\n%  tems and totalizations - for these are fragments and segments of\n%  \"totality\" which establish themselves as total and/or partial totali-\n%  tarisms - without foreseeing what might be the home, the house, the\n%  habitat of living, thinking man, an unfinished, unfinishable being in a\n%  history which is equally so, neither a shell stuck fast to a rock, nor a\n%  simple nomad or vagabond. Mortals wish for the familiar and for\n%  adventure, the known and the unknown, undecided as to who decides\n%  and to what he decides, chosen rather than choosing. Since they are\n%  unable to be their own master, they allow themselves to be fixed,\n%  tossed about, carried away, scattered and put to flight, incapable of\n%  choosing - if choice there be - between success in and in relation to\n%  the world, and the World. All this does not constitute an error; wan-\n%  dering (errance) commands it. \n Galactic irony is watching us. \n%  Dream of a shadow and dispenser of light, conquistador and\n%  deserter of the World, pawn and pioneer, man sets out to conquer\n%  the stars and he ploughs the sea. The assault he launches against the\n%  astral earth and against the celestial stars is not without disaster.\n Whether he delves into analysis and disintegration -- since he needs\n analyses, concrete and tangible solutions and experimentations -- or\n whether he plunges into syntheses -- since the abstracting power and\n the ungraspable attract him equally --, as precisely and as far as he\n may cast his nets, what his nets catch and what passes through them\n communicate. Never quite awake and never quite beclouded, will we\n learn to live and to see beings and things simultaneously from close\n up and far away, large and small, in their and in our wandering\n (errance), in the great World which is at the same time small, where\n there are no victors - would there be vanquished?\n\n## The Techno-Galactic Software Observatory\n\nIn the summer of 2017, thirty or so people gathered in Brussels to explore practices of proximate critique with and of software in the context of a worksession entitled \"Techno-Galactic Software Observatory\".[^]{Worksessions are intensive transdisciplinary moments, organised twice a year by Constant. They aim to provide conditions for participants with different experiences and capabilities to temporarily link their practice and to  develop ideas, prototypes and  research projects together. For the worksessions, primarily Free, Libre and Open Source software is used and material that is available under Open Content Licenses.} The worksession called for software-curious people of all kinds to ask questions about software. The intuition behind such a call was that developing different types of engagement requires a heterogeneous group of participants with different levels of expertise,  skill and background. During three sessions that were two days each, participants collectively inspected the space-time of computation and probed the universe of hardware-software separations through excursions, exercises and conversations. They tried out various perspectives and methods to look at the larger picture of software as a concept, as a practice, and as a set of techniques.\n\nThe first two days of The Techno-Galactic Software Observatory included visits to the Musée de l'Informatique Pionnière en Belgique [^]{http://www.nam-ip.be} in Namur and the Computermuseum KULeuven[^]{http://etwie.be/database/actor/computermuseum-ku-leuven}. Surrounded by these collections of historical ’numerical artefacts’, we started considering software in a long-term context (% CARLINSAYS: Do we mean a long historical context or longue duree or something else?). The museum visits provided an occasion to reflect on the conditions of software's appearance (% CARLINSAYS: appearances?) and to take on current-day questions from a genealogical perspective. What is software? How did it appear as a concept, in what industrial and governmental circumstances? What happens to the material conditions of its production (minerals, factory labor, hardware) when it evaporates into a cloud?\n\nThe second two days were spent focusing on the space-time dimension of IT development. The way computer programs and operating systems are manufactured has changed tremendously over the last seventy years, as has its production times and places. From military labs to the mega-corporation cubicles to the open-space freelancer utopia, what ruptures and continuities can be traced in the production, deployment, maintenance and destruction of software? From time-sharing to user-space partitions and containerization, what separations were and are at work? Where and when is software made today?\n\nThe last two days at the Techno-Galactic Software Observatory were dedicated to observation and its consequences. The development of software encompasses a series of practices whose evocative names are increasingly familiar: feedback, report, probe, audit, inspect, scan, diagnose, explore, test. What are the systems of knowledge and power within which these activities take place, and what other types of observation are possible? As a practical set for our investigations, we set up a walk-in clinic on the 25th floor of the World Trade Center, where users and developers could arrive with software-questions of all kinds.\n\n## The Walk-in Clinic (% CARLINSAYS: I think this title should go below the description of the walk-in clinic as the last two days of the observatory worksession and should come instead right above the invitation to the clinic so I have moved it there)\n\n> Do you suffer from the disappearance of your software into the cloud,\n> feel oppressed by unequal user privilege, or experience the torment of\n> software-ransom of any sort?\n> Bring your devices and interfaces to the World Trade Center!\n> With the help of a clear and in-depth session, at the Techno-Galactic\n> Walk-In Clinic we guarantee immediate results.\n> The  Walk-In Clinic provides free hands-on observations to software\n> curious  people of all kinds.

It also seems important to make sure that the two page list of services poster for the clinic is printed on pages that are facing each other. If they are already set to do that then maybe nix my suggestion of moving the intake form up, but if they are not then that would be one way to shift the pages to make that happen.)\n\n\n","attribs":"*0+n+1*7+3*0|2+2*7+2+2*6+1+8*6+1+6*6+1+8*6+1+8*6+1+a*6+1*7|2+2*6+2*7+1*6+5o|2+2+1q*0|1+1+1s*0|1+1+1p*0|1+1+18*6|1+1|3+3s*e+1*6+11*b|1+1*6+1r*0+1*e+b*6+1f*0+1*e+n*6+7*e+1*6+1g*e+1*6+3q*e+a*6+z*e+m*6+58*e|1+1*6|1+1*6+3d*e|1+1*6+2p*e+l*6+q*e+37*6+1*e+4g*6+3*e+g*6+c*e+2k*6+1*e+1t*6+c*e+58*6+r*e+1s*6+h*e+c*6+d*e+4*6+b*e+26*6+8*e+2*6+b*e+2*6+x*e+8*6+2*e+q*6+4*e+t*6+5*e+6*6+9*e|2+3g*6|1+1*6+2m*e|1+1*e+4v*6+8*e+1*6|5+1c9*9|1+1*6|5+1cs*6+5l*6*d+q*6+2d*9|1+1*6|3+4k*6*j+32*6|2+2*f|3+23*0*c+2*a*c+1p*a|1+1*0*c+2*a*c+1t*a|1+1*0*c+2*a*c+1y*a|1+1*0*c+2*a*c+1w*a|1+1*0*c+2*a*c+20*a|1+1*0*c+2*a*c+21*a|1+1*0*c+2*a*c+1s*a|1+1*0*c+2*a*c+1u*a|1+1*0*c+2*a*c+1w*a|1+1*0*c+2*a*c+1u*0|1+1*0*c+2*a*c+1y*a|1+1*0*c+2*a*c+1y*a|1+1*0*c+2*a*c+1y*a|1+1*0*c+2*a*c+v*f|1+1*f*1+v*f+1*a|1+1*0+2*a+1*a*c+1m*a|1+1*0*c+2*a*c+1t*a|1+1*0*c+2*a*c+1y*a|1+1*0*c+2*a*c+1y*f|1+1*f+1g*0+1*f|1+h*f+1s*0+1*f|1+5*f+z*0+1*f|1+y*f+11*0+1*f|7+bt|1+1+17*0|1+1|1+1+t*6+6+4s*0+1+1*0+1+1*0+b3*9+m*0+1+3w*6+b+11*6+1+3c*6+9+9*6+5|2+8y+3p*0+1+1*0+m+15*0+1o+2*6+d+1v*6+b+w*6+2g+2*6+h+1*6+8*9+3+16*6+a+b*6+x|2+88+m*6+h+35*6+4+l*6+4+2*6+l+3*6+5+1h*6+2|2+95+w*6+1+8*6+1+8*6+1+6s*6+2|1+95*6|2+72|1+1*0+2*1+1x*0|1+1*0+2*1+1y*0|1+1*0+2*1+s*0|1+1*0+2*1+1o*0|1+1*0+2*1+1x*0|1+1*0+2*1+1a|1+1*0+2*1+1v*0|1+1*0+2*1+1z*0|1+1*0+2*1+1z*0|1+1*0+2*1+21*0|1+1*0+2*1+1x*0|1+1*0+2*1+1t*0|1+1*0*1+2*1+1d*0|1+1*0+2*1+10*0|1+1*0+2*1+l|1+1*0+7+16*0+1|2+2*0+2+n*0|1+1*0+2+1j*7|1+1*0+2|1+1f*7|5+6h*7+1r*0|1+1*7|2+46*0|1+1*6+cs*a|1+1*6|1+1|1+1"}}},"pad:observatory.guide.introduction:revs:5201":{"changeset":"Z:bfl<1|l=26g=52-1$","meta":{"author":"a.EXnmpSWanmHBGv1u","timestamp":1520192911257}},"pad:observatory.guide.introduction:revs:5202":{"changeset":"Z:bfk<2|l=26g=50-2$","meta":{"author":"a.EXnmpSWanmHBGv1u","timestamp":1520192911752}},"pad:observatory.guide.introduction:revs:5203":{"changeset":"Z:bfi<3|l=26g=4x-3$","meta":{"author":"a.EXnmpSWanmHBGv1u","timestamp":1520192912258}},"pad:observatory.guide.introduction:revs:5204":{"changeset":"Z:bff<1|l=26g=4w-1$","meta":{"author":"a.EXnmpSWanmHBGv1u","timestamp":1520192913268}},"pad:observatory.guide.introduction:revs:5205":{"changeset":"Z:bfe>1|l=26g=4w*6+1$

witness, 1996 from: http://observatory.constantvzw.org/etherdump/friday.md.diff.html\n\n (%CARLINSAYS: Software is everywhere)\nA spectre is haunting the galaxy. It is neither revolutionary [@marx:1848:cmanifesto] nor is it a global scale vulnerability [@meltdown:2018:spectre17], but no matter where you happen to be, there is the spectre of a software running somewhere in the background. Look! There it is, looking right back at you. Be it your phone screen or a passing satellite, software's observation and entanglement in the everyday appears complete. But is it so total? Let's look again. (%CARLINSAYS: I think this makes more sense up here but I also wonder if we want to flip on the notion of completeness so quickly?)\n\n(%CARLINSAYS: Online services have radically altered software and reconfigured society. This is the why of this project.)\n We find ourselves in a universe built on a 1990s revival of a 1960s dream: software as a service [@haigh:2001:soft60]. In this online universe, the use of software has increasingly been knitted into the production of software, even while the rhetoric, rights, and procedures continue to suggest that use and production constitute separate realms. This knitting together and its corresponding disavowal radically alters the operative role of software in society. The shifts ripple across galaxies, through social structures, working conditions, and personal relations, resulting in a profusion of apparatuses that aspire to be seamless while optimizing and monetizing individual and collective flows of information in line with the interests of a handful of actors. The diffusion of software services affects individuals and communities in the form of intensified identity shaping and self-management, and affects the public, as institutions and common use infrastructures increasingly rely on \"solutions\" provided by private companies for their management. As online services increasingly centralize data flows in the clouds, they blur the last traces of the thin line separating bio- from necro-politics.\n(%CARLINSAYS:Tung Hui Hu The Prehistory of the Cloud https://mitpress.mit.edu/prehistory-cloud )\n\n(%CARLINSAYS: Given the state of things, what do we do? There are so many urgent questions...)\nGiven how software spins its web around us, our first reflex is to make an attempt to take a distance, only to realize that it is a gooey net in which we are already entangled. Caught upside down and dangling we ask: How can we interact, respond to, and think with software? What approaches can we use to recognize the agency of different actors, their ways of working, and their politics? What methods of observation are conducive to critical inquiry and affirmative discord? How can we resurface software, to find sites where its infrastructures are reconfiguring the everyday? How can we take stock of the ways software is always at work, especially where it is designed to disappear into the background?\n\nBowled over by these questions, by constant pop-ups and push notifications, we briefly fantasize about takithrowing our devices away, retreating to off the grid, and living software free lives. But the fantasy won't hold still. It keeps transforming into a picture of endless sitting around talking about past software troubles. We are in search of a better fantasy. One that lets us poke and push back. \n\nTogether, we picked up the word \"observation\", turning it over and around. We brought it right up to our noses and held it outstretched to get a better look, holding all of the histories of people looking at others and objects in mind, holding terminals (%CARLINSAYS: is this the right word?) and keyboards in hand. Observation, and the enabling of it through intensive data-centric feedback mechanisms, is part of the cybernetic spells that underpin present day software production. In this present moment, we sync our breath to the rhythm of our software and propose holistic observation as one way to enter an engagement with software's implications. Will you join us?\n\n(%CARLINSAYS: This guide is one answer to these questions, and it tickles.)\nThe Techno-Galactic Software Survival Guide (%CARLINSAYS: use agreed title) is an obsessive fantasy of optimization turned on its head, and stuck to the ceiling of a self-reflecting elevator. It is the ultimate book of dos and don'ts, of forgotten histories and un-inevitable futures, of mindful agile actions and improvisational service architectures, of any and all things that you can and cannot imagine needing in a techno-galaxy.  \n\nThis guide offers a set of practical and fantastical tools for the tactical (mis)use of software, empowering/enabling users to resist embedded paradigms and assumptions. It is a collection of methods for approaching software, experiencing its myths and realities, its risks and benefits. Drawing on theories of software and computation developed in academia and elsewhere, we grounded our methods in hands-on exercises and experiments that you now can try at home. This Guide to Techno-Galactic Software Observation (%CARLINSAYS: use agreed title) offers methods developed in and inspired by the context of software production, hacker culture, software studies, computer science research, Free Software communities, privacy activism, and artistic practice. It invites you to experiment with ways to stay with the trouble of software. We are techno-galactic as we meet thecontemporary paradigms of computation that proudly announce their capability for \"scaling up to the universe.\" We stand here as modest witnesses to the scales of software communities and related political economies that involve and require observation. Reading is not enough, software is not just a text, observation is one potential beginning, engagement is tickling. \n\nCan you call up that feeling of the approach of a touch that cannot be born with a straight face? Come join us at the edge of the universe, on the metro platform, at your kitchen table, as we mark and measure critical distances from and entanglements with the seemingly endless software systems that surround us.\n\n\nThe techno-galactic software survival guide (%CARLINSAYS: use agreed title) was collectively produced as an outcome of the Techno-Galactic Software Observatory. \n[This feels like it could be in a different font size or in brackets or is the start of the next page/spread?]\n\n\nkostas axelos, planetary interlude, maybe some bits fit with the intro?:\n\n%  We open ourselves to abysses and we are swallowed up in sys-\n%  tems and totalizations - for these are fragments and segments of\n%  \"totality\" which establish themselves as total and/or partial totali-\n%  tarisms - without foreseeing what might be the home, the house, the\n%  habitat of living, thinking man, an unfinished, unfinishable being in a\n%  history which is equally so, neither a shell stuck fast to a rock, nor a\n%  simple nomad or vagabond. Mortals wish for the familiar and for\n%  adventure, the known and the unknown, undecided as to who decides\n%  and to what he decides, chosen rather than choosing. Since they are\n%  unable to be their own master, they allow themselves to be fixed,\n%  tossed about, carried away, scattered and put to flight, incapable of\n%  choosing - if choice there be - between success in and in relation to\n%  the world, and the World. All this does not constitute an error; wan-\n%  dering (errance) commands it. \n Galactic irony is watching us. \n%  Dream of a shadow and dispenser of light, conquistador and\n%  deserter of the World, pawn and pioneer, man sets out to conquer\n%  the stars and he ploughs the sea. The assault he launches against the\n%  astral earth and against the celestial stars is not without disaster.\n Whether he delves into analysis and disintegration -- since he needs\n analyses, concrete and tangible solutions and experimentations -- or\n whether he plunges into syntheses -- since the abstracting power and\n the ungraspable attract him equally --, as precisely and as far as he\n may cast his nets, what his nets catch and what passes through them\n communicate. Never quite awake and never quite beclouded, will we\n learn to live and to see beings and things simultaneously from close\n up and far away, large and small, in their and in our wandering\n (errance), in the great World which is at the same time small, where\n there are no victors - would there be vanquished?\n\n## The Techno-Galactic Software Observatory\n\nIn the summer of 2017, thirty or so people gathered in Brussels to explore practices of proximate critique with and of software in the context of a worksession entitled \"Techno-Galactic Software Observatory\".[^]{Worksessions are intensive transdisciplinary moments, organised twice a year by Constant. They aim to provide conditions for participants with different experiences and capabilities to temporarily link their practice and to  develop ideas, prototypes and  research projects together. For the worksessions, primarily Free, Libre and Open Source software is used and material that is available under Open Content Licenses.} The worksession called for software-curious people of all kinds to ask questions about software. The intuition behind such a call was that developing different types of engagement requires a heterogeneous group of participants with different levels of expertise,  skill and background. During three sessions that were two days each, participants collectively inspected the space-time of computation and probed the universe of hardware-software separations through excursions, exercises and conversations. They tried out various perspectives and methods to look at the larger picture of software as a concept, as a practice, and as a set of techniques.\n\nThe first two days of The Techno-Galactic Software Observatory included visits to the Musée de l'Informatique Pionnière en Belgique [^]{http://www.nam-ip.be} in Namur and the Computermuseum KULeuven[^]{http://etwie.be/database/actor/computermuseum-ku-leuven}. Surrounded by these collections of historical ’numerical artefacts’, we started considering software in a long-term context (% CARLINSAYS: Do we mean a long historical context or longue duree or something else?). The museum visits provided an occasion to reflect on the conditions of software's appearance (% CARLINSAYS: appearances?) and to take on current-day questions from a genealogical perspective. What is software? How did it appear as a concept, in what industrial and governmental circumstances? What happens to the material conditions of its production (minerals, factory labor, hardware) when it evaporates into a cloud?\n\nThe second two days were spent focusing on the space-time dimension of IT development. The way computer programs and operating systems are manufactured has changed tremendously over the last seventy years, as has its production times and places. From military labs to the mega-corporation cubicles to the open-space freelancer utopia, what ruptures and continuities can be traced in the production, deployment, maintenance and destruction of software? From time-sharing to user-space partitions and containerization, what separations were and are at work? Where and when is software made today?\n\nThe last two days at the Techno-Galactic Software Observatory were dedicated to observation and its consequences. The development of software encompasses a series of practices whose evocative names are increasingly familiar: feedback, report, probe, audit, inspect, scan, diagnose, explore, test. What are the systems of knowledge and power within which these activities take place, and what other types of observation are possible? As a practical set for our investigations, we set up a walk-in clinic on the 25th floor of the World Trade Center, where users and developers could arrive with software-questions of all kinds.\n\n## The Walk-in Clinic (% CARLINSAYS: I think this title should go below the description of the walk-in clinic as the last two days of the observatory worksession and should come instead right above the invitation to the clinic so I have moved it there)\n\n> Do you suffer from the disappearance of your software into the cloud,\n> feel oppressed by unequal user privilege, or experience the torment of\n> software-ransom of any sort?\n> Bring your devices and interfaces to the World Trade Center!\n> With the help of a clear and in-depth session, at the Techno-Galactic\n> Walk-In Clinic we guarantee immediate results.\n> The  Walk-In Clinic provides free hands-on observations to software\n> curious  people of all kinds.

It also seems important to make sure that the two page list of services poster for the clinic is printed on pages that are facing each other. If they are already set to do that then maybe nix my suggestion of moving the intake form up, but if they are not then that would be one way to shift the pages to make that happen.)\n\n\n","attribs":"*0+n+1*7+3*0|2+2*7+2+2*6+1+8*6+1+6*6+1+8*6+1+8*6+1+a*6+1*7|2+2*6+2*7+1*6+5o|2+2+1q*0|1+1+1s*0|1+1+1p*0|1+1+18*6|1+1|3+3s*e+1*6+11*b|1+1*6+1r*0+1*e+b*6+1f*0+1*e+n*6+7*e+1*6+1g*e+1*6+3q*e+a*6+z*e+m*6+58*e|1+1*6|1+1*6+3d*e|1+1*6+2p*e+l*6+q*e+37*6+1*e+4g*6+3*e+g*6+c*e+2k*6+1*e+1t*6+c*e+58*6+r*e+1s*6+h*e+c*6+d*e+4*6+b*e+26*6+8*e+2*6+b*e+2*6+x*e+8*6+2*e+q*6+4*e+t*6+5*e+6*6+9*e|2+3g*6|1+1*6+2m*e|1+1*e+4v*6+15*e+1*6|5+17m*9|1+1*6|5+1cs*6+5l*6*d+q*6+2d*9|1+1*6|3+4k*6*j+32*6|2+2*f|3+23*0*c+2*a*c+1p*a|1+1*0*c+2*a*c+1t*a|1+1*0*c+2*a*c+1y*a|1+1*0*c+2*a*c+1w*a|1+1*0*c+2*a*c+20*a|1+1*0*c+2*a*c+21*a|1+1*0*c+2*a*c+1s*a|1+1*0*c+2*a*c+1u*a|1+1*0*c+2*a*c+1w*a|1+1*0*c+2*a*c+1u*0|1+1*0*c+2*a*c+1y*a|1+1*0*c+2*a*c+1y*a|1+1*0*c+2*a*c+1y*a|1+1*0*c+2*a*c+v*f|1+1*f*1+v*f+1*a|1+1*0+2*a+1*a*c+1m*a|1+1*0*c+2*a*c+1t*a|1+1*0*c+2*a*c+1y*a|1+1*0*c+2*a*c+1y*f|1+1*f+1g*0+1*f|1+h*f+1s*0+1*f|1+5*f+z*0+1*f|1+y*f+11*0+1*f|7+bt|1+1+17*0|1+1|1+1+t*6+6+4s*0+1+1*0+1+1*0+b3*9+m*0+1+3w*6+b+11*6+1+3c*6+9+9*6+5|2+8y+3p*0+1+1*0+m+15*0+1o+2*6+d+1v*6+b+w*6+2g+2*6+h+1*6+8*9+3+16*6+a+b*6+x|2+88+m*6+h+35*6+4+l*6+4+2*6+l+3*6+5+1h*6+2|2+95+w*6+1+8*6+1+8*6+1+6s*6+2|1+95*6|2+72|1+1*0+2*1+1x*0|1+1*0+2*1+1y*0|1+1*0+2*1+s*0|1+1*0+2*1+1o*0|1+1*0+2*1+1x*0|1+1*0+2*1+1a|1+1*0+2*1+1v*0|1+1*0+2*1+1z*0|1+1*0+2*1+1z*0|1+1*0+2*1+21*0|1+1*0+2*1+1x*0|1+1*0+2*1+1t*0|1+1*0*1+2*1+1d*0|1+1*0+2*1+10*0|1+1*0+2*1+l|1+1*0+7+16*0+1|2+2*0+2+n*0|1+1*0+2+1j*7|1+1*0+2|1+1f*7|5+6h*7+1r*0|1+1*7|2+46*0|1+1*6+cs*a|1+1*6|1+1|1+1"}}},"pad:observatory.guide.introduction:revs:5301":{"changeset":"Z:bbv<2|n=2q5=2x-2$","meta":{"author":"a.EXnmpSWanmHBGv1u","timestamp":1520193573385}},"pad:observatory.guide.introduction:revs:5302":{"changeset":"Z:bbt>1|n=2q5=2x*6+1$k","meta":{"author":"a.EXnmpSWanmHBGv1u","timestamp":1520193573920}},"pad:observatory.guide.introduction:revs:5303":{"changeset":"Z:bbu>3|n=2q5=2y*6+3$ing","meta":{"author":"a.EXnmpSWanmHBGv1u","timestamp":1520193574418}},"pad:observatory.guide.introduction:revs:5304":{"changeset":"Z:bbx>2|n=2q5=31*6+2$

witness, 1996 from: http://observatory.constantvzw.org/etherdump/friday.md.diff.html\n\n (%CARLINSAYS: Software is everywhere)\nA spectre is haunting the galaxy. It is neither revolutionary [@marx:1848:cmanifesto] nor is it a global scale vulnerability [@meltdown:2018:spectre17], but no matter where you happen to be, there is the spectre of a software running somewhere in the background. Look! There it is, looking right back at you. Be it your phone screen or a passing satellite, software's observation and entanglement in the everyday appears complete. But is it so total? Let's look again. (%CARLINSAYS: I think this makes more sense up here but I also wonder if we want to flip on the notion of completeness so quickly?)\n\n(%CARLINSAYS: Online services have radically altered software and reconfigured society. This is the why of this project.)\n We find ourselves in a universe built on a 1990s revival of a 1960s dream: software as a service [@haigh:2001:soft60]. In this online universe, the use of software has increasingly been knitted into the production of software, even while the rhetoric, rights, and procedures continue to suggest that use and production constitute separate realms. This knitting together and its corresponding disavowal radically alters the operative role of software in society. The shifts ripple across galaxies, through social structures, working conditions, and personal relations, resulting in a profusion of apparatuses that aspire to be seamless while optimizing and monetizing individual and collective flows of information in line with the interests of a handful of actors. The diffusion of software services affects individuals and communities in the form of intensified identity shaping and self-management, and affects the public, as institutions and common use infrastructures increasingly rely on \"solutions\" provided by private companies for their management. As online services increasingly centralize data flows in the clouds, they blur the last traces of the thin line separating bio- from necro-politics.\n(%CARLINSAYS:Tung Hui Hu The Prehistory of the Cloud https://mitpress.mit.edu/prehistory-cloud )\n\n(%CARLINSAYS: Given the state of things, what do we do? There are so many urgent questions...)\nGiven how software spins its web around us, our first reflex is to make an attempt to take a distance, only to realize that it is a gooey net in which we are already entangled. Caught upside down and dangling we ask: How can we interact, respond to, and think with software? What approaches can we use to recognize the agency of different actors, their ways of working, and their politics? What methods of observation are conducive to critical inquiry and affirmative discord? How can we resurface software, to find sites where its infrastructures are reconfiguring the everyday? How can we take stock of the ways software is always at work, especially where it is designed to disappear into the background?\n\nBowled over by these questions, by constant pop-ups and push notifications, a fantasy of taking a sledge hammer to our devices, throwing them in the river, retreating off grid and out of sight, and living software free lives takes shape. But it is a fantasy that won't hold still. We are in search of a better fantasy,. One that lets us poke and push back. \n\nTogether, we picked up the word \"observation\", turning it over and around. We brought it right up to our noses and held it outstretched to get a better look, holding all of the histories of people looking at others and objects in mind, holding terminals (%CARLINSAYS: is this the right word?) and keyboards in hand. Observation, and the enabling of it through intensive data-centric feedback mechanisms, is part of the cybernetic spells that underpin present day software production. In this present moment, we sync our breath to the rhythm of our software and propose holistic observation as one way to enter an engagement with software's implications. Will you join us?\n\n(%CARLINSAYS: This guide is one answer to these questions, and it tickles.)\nThe Techno-Galactic Software Survival Guide (%CARLINSAYS: use agreed title) is an obsessive fantasy of optimization turned on its head, and stuck to the ceiling of a self-reflecting elevator. It is the ultimate book of dos and don'ts, of forgotten histories and un-inevitable futures, of mindful agile actions and improvisational service architectures, of any and all things that you can and cannot imagine needing in a techno-galaxy.  \n\nThis guide offers a set of practical and fantastical tools for the tactical (mis)use of software, empowering/enabling users to resist embedded paradigms and assumptions. It is a collection of methods for approaching software, experiencing its myths and realities, its risks and benefits. Drawing on theories of software and computation developed in academia and elsewhere, we grounded our methods in hands-on exercises and experiments that you now can try at home. This Guide to Techno-Galactic Software Observation (%CARLINSAYS: use agreed title) offers methods developed in and inspired by the context of software production, hacker culture, software studies, computer science research, Free Software communities, privacy activism, and artistic practice. It invites you to experiment with ways to stay with the trouble of software. We are techno-galactic as we meet thecontemporary paradigms of computation that proudly announce their capability for \"scaling up to the universe.\" We stand here as modest witnesses to the scales of software communities and related political economies that involve and require observation. Reading is not enough, software is not just a text, observation is one potential beginning, engagement is tickling. \n\nCan you call up that feeling of the approach of a touch that cannot be born with a straight face? Come join us at the edge of the universe, on the metro platform, at your kitchen table, as we mark and measure critical distances from and entanglements with the seemingly endless software systems that surround us.\n\n\nThe techno-galactic software survival guide (%CARLINSAYS: use agreed title) was collectively produced as an outcome of the Techno-Galactic Software Observatory. \n[This feels like it could be in a different font size or in brackets or is the start of the next page/spread?]\n\n\nkostas axelos, planetary interlude, maybe some bits fit with the intro?:\n\n%  We open ourselves to abysses and we are swallowed up in sys-\n%  tems and totalizations - for these are fragments and segments of\n%  \"totality\" which establish themselves as total and/or partial totali-\n%  tarisms - without foreseeing what might be the home, the house, the\n%  habitat of living, thinking man, an unfinished, unfinishable being in a\n%  history which is equally so, neither a shell stuck fast to a rock, nor a\n%  simple nomad or vagabond. Mortals wish for the familiar and for\n%  adventure, the known and the unknown, undecided as to who decides\n%  and to what he decides, chosen rather than choosing. Since they are\n%  unable to be their own master, they allow themselves to be fixed,\n%  tossed about, carried away, scattered and put to flight, incapable of\n%  choosing - if choice there be - between success in and in relation to\n%  the world, and the World. All this does not constitute an error; wan-\n%  dering (errance) commands it. \n Galactic irony is watching us. \n%  Dream of a shadow and dispenser of light, conquistador and\n%  deserter of the World, pawn and pioneer, man sets out to conquer\n%  the stars and he ploughs the sea. The assault he launches against the\n%  astral earth and against the celestial stars is not without disaster.\n Whether he delves into analysis and disintegration -- since he needs\n analyses, concrete and tangible solutions and experimentations -- or\n whether he plunges into syntheses -- since the abstracting power and\n the ungraspable attract him equally --, as precisely and as far as he\n may cast his nets, what his nets catch and what passes through them\n communicate. Never quite awake and never quite beclouded, will we\n learn to live and to see beings and things simultaneously from close\n up and far away, large and small, in their and in our wandering\n (errance), in the great World which is at the same time small, where\n there are no victors - would there be vanquished?\n\n## The Techno-Galactic Software Observatory\n\nIn the summer of 2017, thirty or so people gathered in Brussels to explore practices of proximate critique with and of software in the context of a worksession entitled \"Techno-Galactic Software Observatory\".[^]{Worksessions are intensive transdisciplinary moments, organised twice a year by Constant. They aim to provide conditions for participants with different experiences and capabilities to temporarily link their practice and to  develop ideas, prototypes and  research projects together. For the worksessions, primarily Free, Libre and Open Source software is used and material that is available under Open Content Licenses.} The worksession called for software-curious people of all kinds to ask questions about software. The intuition behind such a call was that developing different types of engagement requires a heterogeneous group of participants with different levels of expertise,  skill and background. During three sessions that were two days each, participants collectively inspected the space-time of computation and probed the universe of hardware-software separations through excursions, exercises and conversations. They tried out various perspectives and methods to look at the larger picture of software as a concept, as a practice, and as a set of techniques.\n\nThe first two days of The Techno-Galactic Software Observatory included visits to the Musée de l'Informatique Pionnière en Belgique [^]{http://www.nam-ip.be} in Namur and the Computermuseum KULeuven[^]{http://etwie.be/database/actor/computermuseum-ku-leuven}. Surrounded by these collections of historical ’numerical artefacts’, we started considering software in a long-term context (% CARLINSAYS: Do we mean a long historical context or longue duree or something else?). The museum visits provided an occasion to reflect on the conditions of software's appearance (% CARLINSAYS: appearances?) and to take on current-day questions from a genealogical perspective. What is software? How did it appear as a concept, in what industrial and governmental circumstances? What happens to the material conditions of its production (minerals, factory labor, hardware) when it evaporates into a cloud?\n\nThe second two days were spent focusing on the space-time dimension of IT development. The way computer programs and operating systems are manufactured has changed tremendously over the last seventy years, as has its production times and places. From military labs to the mega-corporation cubicles to the open-space freelancer utopia, what ruptures and continuities can be traced in the production, deployment, maintenance and destruction of software? From time-sharing to user-space partitions and containerization, what separations were and are at work? Where and when is software made today?\n\nThe last two days at the Techno-Galactic Software Observatory were dedicated to observation and its consequences. The development of software encompasses a series of practices whose evocative names are increasingly familiar: feedback, report, probe, audit, inspect, scan, diagnose, explore, test. What are the systems of knowledge and power within which these activities take place, and what other types of observation are possible? As a practical set for our investigations, we set up a walk-in clinic on the 25th floor of the World Trade Center, where users and developers could arrive with software-questions of all kinds.\n\n## The Walk-in Clinic (% CARLINSAYS: I think this title should go below the description of the walk-in clinic as the last two days of the observatory worksession and should come instead right above the invitation to the clinic so I have moved it there)\n\n> Do you suffer from the disappearance of your software into the cloud,\n> feel oppressed by unequal user privilege, or experience the torment of\n> software-ransom of any sort?\n> Bring your devices and interfaces to the World Trade Center!\n> With the help of a clear and in-depth session, at the Techno-Galactic\n> Walk-In Clinic we guarantee immediate results.\n> The  Walk-In Clinic provides free hands-on observations to software\n> curious  people of all kinds.

witness, 1996 from: http://observatory.constantvzw.org/etherdump/friday.md.diff.html\n\n (%CARLINSAYS: Software is everywhere)\nA spectre is haunting the galaxy. It is neither revolutionary [@marx:1848:cmanifesto] nor is it a global scale vulnerability [@meltdown:2018:spectre17], but no matter where you happen to be, there is the spectre of a software running somewhere in the background. Look! There it is, looking right back at you. Be it your phone screen or a passing satellite, software's observation and entanglement in the everyday appears complete. But is it so total? Let's look again. (%CARLINSAYS: I think this makes more sense up here but I also wonder if we want to flip on the notion of completeness so quickly?)\n\n(%CARLINSAYS: Online services have radically altered software and reconfigured society. This is the why of this project.)\n We find ourselves in a universe built on a 1990s revival of a 1960s dream: software as a service [@haigh:2001:soft60]. In this online universe, the use of software has increasingly been knitted into the production of software, even while the rhetoric, rights, and procedures continue to suggest that use and production constitute separate realms. This knitting together and its corresponding disavowal radically alters the operative role of software in society. The shifts ripple across galaxies, through social structures, working conditions, and personal relations, resulting in a profusion of apparatuses that aspire to be seamless while optimizing and monetizing individual and collective flows of information in line with the interests of a handful of actors. The diffusion of software services affects individuals and communities in the form of intensified identity shaping and self-management, and affects the public, as institutions and common use infrastructures increasingly rely on \"solutions\" provided by private companies for their management. As online services increasingly centralize data flows in the clouds, they blur the last traces of the thin line separating bio- from necro-politics.\n(%CARLINSAYS:Tung Hui Hu The Prehistory of the Cloud https://mitpress.mit.edu/prehistory-cloud )\n\n(%CARLINSAYS: Given the state of things, what do we do? There are so many urgent questions...)\nGiven how software spins its web around us, our first reflex is to make an attempt to take a distance, only to realize that it is a gooey net in which we are already entangled. Caught upside down and dangling we ask: How can we interact, respond to, and think with software? What approaches can we use to recognize the agency of different actors, their ways of working, and their politics? What methods of observation are conducive to critical inquiry and affirmative discord? How can we resurface software, to find sites where its infrastructures are reconfiguring the everyday? How can we take stock of the ways software is always at work, especially where it is designed to disappear into the background?\n\nBowled over by these questions, by constant pop-ups and push notifications, a fantasy of taking a sledge hammer to our devices, throwing them in the river, retreating off grid and out of sight, and living software free lives takes shape. But it is a fantasy that won't hold still. We are in search of a better fantasy. One that lets us poke and push back. \nA fantasy that is maybe available to the tech-biilionaires, the poorest of our planet and to those having tantrum we fear is not going to do it.\n\nTogether, we picked up the word \"observation\", turning it over and around. We brought it right up to our noses and held it outstretched to get a better look, holding all of the histories of people looking at others and objects in mind, holding terminals (%CARLINSAYS: is this the right word?) and keyboards in hand. Observation, and the enabling of it through intensive data-centric feedback mechanisms, is part of the cybernetic spells that underpin present day software production. In this present moment, we sync our breath to the rhythm of our software and propose holistic observation as one way to enter an engagement with software's implications. Will you join us?\n\n(%CARLINSAYS: This guide is one answer to these questions, and it tickles.)\nThe Techno-Galactic Software Survival Guide (%CARLINSAYS: use agreed title) is an obsessive fantasy of optimization turned on its head, and stuck to the ceiling of a self-reflecting elevator. It is the ultimate book of dos and don'ts, of forgotten histories and un-inevitable futures, of mindful agile actions and improvisational service architectures, of any and all things that you can and cannot imagine needing in a techno-galaxy.  \n\nThis guide offers a set of practical and fantastical tools for the tactical (mis)use of software, empowering/enabling users to resist embedded paradigms and assumptions. It is a collection of methods for approaching software, experiencing its myths and realities, its risks and benefits. Drawing on theories of software and computation developed in academia and elsewhere, we grounded our methods in hands-on exercises and experiments that you now can try at home. This Guide to Techno-Galactic Software Observation (%CARLINSAYS: use agreed title) offers methods developed in and inspired by the context of software production, hacker culture, software studies, computer science research, Free Software communities, privacy activism, and artistic practice. It invites you to experiment with ways to stay with the trouble of software. We are techno-galactic as we meet thecontemporary paradigms of computation that proudly announce their capability for \"scaling up to the universe.\" We stand here as modest witnesses to the scales of software communities and related political economies that involve and require observation. Reading is not enough, software is not just a text, observation is one potential beginning, engagement is tickling. \n\nCan you call up that feeling of the approach of a touch that cannot be born with a straight face? Come join us at the edge of the universe, on the metro platform, at your kitchen table, as we mark and measure critical distances from and entanglements with the seemingly endless software systems that surround us.\n\n\nThe techno-galactic software survival guide (%CARLINSAYS: use agreed title) was collectively produced as an outcome of the Techno-Galactic Software Observatory. \n[This feels like it could be in a different font size or in brackets or is the start of the next page/spread?]\n\n\nkostas axelos, planetary interlude, maybe some bits fit with the intro?:\n\n%  We open ourselves to abysses and we are swallowed up in sys-\n%  tems and totalizations - for these are fragments and segments of\n%  \"totality\" which establish themselves as total and/or partial totali-\n%  tarisms - without foreseeing what might be the home, the house, the\n%  habitat of living, thinking man, an unfinished, unfinishable being in a\n%  history which is equally so, neither a shell stuck fast to a rock, nor a\n%  simple nomad or vagabond. Mortals wish for the familiar and for\n%  adventure, the known and the unknown, undecided as to who decides\n%  and to what he decides, chosen rather than choosing. Since they are\n%  unable to be their own master, they allow themselves to be fixed,\n%  tossed about, carried away, scattered and put to flight, incapable of\n%  choosing - if choice there be - between success in and in relation to\n%  the world, and the World. All this does not constitute an error; wan-\n%  dering (errance) commands it. \n Galactic irony is watching us. \n%  Dream of a shadow and dispenser of light, conquistador and\n%  deserter of the World, pawn and pioneer, man sets out to conquer\n%  the stars and he ploughs the sea. The assault he launches against the\n%  astral earth and against the celestial stars is not without disaster.\n Whether he delves into analysis and disintegration -- since he needs\n analyses, concrete and tangible solutions and experimentations -- or\n whether he plunges into syntheses -- since the abstracting power and\n the ungraspable attract him equally --, as precisely and as far as he\n may cast his nets, what his nets catch and what passes through them\n communicate. Never quite awake and never quite beclouded, will we\n learn to live and to see beings and things simultaneously from close\n up and far away, large and small, in their and in our wandering\n (errance), in the great World which is at the same time small, where\n there are no victors - would there be vanquished?\n\n## The Techno-Galactic Software Observatory\n\nIn the summer of 2017, thirty or so people gathered in Brussels to explore practices of proximate critique with and of software in the context of a worksession entitled \"Techno-Galactic Software Observatory\".[^]{Worksessions are intensive transdisciplinary moments, organised twice a year by Constant. They aim to provide conditions for participants with different experiences and capabilities to temporarily link their practice and to  develop ideas, prototypes and  research projects together. For the worksessions, primarily Free, Libre and Open Source software is used and material that is available under Open Content Licenses.} The worksession called for software-curious people of all kinds to ask questions about software. The intuition behind such a call was that developing different types of engagement requires a heterogeneous group of participants with different levels of expertise,  skill and background. During three sessions that were two days each, participants collectively inspected the space-time of computation and probed the universe of hardware-software separations through excursions, exercises and conversations. They tried out various perspectives and methods to look at the larger picture of software as a concept, as a practice, and as a set of techniques.\n\nThe first two days of The Techno-Galactic Software Observatory included visits to the Musée de l'Informatique Pionnière en Belgique [^]{http://www.nam-ip.be} in Namur and the Computermuseum KULeuven[^]{http://etwie.be/database/actor/computermuseum-ku-leuven}. Surrounded by these collections of historical ’numerical artefacts’, we started considering software in a long-term context (% CARLINSAYS: Do we mean a long historical context or longue duree or something else?). The museum visits provided an occasion to reflect on the conditions of software's appearance (% CARLINSAYS: appearances?) and to take on current-day questions from a genealogical perspective. What is software? How did it appear as a concept, in what industrial and governmental circumstances? What happens to the material conditions of its production (minerals, factory labor, hardware) when it evaporates into a cloud?\n\nThe second two days were spent focusing on the space-time dimension of IT development. The way computer programs and operating systems are manufactured has changed tremendously over the last seventy years, as has its production times and places. From military labs to the mega-corporation cubicles to the open-space freelancer utopia, what ruptures and continuities can be traced in the production, deployment, maintenance and destruction of software? From time-sharing to user-space partitions and containerization, what separations were and are at work? Where and when is software made today?\n\nThe last two days at the Techno-Galactic Software Observatory were dedicated to observation and its consequences. The development of software encompasses a series of practices whose evocative names are increasingly familiar: feedback, report, probe, audit, inspect, scan, diagnose, explore, test. What are the systems of knowledge and power within which these activities take place, and what other types of observation are possible? As a practical set for our investigations, we set up a walk-in clinic on the 25th floor of the World Trade Center, where users and developers could arrive with software-questions of all kinds.\n\n## The Walk-in Clinic (% CARLINSAYS: I think this title should go below the description of the walk-in clinic as the last two days of the observatory worksession and should come instead right above the invitation to the clinic so I have moved it there)\n\n> Do you suffer from the disappearance of your software into the cloud,\n> feel oppressed by unequal user privilege, or experience the torment of\n> software-ransom of any sort?\n> Bring your devices and interfaces to the World Trade Center!\n> With the help of a clear and in-depth session, at the Techno-Galactic\n> Walk-In Clinic we guarantee immediate results.\n> The  Walk-In Clinic provides free hands-on observations to software\n> curious  people of all kinds.

It also seems important to make sure that the two page list of services poster for the clinic is printed on pages that are facing each other. If they are already set to do that then maybe nix my suggestion of moving the intake form up, but if they are not then that would be one way to shift the pages to make that

everywhere)\nA spectre is haunting the galaxy. It is neither revolutionary [@marx:1848:cmanifesto] nor is it a global scale vulnerability [@meltdown:2018:spectre17], but no matter where you happen to be, there is the spectre of a software running somewhere in the background. Look! There it is, looking right back at you. Be it your phone screen or a passing satellite, software's observation and entanglement in the everyday appears complete. But is it so total? Let's look again. (%CARLINSAYS: I think this makes more sense up here but I also wonder if we want to flip on the notion of completeness so quickly?)\n\n(%CARLINSAYS: Online services have radically altered software and reconfigured society. This is the why of this project.)\n We find ourselves in a universe built on a 1990s revival of a 1960s dream: software as a service [@haigh:2001:soft60]. In this online universe, the use of software has increasingly been knitted into the production of software, even while the rhetoric, rights, and procedures continue to suggest that use and production constitute separate realms. This knitting together and its corresponding disavowal radically alters the operative role of software in society. The shifts ripple across galaxies, through social structures, working conditions, and personal relations, resulting in a profusion of apparatuses that aspire to be seamless while optimizing and monetizing individual and collective flows of information in line with the interests of a handful of actors. The diffusion of software services affects individuals and communities in the form of intensified identity shaping and self-management, and affects the public, as institutions and common use infrastructures increasingly rely on \"solutions\" provided by private companies for their management. As online services increasingly centralize data flows in the clouds, they blur the last traces of the thin line separating bio- from necro-politics.\n(%CARLINSAYS:Tung Hui Hu The Prehistory of the Cloud https://mitpress.mit.edu/prehistory-cloud )\n\n(%CARLINSAYS: Given the state of things, what do we do? There are so many urgent questions...)\nGiven how software spins its web around us, our first reflex is to make an attempt to take a distance, only to realize that it is a gooey net in which we are already entangled. Caught upside down and dangling we ask: How can we interact, respond to, and think with software? What approaches can we use to recognize the agency of different actors, their ways of working, and their politics? What methods of observation are conducive to critical inquiry and affirmative discord? How can we resurface software, to find sites where its infrastructures are reconfiguring the everyday? How can we take stock of the ways software is always at work, especially where it is designed to disappear into the background?\n\nBowled over by these questions, by constant pop-ups and push notifications, a fantasy takes shape. \nTaking a sledge hammer to our devices, throwing them in the river, retreating off grid and out of sight, and living software free lives. But it is a fantasy that won't hold still. \nA fantasy that is maybe available to the tech-biilionaires, the poorest of our planet and to those having an unexpected tantrum we fear is not going to do it.\nWe are in search of a better fantasy. One that lets us poke and push back. \n\n\nTogether, we picked up the word \"observation\", turning it over and around. We brought it right up to our noses and held it outstretched to get a better look, holding all of the histories of people looking at others and objects in mind, holding terminals (%CARLINSAYS: is this the right word?) and keyboards in hand. Observation, and the enabling of it through intensive data-centric feedback mechanisms, is part of the cybernetic spells that underpin present day software production. In this present moment, we sync our breath to the rhythm of our software and propose holistic observation as one way to enter an engagement with software's implications. Will you join us?\n\n(%CARLINSAYS: This guide is one answer to these questions, and it tickles.)\nThe Techno-Galactic Software Survival Guide (%CARLINSAYS: use agreed title) is an obsessive fantasy of optimization turned on its head, and stuck to the ceiling of a self-reflecting elevator. It is the ultimate book of dos and don'ts, of forgotten histories and un-inevitable futures, of mindful agile actions and improvisational service architectures, of any and all things that you can and cannot imagine needing in a techno-galaxy.  \n\nThis guide offers a set of practical and fantastical tools for the tactical (mis)use of software, empowering/enabling users to resist embedded paradigms and assumptions. It is a collection of methods for approaching software, experiencing its myths and realities, its risks and benefits. Drawing on theories of software and computation developed in academia and elsewhere, (%CARLINSAYS: BUMP, maybe introduce the event and us here so that it is clear who the \"we\" is here... At TGSO we de) we grounded our methods in hands-on exercises and experiments that you now can try at home. This Guide to Techno-Galactic Software Observation (%CARLINSAYS: use agreed title) offers methods developed in and inspired by the context of software production, hacker culture, software studies, computer science research, Free Software communities, privacy activism, and artistic practice. It invites you to experiment with ways to stay with the trouble of software. We are techno-galactic as we meet the contemporary paradigms of computation that proudly announce their capability for \"scaling up to the universe.\" We stand here as modest witnesses to the scales of software communities and related political economies that involve and require observation. Reading is not enough, software is not just a text, observation is one potential beginning, engagement is tickling. \n\nCan you call up that feeling of the approach of a touch that cannot be born with a straight face? Come join us at the edge of the universe, on the metro platform, at your kitchen table, as we mark and measure critical distances from and entanglements with the seemingly endless software systems that surround us.\n\n\nThe techno-galactic software survival guide (%CARLINSAYS: use agreed title) was collectively produced as an outcome of the Techno-Galactic Software Observatory. \n[This feels like it could be in a different font size or in brackets or is the start of the next page/spread?]\n\n\nkostas axelos, planetary interlude, maybe some bits fit with the intro?:\n\n%  We open ourselves to abysses and we are swallowed up in sys-\n%  tems and totalizations - for these are fragments and segments of\n%  \"totality\" which establish themselves as total and/or partial totali-\n%  tarisms - without foreseeing what might be the home, the house, the\n%  habitat of living, thinking man, an unfinished, unfinishable being in a\n%  history which is equally so, neither a shell stuck fast to a rock, nor a\n%  simple nomad or vagabond. Mortals wish for the familiar and for\n%  adventure, the known and the unknown, undecided as to who decides\n%  and to what he decides, chosen rather than choosing. Since they are\n%  unable to be their own master, they allow themselves to be fixed,\n%  tossed about, carried away, scattered and put to flight, incapable of\n%  choosing - if choice there be - between success in and in relation to\n%  the world, and the World. All this does not constitute an error; wan-\n%  dering (errance) commands it. \n Galactic irony is watching us. \n%  Dream of a shadow and dispenser of light, conquistador and\n%  deserter of the World, pawn and pioneer, man sets out to conquer\n%  the stars and he ploughs the sea. The assault he launches against the\n%  astral earth and against the celestial stars is not without disaster.\n Whether he delves into analysis and disintegration -- since he needs\n analyses, concrete and tangible solutions and experimentations -- or\n whether he plunges into syntheses -- since the abstracting power and\n the ungraspable attract him equally --, as precisely and as far as he\n may cast his nets, what his nets catch and what passes through them\n communicate. Never quite awake and never quite beclouded, will we\n learn to live and to see beings and things simultaneously from close\n up and far away, large and small, in their and in our wandering\n (errance), in the great World which is at the same time small, where\n there are no victors - would there be vanquished?\n\n## The Techno-Galactic Software Observatory\n\nIn the summer of 2017, thirty or so people gathered in Brussels to explore practices of proximate critique with and of software in the context of a worksession entitled \"Techno-Galactic Software Observatory\".[^]{Worksessions are intensive transdisciplinary moments, organised twice a year by Constant. They aim to provide conditions for participants with different experiences and capabilities to temporarily link their practice and to  develop ideas, prototypes and  research projects together. For the worksessions, primarily Free, Libre and Open Source software is used and material that is available under Open Content Licenses.} The worksession called for software-curious people of all kinds to ask questions about software. The intuition behind such a call was that developing different types of engagement requires a heterogeneous group of participants with different levels of expertise,  skill and background. During three sessions that were two days each, participants collectively inspected the space-time of computation and probed the universe of hardware-software separations through excursions, exercises and conversations. They tried out various perspectives and methods to look at the larger picture of software as a concept, as a practice, and as a set of techniques.\n\nThe first two days of The Techno-Galactic Software Observatory included visits to the Musée de l'Informatique Pionnière en Belgique [^]{http://www.nam-ip.be} in Namur and the Computermuseum KULeuven[^]{http://etwie.be/database/actor/computermuseum-ku-leuven}. Surrounded by these collections of historical ’numerical artefacts’, we started considering software in a long-term context (% CARLINSAYS: Do we mean a long historical context or longue duree or something else?). The museum visits provided an occasion to reflect on the conditions of software's appearance (% CARLINSAYS: appearances?) and to take on current-day questions from a genealogical perspective. What is software? How did it appear as a concept, in what industrial and governmental circumstances? What happens to the material conditions of its production (minerals, factory labor, hardware) when it evaporates into a cloud?\n\nThe second two days were spent focusing on the space-time dimension of IT development. The way computer programs and operating systems are manufactured has changed tremendously over the last seventy years, as has its production times and places. From military labs to the mega-corporation cubicles to the open-space freelancer utopia, what ruptures and continuities can be traced in the production, deployment, maintenance and destruction of software? From time-sharing to user-space partitions and containerization, what separations were and are at work? Where and when is software made today?\n\nThe last two days at the Techno-Galactic Software Observatory were dedicated to observation and its consequences. The development of software encompasses a series of practices whose evocative names are increasingly familiar: feedback, report, probe, audit, inspect, scan, diagnose, explore, test. What are the systems of knowledge and power within which these activities take place, and what other types of observation are possible? As a practical set for our investigations, we set up a walk-in clinic on the 25th floor of the World Trade Center, where users and developers could arrive with software-questions of all kinds.\n\n## The Walk-in Clinic (% CARLINSAYS: I think this title should go below the description of the walk-in clinic as the last two days of the observatory worksession and should come instead right above the invitation to the clinic so I have moved it there)\n\n> Do you suffer from the disappearance of your software into the cloud,\n> feel oppressed by unequal user privilege, or experience the torment of\n> software-ransom of any sort?\n> Bring your devices and interfaces to the World Trade Center!\n> With the help of a clear and in-depth session, at the Techno-Galactic\n> Walk-In Clinic we guarantee immediate results.\n> The  Walk-In Clinic provides free hands-on observations to software\n> curious  people of all kinds.

It also seems important to make sure that the two page list of services poster for the clinic is printed on pages that are facing each other. If they are already set to do that then maybe nix my suggestion of moving the intake form up, but if they are not then that would be one way to shift the pages to make that happen.)\n\n\n","attribs":"*0+n+1*7+3*0|2+2*7+2+2*6+1+8*6+1+6*6+1+8*6+1+8*6+1+a*6+1*7|2+2*6+2*7+1*6+5o|2+2+1q*0|1+1+1s*0|1+1+1p*0|1+1+18*6|1+1|3+3s*e+1*6+11*b|1+1*6+1r*0+1*e+b*6+1f*0+1*e+n*6+7*e+1*6+1g*e+1*6+3q*e+a*6+z*e+m*6+58*e|1+1*6|1+1*6+3d*e|1+1*6+2p*e+l*6+q*e+37*6+1*e+4g*6+3*e+g*6+c*e+2k*6+1*e+1t*6+c*e+58*6+r*e+1s*6+h*e+c*6+d*e+4*6+b*e+26*6+8*e+2*6+b*e+2*6+x*e+8*6+2*e+q*6+4*e+t*6+5*e+6*6+9*e|2+3g*6|1+1*6+2m*e|1+1*e+4v*6+15*e+1*6|2+do*6+2d*e+d*6+1*e|1+1*e+1*6+4x*e+1*6+1*e|2+4g*6+23*e|1+1*6|3+iq*9|1+1*6|3+ea*6+ad*e+39*6|2+o6*6+5l*6*d+q*6+2d*9|1+1*6|3+4k*6*j+32*6|2+2*f|3+23*0*c+2*a*c+1p*a|1+1*0*c+2*a*c+1t*a|1+1*0*c+2*a*c+1y*a|1+1*0*c+2*a*c+1w*a|1+1*0*c+2*a*c+20*a|1+1*0*c+2*a*c+21*a|1+1*0*c+2*a*c+1s*a|1+1*0*c+2*a*c+1u*a|1+1*0*c+2*a*c+1w*a|1+1*0*c+2*a*c+1u*0|1+1*0*c+2*a*c+1y*a|1+1*0*c+2*a*c+1y*a|1+1*0*c+2*a*c+1y*a|1+1*0*c+2*a*c+v*f|1+1*f*1+v*f+1*a|1+1*0+2*a+1*a*c+1m*a|1+1*0*c+2*a*c+1t*a|1+1*0*c+2*a*c+1y*a|1+1*0*c+2*a*c+1y*f|1+1*f+1g*0+1*f|1+h*f+1s*0+1*f|1+5*f+z*0+1*f|1+y*f+11*0+1*f|7+bt|1+1+17*0|1+1|1+1+t*6+6+4s*0+1+1*0+1+1*0+b3*9+m*0+1+3w*6+b+11*6+1+3c*6+9+9*6+5|2+8y+3p*0+1+1*0+m+15*0+1o+2*6+d+1v*6+b+w*6+2g+2*6+h+1*6+8*9+3+16*6+a+b*6+x|2+88+m*6+h+35*6+4+l*6+4+2*6+l+3*6+5+1h*6+2|2+95+w*6+1+8*6+1+8*6+1+6s*6+2|1+95*6|2+72|1+1*0+2*1+1x*0|1+1*0+2*1+1y*0|1+1*0+2*1+s*0|1+1*0+2*1+1o*0|1+1*0+2*1+1x*0|1+1*0+2*1+1a|1+1*0+2*1+1v*0|1+1*0+2*1+1z*0|1+1*0+2*1+1z*0|1+1*0+2*1+21*0|1+1*0+2*1+1x*0|1+1*0+2*1+1t*0|1+1*0*1+2*1+1d*0|1+1*0+2*1+10*0|1+1*0+2*1+l|1+1*0+7+16*0+1|2+2*0+2+n*0|1+1*0+2+1j*7|1+1*0+2|1+1f*7|5+6h*7+1r*0|1+1*7|2+46*0|1+1*6+cs*a|1+1*6|1+1|1+1"}}},"pad:observatory.guide.introduction:revs:5601":{"changeset":"Z:bi9>7|y=41i=dk*e+7$veloped","meta":{"author":"a.UNWRO0eoIgQHRlJ9","timestamp":1520194753834}},"pad:observatory.guide.introduction:revs:5602":{"changeset":"Z:big>7|y=41i=dr*e+7$

galaxy. It is neither revolutionary [@marx:1848:cmanifesto] nor is it a global scale vulnerability [@meltdown:2018:spectre17], but no matter where you happen to be, there is the spectre of a software running somewhere in the background. Look! There it is, looking right back at you. Be it your phone screen or a passing satellite, software's observation and entanglement in the everyday appears complete. But is it so total? Let's look more closely. \n\n We find ourselves in a universe built on a 1990s revival of a 1960s dream: software as a service [@haigh:2001:soft60]. In this online universe, the use of software has increasingly been knitted into the production of software, even while the rhetoric, rights, and procedures around software continue to suggest that use and production constitute separate realms. This knitting together and its corresponding disavowal radically alters the operative role of software in society. The shifts ripple across galaxies, through social structures, working conditions, and personal relations, resulting in a profusion of apparatuses that aspire to be seamless while optimizing and monetizing individual and collective flows of information in line with the interests of a handful of actors. The diffusion of software services affects individuals and communities in the form of intensified identity shaping and self-management, and affects the public, as institutions and common use infrastructures increasingly rely on \"solutions\" provided by private companies for their management. As online services increasingly centralize data flows in the clouds, they blur the last traces of the thin line separating bio- from necro-politics.[@hu:2015:prehistory]\n\nGiven how software spins its web around us, our first reflex to attempt to take a distance, only to realize that it is a gooey net in which we are already entangled. Caught upside down and dangling we ask: How can we interact, respond to, and think with software? What approaches can we use to recognize the agency of different actors, their ways of working, and their politics? What methods of observation are conducive to critical inquiry and affirmative discord? How can we resurface software, to find sites where its infrastructures are reconfiguring the everyday? How can we take stock of the ways software is always at work, especially where it is designed to disappear into the background?\n\nBowled over by these questions, by constant pop-ups and push notifications, a fantasy takes shape. \nTaking a sledge hammer to our devices, throwing them in the river, retreating off grid and out of sight, and living software free lives. But it is a fantasy that won't hold still. \nA fantasy that is maybe available to the tech-biilionaires, the poorest of our planet and to those having an unexpected tantrum we fear is not going to do it.\nWe are in search of a better fantasy. One that lets us poke and push back. \n\n\nTogether, we picked up the word \"observation\", turning it over and around. We brought it right up to our noses and held it outstretched to get a better look, holding all of the histories of people looking at others and objects in mind, holding terminals (%CARLINSAYS: is this the right word?) and keyboards in hand. Observation, and the enabling of it through intensive data-centric feedback mechanisms, is part of the cybernetic spells that underpin present day software production. In this present moment, we sync our breath to the rhythm of our software and propose holistic observation as one way to enter an engagement with software's implications. Will you join us?\n\n(%CARLINSAYS: This guide is one answer to these questions, and it tickles.)\nThe Techno-Galactic Software Survival Guide (%CARLINSAYS: use agreed title) is an obsessive fantasy of optimization turned on its head, and stuck to the ceiling of a self-reflecting elevator. It is the ultimate book of dos and don'ts, of forgotten histories and un-inevitable futures, of mindful agile actions and improvisational service architectures, of any and all things that you can and cannot imagine needing in a techno-galaxy.  \n\nThis guide offers a set of practical and fantastical tools for the tactical (mis)use of software, empowering/enabling users to resist embedded paradigms and assumptions. It is a collection of methods for approaching software, experiencing its myths and realities, its risks and benefits. Drawing on theories of software and computation developed in academia and elsewhere, (%CARLINSAYS: BUMP, maybe introduce the event and us here so that it is clear who the \"we\" is here... At TGSO we developed the state of art methods for you.) we grounded our methods in hands-on exercises and experiments that you now can try at home. This Guide to Techno-Galactic Software Observation (%CARLINSAYS: use agreed title) offers methods developed in and inspired by the context of software production, hacker culture, software studies, computer science research, Free Software communities, privacy activism, and artistic practice. It invites you to experiment with ways to stay with the trouble of software. We are techno-galactic as we meet the contemporary paradigms of computation that proudly announce their capability for \"scaling up to the universe.\" We stand here as modest witnesses to the scales of software communities and related political economies that involve and require observation. Reading is not enough, software is not just a text, observation is one potential beginning, engagement is tickling. \n\nCan you call up that feeling of the approach of a touch that cannot be born with a straight face? Come join us at the edge of the universe, on the metro platform, at your kitchen table, as we mark and measure critical distances from and entanglements with the seemingly endless software systems that surround us.\n\n\nThe techno-galactic software survival guide (%CARLINSAYS: use agreed title) was collectively produced as an outcome of the Techno-Galactic Software Observatory. \n[This feels like it could be in a different font size or in brackets or is the start of the next page/spread?]\n\n\nkostas axelos, planetary interlude, maybe some bits fit with the intro?:\n\n%  We open ourselves to abysses and we are swallowed up in sys-\n%  tems and totalizations - for these are fragments and segments of\n%  \"totality\" which establish themselves as total and/or partial totali-\n%  tarisms - without foreseeing what might be the home, the house, the\n%  habitat of living, thinking man, an unfinished, unfinishable being in a\n%  history which is equally so, neither a shell stuck fast to a rock, nor a\n%  simple nomad or vagabond. Mortals wish for the familiar and for\n%  adventure, the known and the unknown, undecided as to who decides\n%  and to what he decides, chosen rather than choosing. Since they are\n%  unable to be their own master, they allow themselves to be fixed,\n%  tossed about, carried away, scattered and put to flight, incapable of\n%  choosing - if choice there be - between success in and in relation to\n%  the world, and the World. All this does not constitute an error; wan-\n%  dering (errance) commands it. \n Galactic irony is watching us. \n%  Dream of a shadow and dispenser of light, conquistador and\n%  deserter of the World, pawn and pioneer, man sets out to conquer\n%  the stars and he ploughs the sea. The assault he launches against the\n%  astral earth and against the celestial stars is not without disaster.\n Whether he delves into analysis and disintegration -- since he needs\n analyses, concrete and tangible solutions and experimentations -- or\n whether he plunges into syntheses -- since the abstracting power and\n the ungraspable attract him equally --, as precisely and as far as he\n may cast his nets, what his nets catch and what passes through them\n communicate. Never quite awake and never quite beclouded, will we\n learn to live and to see beings and things simultaneously from close\n up and far away, large and small, in their and in our wandering\n (errance), in the great World which is at the same time small, where\n there are no victors - would there be vanquished?\n\n## The Techno-Galactic Software Observatory\n\nIn the summer of 2017, thirty or so people gathered in Brussels to explore practices of proximate critique with and of software in the context of a worksession entitled \"Techno-Galactic Software Observatory\".[^]{Worksessions are intensive transdisciplinary moments, organised twice a year by Constant. They aim to provide conditions for participants with different experiences and capabilities to temporarily link their practice and to  develop ideas, prototypes and  research projects together. For the worksessions, primarily Free, Libre and Open Source software is used and material that is available under Open Content Licenses.} The worksession called for software-curious people of all kinds to ask questions about software. The intuition behind such a call was that developing different types of engagement requires a heterogeneous group of participants with different levels of expertise,  skill and background. During three sessions that were two days each, participants collectively inspected the space-time of computation and probed the universe of hardware-software separations through excursions, exercises and conversations. They tried out various perspectives and methods to look at the larger picture of software as a concept, as a practice, and as a set of techniques.\n\nThe first two days of The Techno-Galactic Software Observatory included visits to the Musée de l'Informatique Pionnière en Belgique [^]{http://www.nam-ip.be} in Namur and the Computermuseum KULeuven[^]{http://etwie.be/database/actor/computermuseum-ku-leuven}. Surrounded by these collections of historical ’numerical artefacts’, we started considering software in a long-term context (% CARLINSAYS: Do we mean a long historical context or longue duree or something else?). The museum visits provided an occasion to reflect on the conditions of software's appearance (% CARLINSAYS: appearances?) and to take on current-day questions from a genealogical perspective. What is software? How did it appear as a concept, in what industrial and governmental circumstances? What happens to the material conditions of its production (minerals, factory labor, hardware) when it evaporates into a cloud?\n\nThe second two days were spent focusing on the space-time dimension of IT development. The way computer programs and operating systems are manufactured has changed tremendously over the last seventy years, as has its production times and places. From military labs to the mega-corporation cubicles to the open-space freelancer utopia, what ruptures and continuities can be traced in the production, deployment, maintenance and destruction of software? From time-sharing to user-space partitions and containerization, what separations were and are at work? Where and when is software made today?\n\nThe last two days at the Techno-Galactic Software Observatory were dedicated to observation and its consequences. The development of software encompasses a series of practices whose evocative names are increasingly familiar: feedback, report, probe, audit, inspect, scan, diagnose, explore, test. What are the systems of knowledge and power within which these activities take place, and what other types of observation are possible? As a practical set for our investigations, we set up a walk-in clinic on the 25th floor of the World Trade Center, where users and developers could arrive with software-questions of all kinds.\n\n## The Walk-in Clinic (% CARLINSAYS: I think this title should go below the description of the walk-in clinic as the last two days of the observatory worksession and should come instead right above the invitation to the clinic so I have moved it there)\n\n> Do you suffer from the disappearance of your software into the cloud,\n> feel oppressed by unequal user privilege, or experience the torment of\n> software-ransom of any sort?\n> Bring your devices and interfaces to the World Trade Center!\n> With the help of a clear and in-depth session, at the Techno-Galactic\n> Walk-In Clinic we guarantee immediate results.\n> The  Walk-In Clinic provides free hands-on observations to software\n> curious  people of all kinds.

It also seems important to make sure that the two page list of services poster for the clinic is printed on pages that are facing each other.

happen.)\n\n\n","attribs":"*0+n+1*7+3*0|2+2*7+2+2*6+1+8*6+1+6*6+1+8*6+1+8*6+1+a*6+3*7+1*6+5o|2+2+1q*0|1+1+1s*0|1+1+1p*0|1+1+18*6|1+1|1+q*b|1+1*6+1r*0+1*e+b*6+1f*0+1*e+n*6+7*e+1*6+1g*e+1*6+3q*e+a*6+z*e+m*6+1s*e|2+2*6+2p*e+l*6+q*e+37*6+1*e+f*6+g*e+41*6+3*e+g*6+c*e+2k*6+1*e+1t*6+c*e+58*6+r*e+1s*6+h*e+c*6+d*e+4*6+b*e+26*6+8*e+2*6+b*e+2*6+x*e+8*6+2*e+q*6+4*e+t*6+5*e+6*6+9*e+q*6+l*e|2+2*e+1p*6+2*e+2t*6+15*e+1*6|2+do*6+2d*e+d*6+1*e|1+1*e+1*6+4x*e+1*6+1*e|2+4g*6+23*e|1+1*6|3+iq*9|1+1*6|3+ea*6+ad*e+4e*6|2+o6*6+5l*6*d+q*6+2d*9|1+1*6|3+4k*6*j+32*6|2+2*f|3+23*0*c+2*a*c+1p*a|1+1*0*c+2*a*c+1t*a|1+1*0*c+2*a*c+1y*a|1+1*0*c+2*a*c+1w*a|1+1*0*c+2*a*c+20*a|1+1*0*c+2*a*c+21*a|1+1*0*c+2*a*c+1s*a|1+1*0*c+2*a*c+1u*a|1+1*0*c+2*a*c+1w*a|1+1*0*c+2*a*c+1u*0|1+1*0*c+2*a*c+1y*a|1+1*0*c+2*a*c+1y*a|1+1*0*c+2*a*c+1y*a|1+1*0*c+2*a*c+v*f|1+1*f*1+v*f+1*a|1+1*0+2*a+1*a*c+1m*a|1+1*0*c+2*a*c+1t*a|1+1*0*c+2*a*c+1y*a|1+1*0*c+2*a*c+1y*f|1+1*f+1g*0+1*f|1+h*f+1s*0+1*f|1+5*f+z*0+1*f|1+y*f+11*0+1*f|7+bt|1+1+17*0|1+1|1+1+t*6+6+4s*0+1+1*0+1+1*0+b3*9+m*0+1+3w*6+b+11*6+1+3c*6+9+9*6+5|2+8y+3p*0+1+1*0+m+15*0+1o+2*6+d+1v*6+b+w*6+2g+2*6+h+1*6+8*9+3+16*6+a+b*6+x|2+88+m*6+h+35*6+4+l*6+4+2*6+l+3*6+5+1h*6+2|2+95+w*6+1+8*6+1+8*6+1+6s*6+2|1+95*6|2+72|1+1*0+2*1+1x*0|1+1*0+2*1+1y*0|1+1*0+2*1+s*0|1+1*0+2*1+1o*0|1+1*0+2*1+1x*0|1+1*0+2*1+1a|1+1*0+2*1+1v*0|1+1*0+2*1+1z*0|1+1*0+2*1+1z*0|1+1*0+2*1+21*0|1+1*0+2*1+1x*0|1+1*0+2*1+1t*0|1+1*0*1+2*1+1d*0|1+1*0+2*1+10*0|1+1*0+2*1+l|1+1*0+7+16*0+1|2+2*0+2+n*0|1+1*0+2+1j*7|1+1*0+2|1+1f*7|5+6h*7+1r*0|1+1*7|2+46*0|1+1*6+cs*a|1+1*6|1+1|1+1"}}},"pad:observatory.guide.introduction:revs:5701":{"changeset":"Z:b3s>1|e=1r5=1p*6+1$m","meta":{"author":"a.EXnmpSWanmHBGv1u","timestamp":1520212589849}},"pad:observatory.guide.introduction:revs:5702":{"changeset":"Z:b3t>2|e=1r5=1q*6+2$ay","meta":{"author":"a.EXnmpSWanmHBGv1u","timestamp":1520212590343}},"pad:observatory.guide.introduction:revs:5703":{"changeset":"Z:b3v>4|e=1r5=1s*6+4$

TOCITEM: Introduction T:4\n\n# A Guide to Techno-Galactic Software Observation (% CARLINSAYS: is our title \"A Guide to Techno-Galactic Software Observation\" or \"The Techno-Galactic Guide to Software Observation\" or \"The Techno-Galactic Software Survival Guide\" or some other iteration?)\n\n> I am less interested in the critical practice of reflection,\n> of showing once-again that the emperor has no clothes, than in\n> finding a way to diffract critical inquiry in order to make\n> difference patterns in a more worldly way.\n> [@haraway:1996:witness]\n\nA spectre is haunting the galaxy. It is neither revolutionary [@marx:1848:cmanifesto] nor is it a global scale vulnerability [@meltdown:2018:spectre17], but no matter where you happen to be, there is the spectre of a software running somewhere in the background. Look! There it is, looking right back at you. Be it your phone screen or a passing satellite, software's observation and entanglement in the everyday appears complete. But is it so total? Let's look more closely. \n\n We find ourselves in a universe built on a 1990s revival of a 1960s dream: software as a service [@haigh:2001:soft60]. In this online universe, the use of software has increasingly been knitted into the production of software, even while the rhetoric, rights, and procedures around software continue to suggest that use and production constitute separate realms. This knitting together and its corresponding disavowal radically alters the operative role of software in society. The shifts ripple across galaxies, through social structures, working conditions, and personal relations, resulting in a profusion of apparatuses that aspire to be seamless while optimizing and monetizing individual and collective flows of information in line with the interests of a handful of actors. The diffusion of software services affects individuals and communities in the form of intensified identity shaping and self-management, and affects the public, as institutions and common use infrastructures increasingly rely on \"solutions\" provided by private companies for their management. As online services increasingly centralize data flows in the clouds, they blur the last traces of the thin line separating bio- from necro-politics.[@hu:2015:prehistory]\n\nGiven how software spins its web around us, we reflexively try to take some distance only to realize that we are already entangled in its gooey net . Caught upside down and dangling we ask: How can we interact, respond to, and think with software? What approaches can we use to recognize the agency of different actors, their ways of working, and their politics? What methods of observation are conducive to critical inquiry and affirmative discord? How can we resurface software, to find sites where its infrastructures are reconfiguring the everyday? How can we take stock of the ways software is always at work, especially where it is designed to disappear into the background?\n\nBowled over by these questions, by constant pop-ups and push notifications, a fantasy takes shape. \nTaking a sledge hammer to our devices, throwing them in the river, retreating off grid and out of sight, and living software free lives. But it is a fantasy that won't hold still. \nA fantasy that is maybe available to the tech-biilionaires, the poorest of our planet and to those having an unexpected tantrum we fear is not going to do it.\nWe are in search of a better fantasy. One that lets us poke and push back. \n\n\nTogether, we picked up the word \"observation\", turning it over and around. We brought it right up to our noses and held it outstretched to get a better look, holding all of the histories of people looking at others and objects in mind, holding terminals (%CARLINSAYS: is this the right word?) and keyboards in hand. Observation, and the enabling of it through intensive data-centric feedback mechanisms, is part of the cybernetic spells that underpin present day software production. In this present moment, we sync our breath to the rhythm of our software and propose holistic observation as one way to enter an engagement with software's implications. Will you join us?\n\n(%CARLINSAYS: This guide is one answer to these questions, and it tickles.)\nThe Techno-Galactic Software Survival Guide (%CARLINSAYS: use agreed title) is an obsessive fantasy of optimization turned on its head, and stuck to the ceiling of a self-reflecting elevator. It is the ultimate book of dos and don'ts, of forgotten histories and un-inevitable futures, of mindful agile actions and improvisational service architectures, of any and all things that you can and cannot imagine needing in a techno-galaxy.  \n\nThis guide offers a set of practical and fantastical tools for the tactical (mis)use of software, empowering/enabling users to resist embedded paradigms and assumptions. It is a collection of methods for approaching software, experiencing its myths and realities, its risks and benefits. Drawing on theories of software and computation developed in academia and elsewhere, (%CARLINSAYS: BUMP, maybe introduce the event and us here so that it is clear who the \"we\" is here... At TGSO we developed the state of art methods for you.) we grounded our methods in hands-on exercises and experiments that you now can try at home. This Guide to Techno-Galactic Software Observation (%CARLINSAYS: use agreed title) offers methods developed in and inspired by the context of software production, hacker culture, software studies, computer science research, Free Software communities, privacy activism, and artistic practice. It invites you to experiment with ways to stay with the trouble of software. We are techno-galactic as we meet the contemporary paradigms of computation that proudly announce their capability for \"scaling up to the universe.\" We stand here as modest witnesses to the scales of software communities and related political economies that involve and require observation. Reading is not enough, software is not just a text, observation is one potential beginning, engagement is tickling. \n\nCan you call up that feeling of the approach of a touch that cannot be born with a straight face? Come join us at the edge of the universe, on the metro platform, at your kitchen table, as we mark and measure critical distances from and entanglements with the seemingly endless software systems that surround us.\n\n\nThe techno-galactic software survival guide (%CARLINSAYS: use agreed title) was collectively produced as an outcome of the Techno-Galactic Software Observatory. \n[This feels like it could be in a different font size or in brackets or is the start of the next page/spread?]\n\n\nkostas axelos, planetary interlude, maybe some bits fit with the intro?:\n\n%  We open ourselves to abysses and we are swallowed up in sys-\n%  tems and totalizations - for these are fragments and segments of\n%  \"totality\" which establish themselves as total and/or partial totali-\n%  tarisms - without foreseeing what might be the home, the house, the\n%  habitat of living, thinking man, an unfinished, unfinishable being in a\n%  history which is equally so, neither a shell stuck fast to a rock, nor a\n%  simple nomad or vagabond. Mortals wish for the familiar and for\n%  adventure, the known and the unknown, undecided as to who decides\n%  and to what he decides, chosen rather than choosing. Since they are\n%  unable to be their own master, they allow themselves to be fixed,\n%  tossed about, carried away, scattered and put to flight, incapable of\n%  choosing - if choice there be - between success in and in relation to\n%  the world, and the World. All this does not constitute an error; wan-\n%  dering (errance) commands it. \n Galactic irony is watching us. \n%  Dream of a shadow and dispenser of light, conquistador and\n%  deserter of the World, pawn and pioneer, man sets out to conquer\n%  the stars and he ploughs the sea. The assault he launches against the\n%  astral earth and against the celestial stars is not without disaster.\n Whether he delves into analysis and disintegration -- since he needs\n analyses, concrete and tangible solutions and experimentations -- or\n whether he plunges into syntheses -- since the abstracting power and\n the ungraspable attract him equally --, as precisely and as far as he\n may cast his nets, what his nets catch and what passes through them\n communicate. Never quite awake and never quite beclouded, will we\n learn to live and to see beings and things simultaneously from close\n up and far away, large and small, in their and in our wandering\n (errance), in the great World which is at the same time small, where\n there are no victors - would there be vanquished?\n\n## The Techno-Galactic Software Observatory\n\nIn the summer of 2017, thirty or so people gathered in Brussels to explore practices of proximate critique with and of software in the context of a worksession entitled \"Techno-Galactic Software Observatory\".[^]{Worksessions are intensive transdisciplinary moments, organised twice a year by Constant. They aim to provide conditions for participants with different experiences and capabilities to temporarily link their practice and to  develop ideas, prototypes and  research projects together. For the worksessions, primarily Free, Libre and Open Source software is used and material that is available under Open Content Licenses.} The worksession called for software-curious people of all kinds to ask questions about software. The intuition behind such a call was that developing different types of engagement requires a heterogeneous group of participants with different levels of expertise,  skill and background. During three sessions that were two days each, participants collectively inspected the space-time of computation and probed the universe of hardware-software separations through excursions, exercises and conversations. They tried out various perspectives and methods to look at the larger picture of software as a concept, as a practice, and as a set of techniques.\n\nThe first two days of The Techno-Galactic Software Observatory included visits to the Musée de l'Informatique Pionnière en Belgique [^]{http://www.nam-ip.be} in Namur and the Computermuseum KULeuven[^]{http://etwie.be/database/actor/computermuseum-ku-leuven}. Surrounded by these collections of historical ’numerical artefacts’, we started considering software in a long-term context (% CARLINSAYS: Do we mean a long historical context or longue duree or something else?). The museum visits provided an occasion to reflect on the conditions of software's appearance (% CARLINSAYS: appearances?) and to take on current-day questions from a genealogical perspective. What is software? How did it appear as a concept, in what industrial and governmental circumstances? What happens to the material conditions of its production (minerals, factory labor, hardware) when it evaporates into a cloud?\n\nThe second two days were spent focusing on the space-time dimension of IT development. The way computer programs and operating systems are manufactured has changed tremendously over the last seventy years, as has its production times and places. From military labs to the mega-corporation cubicles to the open-space freelancer utopia, what ruptures and continuities can be traced in the production, deployment, maintenance and destruction of software? From time-sharing to user-space partitions and containerization, what separations were and are at work? Where and when is software made today?\n\nThe last two days at the Techno-Galactic Software Observatory were dedicated to observation and its consequences. The development of software encompasses a series of practices whose evocative names are increasingly familiar: feedback, report, probe, audit, inspect, scan, diagnose, explore, test. What are the systems of knowledge and power within which these activities take place, and what other types of observation are possible? As a practical set for our investigations, we set up a walk-in clinic on the 25th floor of the World Trade Center, where users and developers could arrive with software-questions of all kinds.\n\n## The Walk-in Clinic (% CARLINSAYS: I think this title should go below the description of the walk-in clinic as the last two days of the observatory worksession and should come instead right above the invitation to the clinic so I have moved it there)\n\n> Do you suffer from the disappearance of your software into the cloud,\n> feel oppressed by unequal user privilege, or experience the torment of\n> software-ransom of any sort?\n> Bring your devices and interfaces to the World Trade Center!\n> With the help of a clear and in-depth session, at the Techno-Galactic\n> Walk-In Clinic we guarantee immediate results.\n> The  Walk-In Clinic provides free hands-on observations to software\n> curious  people of all kinds. A wide range of professional and amateur \n> practitioners will provide you with Software-as-a-Critique-as-a-Service\n> on the spot. Available services range from immediate interface critique, \n> collaborative code inspection, data dowsing, various forms of network\n> analyses, unusability testing, identification of unknown viruses,\n> risk assessment, opening of black-boxes and more.\n> Free software observations provided.\n> Last intake at 16:45.\n> [^]{Invitation to the Walk-In Clinic, June 2017}\n\n% On the following pages:\n% Software as a Critique as a Service (SaaCaaS) Directory\n% and intake forms for Software Curious People (SCP)\n\n% PDF: http://observatory.constantvzw.org/documents/scprecord_FINAL.pdf 1x1 REF:scprecord\n% INFO: Intake Forms for Software Curious People (SCP)\n\n% PDF: http://observatory.constantvzw.org/documents/masterlist_twosides_NEU.pdf 2 1x1\n% INFO: Software as a Critique as a Service (SaaCaaS) Directory\n% PDF: http://observatory.constantvzw.org/documents/masterlist_twosides_NEU.pdf 1 1x1\n% INFO: Software as a Critique as a Service (SaaCaaS) Directory\n\n(% CARLINSAYS: I would suggest switching the order of these pages so the intake form is first and the list of services poster is second. It also seems important to make sure that the two page list of services poster for the clinic is printed on pages that are facing each other. If they are already set to do that then maybe nix my suggestion of moving the intake form up, but if they are not then that would be one way to shift the pages to make that happen.)\n\n\n","attribs":"*0+n+1*7+3*0|2+2*7+2+2*6+1+8*6+1+6*6+1+8*6+1+8*6+1+a*6+3*7+1*6+5o|2+2+1q*0|1+1+1s*0|1+1+1p*0|1+1+18*6|1+1|1+q*b|1+1*6+1r*0+1*e+b*6+1f*0+1*e+n*6+7*e+1*6+1g*e+1*6+3q*e+a*6+z*e+m*6+1s*e|2+2*6+2p*e+l*6+q*e+37*6+1*e+f*6+g*e+41*6+3*e+g*6+c*e+2k*6+1*e+1t*6+c*e+58*6+r*e+1s*6+h*e+c*6+d*e+4*6+b*e+26*6+8*e+2*6+b*e+2*6+x*e+8*6+2*e+q*6+4*e+t*6+5*e+6*6+9*e+q*6+l*e|2+2*e+18*6+w*e+9*6+8*e+d*6+v*e+b*6+15*e+1*6|2+do*6+2d*e+d*6+1*e|1+1*e+1*6+4x*e+1*6+1*e|2+4g*6+23*e|1+1*6|3+iq*9|1+1*6|3+ea*6+ad*e+4e*6|2+o6*6+5l*6*d+q*6+2d*9|1+1*6|3+4k*6*j+32*6|2+2*f|3+23*0*c+2*a*c+1p*a|1+1*0*c+2*a*c+1t*a|1+1*0*c+2*a*c+1y*a|1+1*0*c+2*a*c+1w*a|1+1*0*c+2*a*c+20*a|1+1*0*c+2*a*c+21*a|1+1*0*c+2*a*c+1s*a|1+1*0*c+2*a*c+1u*a|1+1*0*c+2*a*c+1w*a|1+1*0*c+2*a*c+1u*0|1+1*0*c+2*a*c+1y*a|1+1*0*c+2*a*c+1y*a|1+1*0*c+2*a*c+1y*a|1+1*0*c+2*a*c+v*f|1+1*f*1+v*f+1*a|1+1*0+2*a+1*a*c+1m*a|1+1*0*c+2*a*c+1t*a|1+1*0*c+2*a*c+1y*a|1+1*0*c+2*a*c+1y*f|1+1*f+1g*0+1*f|1+h*f+1s*0+1*f|1+5*f+z*0+1*f|1+y*f+11*0+1*f|7+bt|1+1+17*0|1+1|1+1+t*6+6+4s*0+1+1*0+1+1*0+b3*9+m*0+1+3w*6+b+11*6+1+3c*6+9+9*6+5|2+8y+3p*0+1+1*0+m+15*0+1o+2*6+d+1v*6+b+w*6+2g+2*6+h+1*6+8*9+3+16*6+a+b*6+x|2+88+m*6+h+35*6+4+l*6+4+2*6+l+3*6+5+1h*6+2|2+95+w*6+1+8*6+1+8*6+1+6s*6+2|1+95*6|2+72|1+1*0+2*1+1x*0|1+1*0+2*1+1y*0|1+1*0+2*1+s*0|1+1*0+2*1+1o*0|1+1*0+2*1+1x*0|1+1*0+2*1+1a|1+1*0+2*1+1v*0|1+1*0+2*1+1z*0|1+1*0+2*1+1z*0|1+1*0+2*1+21*0|1+1*0+2*1+1x*0|1+1*0+2*1+1t*0|1+1*0*1+2*1+1d*0|1+1*0+2*1+10*0|1+1*0+2*1+l|1+1*0+7+16*0+1|2+2*0+2+n*0|1+1*0+2+1j*7|1+1*0+2|1+1f*7|5+6h*7+1r*0|1+1*7|2+46*0|1+1*6+cs*a|1+1*6|1+1|1+1"}}},"pad:observatory.guide.introduction:revs:5801":{"changeset":"Z:b3c<1|e=1r5=43-1$","meta":{"author":"a.EXnmpSWanmHBGv1u","timestamp":1520212787273}},"pad:observatory.guide.introduction:revs:5802":{"changeset":"Z:b3b<6|e=1r5=35-7*6+1$h","meta":{"author":"a.EXnmpSWanmHBGv1u","timestamp":1520212790612}},"pad:observatory.guide.introduction:revs:5803":{"changeset":"Z:b35>3|e=1r5=36*6+3$elp","meta":{"author":"a.EXnmpSWanmHBGv1u","timestamp":1520212791103}},"pad:observatory.guide.introduction:revs:5804":{"changeset":"Z:b38<1|e=1r5=38-1$","meta":{"author":"a.EXnmpSWanmHBGv1u","timestamp":1520212792312}},"pad:observatory.guide.introduction:revs:5805":{"changeset":"Z:b37>1|e=1r5=38*6+1$p","meta":{"author":"a.EXnmpSWanmHBGv1u","timestamp":1520212793385}},"pad:observatory.guide.introduction:revs:5806":{"changeset":"Z:b38<1|e=1r5=38-1$","meta":{"author":"a.EXnmpSWanmHBGv1u","timestamp":1520212793885}},"pad:observatory.guide.introduction:revs:5807":{"changeset":"Z:b37<3|e=1r5=35-3$","meta":{"author":"a.EXnmpSWanmHBGv1u","timestamp":1520212794386}},"pad:observatory.guide.introduction:revs:5808":{"changeset":"Z:b34>4|e=1r5=35*6+4$alre","meta":{"author":"a.EXnmpSWanmHBGv1u","timestamp":1520212794902}},"pad:observatory.guide.introduction:revs:5809":{"changeset":"Z:b38>3|e=1r5=39*6+3$ady","meta":{"author":"a.EXnmpSWanmHBGv1u","timestamp":1520212795409}},"pad:observatory.guide.introduction:revs:581":{"changeset":"Z:7g1<9|1u=76v=1q-9$","meta":{"author":"a.PRabeGfk5jCXUq8V","timestamp":1516284419135}},"pad:observatory.guide.introduction:revs:5810":{"changeset":"Z:b3b<1|e=1r5=3e-1$","meta":{"author":"a.EXnmpSWanmHBGv1u","timestamp":1520212806853}},"pad:observatory.guide.introduction:revs:5811":{"changeset":"Z:b3a<1|e=1r5=3d-1$","meta":{"author":"a.EXnmpSWanmHBGv1u","timestamp":1520212807343}},"pad:observatory.guide.introduction:revs:5812":{"changeset":"Z:b39<5|e=1r5=35-7*6+2$to","meta":{"author":"a.EXnmpSWanmHBGv1u","timestamp":1520212815053}},"pad:observatory.guide.introduction:revs:5813":{"changeset":"Z:b34>5|e=1r5=37*6+5$o

TOCITEM: Introduction T:4\n\n# A Guide to Techno-Galactic Software Observation (% CARLINSAYS: is our title \"A Guide to Techno-Galactic Software Observation\" or \"The Techno-Galactic Guide to Software Observation\" or \"The Techno-Galactic Software Survival Guide\" or some other iteration?)\n\n> I am less interested in the critical practice of reflection,\n> of showing once-again that the emperor has no clothes, than in\n> finding a way to diffract critical inquiry in order to make\n> difference patterns in a more worldly way.\n> [@haraway:1996:witness]\n\nA spectre is haunting the galaxy. It is neither revolutionary [@marx:1848:cmanifesto] nor is it a global scale vulnerability [@meltdown:2018:spectre17], but no matter where you happen to be, there is the spectre of a software running somewhere in the background. Look! There it is, looking right back at you. Be it your phone screen or a passing satellite, software's observation and entanglement in the everyday appears complete. But is it so total? Let's look more closely. \n\n We find ourselves in a universe built on a 1990s revival of a 1960s dream: software as a service [@haigh:2001:soft60]. In this online universe, the use of software has increasingly been knitted into the production of software, even while the rhetoric, rights, and procedures around software continue to suggest that use and production constitute separate realms. This knitting together and its corresponding disavowal radically alters the operative role of software in society. The shifts ripple across galaxies, through social structures, working conditions, and personal relations, resulting in a profusion of apparatuses that aspire to be seamless while optimizing and monetizing individual and collective flows of information in line with the interests of a handful of actors. The diffusion of software services affects individuals and communities in the form of intensified identity shaping and self-management, and affects the public, as institutions and common use infrastructures increasingly rely on \"solutions\" provided by private companies for their management. As online services increasingly centralize data flows in the clouds, they blur the last traces of the thin line separating bio- from necro-politics.[@hu:2015:prehistory]\n\nAs software spins its web around us, we reflexively try to take some distance only to realize that we are too well tangled in its gooey net. Caught upside down and dangling we ask: How can we interact, respond to, and think with software? What approaches can we use to recognize the agency of different actors, their ways of working, and their politics? What methods of observation are conducive to critical inquiry and affirmative discord? How can we resurface software, to find sites where its infrastructures are reconfiguring the everyday? How can we take stock of the ways software is always at work, especially where it is designed to disappear into the background?\n\nBowled over by these questions, by constant pop-ups and push notifications, a fantasy takes shape of smashing our devices with a sledge hammer, throwing them in the river, retreating off grid and out of sight, and living software free lives. But this fantasy that cannot hold because it cannot hold us. Perhaps it is available to the tech-biilionaires, but for the poorest of our planet and for those having an unexpected tantrum we fear is not going to do it.\nWe are in search of a better fantasy. One that lets us poke and push back. \n\n\nTogether, we picked up the word \"observation\", turning it over and around. We brought it right up to our noses and held it outstretched to get a better look, holding all of the histories of people looking at others and objects in mind, holding terminals (%CARLINSAYS: is this the right word?) and keyboards in hand. Observation, and the enabling of it through intensive data-centric feedback mechanisms, is part of the cybernetic spells that underpin present day software production. In this present moment, we sync our breath to the rhythm of our software and propose holistic observation as one way to enter an engagement with software's implications. Will you join us?\n\n(%CARLINSAYS: This guide is one answer to these questions, and it tickles.)\nThe Techno-Galactic Software Survival Guide (%CARLINSAYS: use agreed title) is an obsessive fantasy of optimization turned on its head, and stuck to the ceiling of a self-reflecting elevator. It is the ultimate book of dos and don'ts, of forgotten histories and un-inevitable futures, of mindful agile actions and improvisational service architectures, of any and all things that you can and cannot imagine needing in a techno-galaxy.  \n\nThis guide offers a set of practical and fantastical tools for the tactical (mis)use of software, empowering/enabling users to resist embedded paradigms and assumptions. It is a collection of methods for approaching software, experiencing its myths and realities, its risks and benefits. Drawing on theories of software and computation developed in academia and elsewhere, (%CARLINSAYS: BUMP, maybe introduce the event and us here so that it is clear who the \"we\" is here... At TGSO we developed the state of art methods for you.) we grounded our methods in hands-on exercises and experiments that you now can try at home. This Guide to Techno-Galactic Software Observation (%CARLINSAYS: use agreed title) offers methods developed in and inspired by the context of software production, hacker culture, software studies, computer science research, Free Software communities, privacy activism, and artistic practice. It invites you to experiment with ways to stay with the trouble of software. We are techno-galactic as we meet the contemporary paradigms of computation that proudly announce their capability for \"scaling up to the universe.\" We stand here as modest witnesses to the scales of software communities and related political economies that involve and require observation. Reading is not enough, software is not just a text, observation is one potential beginning, engagement is tickling. \n\nCan you call up that feeling of the approach of a touch that cannot be born with a straight face? Come join us at the edge of the universe, on the metro platform, at your kitchen table, as we mark and measure critical distances from and entanglements with the seemingly endless software systems that surround us.\n\n\nThe techno-galactic software survival guide (%CARLINSAYS: use agreed title) was collectively produced as an outcome of the Techno-Galactic Software Observatory. \n[This feels like it could be in a different font size or in brackets or is the start of the next page/spread?]\n\n\nkostas axelos, planetary interlude, maybe some bits fit with the intro?:\n\n%  We open ourselves to abysses and we are swallowed up in sys-\n%  tems and totalizations - for these are fragments and segments of\n%  \"totality\" which establish themselves as total and/or partial totali-\n%  tarisms - without foreseeing what might be the home, the house, the\n%  habitat of living, thinking man, an unfinished, unfinishable being in a\n%  history which is equally so, neither a shell stuck fast to a rock, nor a\n%  simple nomad or vagabond. Mortals wish for the familiar and for\n%  adventure, the known and the unknown, undecided as to who decides\n%  and to what he decides, chosen rather than choosing. Since they are\n%  unable to be their own master, they allow themselves to be fixed,\n%  tossed about, carried away, scattered and put to flight, incapable of\n%  choosing - if choice there be - between success in and in relation to\n%  the world, and the World. All this does not constitute an error; wan-\n%  dering (errance) commands it. \n Galactic irony is watching us. \n%  Dream of a shadow and dispenser of light, conquistador and\n%  deserter of the World, pawn and pioneer, man sets out to conquer\n%  the stars and he ploughs the sea. The assault he launches against the\n%  astral earth and against the celestial stars is not without disaster.\n Whether he delves into analysis and disintegration -- since he needs\n analyses, concrete and tangible solutions and experimentations -- or\n whether he plunges into syntheses -- since the abstracting power and\n the ungraspable attract him equally --, as precisely and as far as he\n may cast his nets, what his nets catch and what passes through them\n communicate. Never quite awake and never quite beclouded, will we\n learn to live and to see beings and things simultaneously from close\n up and far away, large and small, in their and in our wandering\n (errance), in the great World which is at the same time small, where\n there are no victors - would there be vanquished?\n\n## The Techno-Galactic Software Observatory\n\nIn the summer of 2017, thirty or so people gathered in Brussels to explore practices of proximate critique with and of software in the context of a worksession entitled \"Techno-Galactic Software Observatory\".[^]{Worksessions are intensive transdisciplinary moments, organised twice a year by Constant. They aim to provide conditions for participants with different experiences and capabilities to temporarily link their practice and to  develop ideas, prototypes and  research projects together. For the worksessions, primarily Free, Libre and Open Source software is used and material that is available under Open Content Licenses.} The worksession called for software-curious people of all kinds to ask questions about software. The intuition behind such a call was that developing different types of engagement requires a heterogeneous group of participants with different levels of expertise,  skill and background. During three sessions that were two days each, participants collectively inspected the space-time of computation and probed the universe of hardware-software separations through excursions, exercises and conversations. They tried out various perspectives and methods to look at the larger picture of software as a concept, as a practice, and as a set of techniques.\n\nThe first two days of The Techno-Galactic Software Observatory included visits to the Musée de l'Informatique Pionnière en Belgique [^]{http://www.nam-ip.be} in Namur and the Computermuseum KULeuven[^]{http://etwie.be/database/actor/computermuseum-ku-leuven}. Surrounded by these collections of historical ’numerical artefacts’, we started considering software in a long-term context (% CARLINSAYS: Do we mean a long historical context or longue duree or something else?). The museum visits provided an occasion to reflect on the conditions of software's appearance (% CARLINSAYS: appearances?) and to take on current-day questions from a genealogical perspective. What is software? How did it appear as a concept, in what industrial and governmental circumstances? What happens to the material conditions of its production (minerals, factory labor, hardware) when it evaporates into a cloud?\n\nThe second two days were spent focusing on the space-time dimension of IT development. The way computer programs and operating systems are manufactured has changed tremendously over the last seventy years, as has its production times and places. From military labs to the mega-corporation cubicles to the open-space freelancer utopia, what ruptures and continuities can be traced in the production, deployment, maintenance and destruction of software? From time-sharing to user-space partitions and containerization, what separations were and are at work? Where and when is software made today?\n\nThe last two days at the Techno-Galactic Software Observatory were dedicated to observation and its consequences. The development of software encompasses a series of practices whose evocative names are increasingly familiar: feedback, report, probe, audit, inspect, scan, diagnose, explore, test. What are the systems of knowledge and power within which these activities take place, and what other types of observation are possible? As a practical set for our investigations, we set up a walk-in clinic on the 25th floor of the World Trade Center, where users and developers could arrive with software-questions of all kinds.\n\n## The Walk-in Clinic (% CARLINSAYS: I think this title should go below the description of the walk-in clinic as the last two days of the observatory worksession and should come instead right above the invitation to the clinic so I have moved it there)\n\n> Do you suffer from the disappearance of your software into the cloud,\n> feel oppressed by unequal user privilege, or experience the torment of\n> software-ransom of any sort?\n> Bring your devices and interfaces to the World Trade Center!\n> With the help of a clear and in-depth session, at the Techno-Galactic\n> Walk-In Clinic we guarantee immediate results.\n> The  Walk-In Clinic provides free hands-on observations to software\n> curious  people of all kinds.

It also seems important to make sure that the two page list of services poster for the clinic is printed on pages that are facing each other. If they are already set to do that then maybe nix my suggestion of moving the intake form up, but if they are not then that would be one way to shift the pages to make that

This guide proposes several ways to achieve critical distance from the seemingly endless software systems that surround us. It offers practical and fantastical tools for the tactical (mis)use of software, empowering/enabling users to resist embedded paradigms and assumptions. It is a collection of methods for approaching software, experiencing its myths and realities, its risks and benefits.\n\nWith the rise of online services, the use of software has increasingly been knitted into the production of software, even while the rhetoric, rights, and procedures continue to suggest that use and production constitute separate realms. This knitting together and its corresponding disavowal have an effect on the way software is used and produced, and radically alters its operative role in society. The shifts ripple across galaxies, through social structures, working conditions and personal relations, resulting in a profusion of apparatuses aspiring to be seamless while optimizing and monetizing individual and collective flows of information in line with the interests of a handful of actors. The diffusion of software services affects the personal, in the form of intensified identity shaping and self-management. It also affects the public, as more and more libraries, universities and public infrastructures as well as the management of public life rely on \"solutions\" provided by private companies. Centralizing data flows in the clouds, services blur the last traces of the thin line that separates bio- from necro-politics.\n\nGiven how fast these changes resonate and reproduce, there is a growing urgency to engage in a critique of software that goes beyond taking a distance, and that deals with the fact that we are inevitably already entangled. How can we interact, intervene, respond and think with software? What approaches can allow us to recognize the agency of different actors, their ways of functioning and their politics? What methods of observation enable critical inquiry and affirmative discord? What techniques can we apply to resurface software where it has melted into the infrastructure and into the everyday? How can we remember that software is always at work, especially where it is designed to disappear into the background?\n\nWe adopted the term of observation for a number of reasons. We regard observation as a way to approach software, as one way to organize engagement with its implications. Observation, and the enabling of observation through intensive data-centric feedback mechanisms, is part of  the cybernetic principles that underpin present day software production. Our aim was to scrutinize this methodology in its many manifestations, including in \"observatories\" -- high cost infrastructures [testing infrastructures?] of observation troubled by colonial, imperial traditions and their problematic divisions of nature and culture -- with the hope of opening up questions about who gets to observe software (and how) and who is being observed by software (and with what impact)? It is a question of power, one that we answer, at least in part, with critical play.\n\nWe adopted the term techno-galactic to match the advertised capability of \"scaling up to the universe\" that comes in contemporary paradigms of computation, and to address different scales of software communities and related political economies that involve and require observation.\n\nDrawing on theories of software and computation developed in academia and elsewhere, we grounded our methods in hands-on exercises and experiments that you now can try at home. This Guide to Techno-Galactic Software Observation offers methods developed in and inspired by the context of software production, hacker culture, software studies, computer science research, Free Software communities, privacy activism, and artistic practice. It invites you to experiment with ways to stay with the trouble of software.\n\n\n% http://observatory.constantvzw.org/images/friday/P1010328.JPG\n% SHOW: Etgsoimages.svg tgsoteam\n% INFO: Techno-Galactic Software Observation team, WTC Brussels, June 2017\n\n## The Techno-Galactic Software Observatory\n\nIn the summer of 2017, around thirty people gathered in Brussels to explore practices of proximate critique with and of software in the context of a worksession entitled \"Techno-Galactic Software Observatory\".[^]{Worksessions are intensive transdisciplinary moments, organised twice a year by Constant.

During three sessions of two days, participants collectively inspected the space-time of computation and probed the universe of hardware-software separations through excursions, exercises and conversations.

It is neither revolutionary [@marx:1848:cmanifesto] nor is it a global scale vulnerability [@meltdown:2018:spectre17], but no matter where you happen to be, there is the spectre of a software running somewhere in the background. Look! There it is, looking right back at you. Be it your phone screen or a passing satellite, software's observation and entanglement in the everyday appears complete. But is it so total? Let's look more closely. \n\n We find ourselves in a universe built on a 1990s revival of a 1960s dream: software as a service [@haigh:2001:soft60]. In this online universe, the use of software has increasingly been knitted into the production of software, even while the rhetoric, rights, and procedures around software continue to suggest that use and production constitute separate realms. This knitting together and its corresponding disavowal radically alters the operative role of software in society. The shifts ripple across galaxies, through social structures, working conditions, and personal relations, resulting in a profusion of apparatuses that aspire to be seamless while optimizing and monetizing individual and collective flows of information in line with the interests of a handful of actors. The diffusion of software services affects individuals and communities in the form of intensified identity shaping and self-management, and affects the public, as institutions and common use infrastructures increasingly rely on \"solutions\" provided by private companies for their management. As online services increasingly centralize data flows in the clouds, they blur the last traces of the thin line separating bio- from necro-politics.[@hu:2015:prehistory]\n\nAs software spins its web around us, we reflexively try to take some distance only to realize that we are too well tangled in its gooey net. Caught upside down and dangling we ask: How can we interact, respond to, and think with software? What approaches can we use to recognize the agency of different actors, their ways of working, and their politics? What methods of observation are conducive to critical inquiry and affirmative discord? How can we resurface software, to find sites where its infrastructures are reconfiguring the everyday? How can we take stock of the ways software is always at work, especially where it is designed to disappear into the background?\n\nBowled over by these questions, by constant pop-ups and push notifications, a fantasy takes shape of smashing our devices with a sledge hammer, throwing them in the river, retreating off grid and out of sight, and living software free lives. But this fantasy that cannot hold. It cannot hold us. Perhaps it is available to the tech-biilionaires building and stocking bunkers, but for most of the people on this planet, for the poorest, for the less and least powerful, for someone who is almost anyone having a sudden software tantrum, it is not going to do it. We are in search of a better fantasy. One that lets us poke and push back. \n\nTogether, we pick up the word \"observation\", turning it over and around. We bri it right up to our noses and held it outstretched to get a better look, holding all of the histories of people looking at others and objects in mind, holding terminals (%CARLINSAYS: is this the right word?) and keyboards in hand. Observation, and the enabling of it through intensive data-centric feedback mechanisms, is part of the cybernetic spells that underpin present day software production. In this present moment, we sync our breath to the rhythm of our software and propose holistic observation as one way to enter an engagement with software's implications. \n\n(%CARLINSAYS: This guide is one answer to these questions, and it tickles.)\nThe Techno-Galactic Software Survival Guide (%CARLINSAYS: use agreed title) is an obsessive fantasy of optimization turned on its head, and stuck to the ceiling of a self-reflecting elevator. It is the ultimate book of dos and don'ts, of forgotten histories and un-inevitable futures, of mindful agile actions and improvisational service architectures, of any and all things that you can and cannot imagine needing in a techno-galaxy.  \n\nThis guide offers a set of practical and fantastical tools for the tactical (mis)use of software, empowering/enabling users to resist embedded paradigms and assumptions. It is a collection of methods for approaching software, experiencing its myths and realities, its risks and benefits. Drawing on theories of software and computation developed in academia and elsewhere, (%CARLINSAYS: BUMP, maybe introduce the event and us here so that it is clear who the \"we\" is here... At TGSO we developed the state of art methods for you.) we grounded our methods in hands-on exercises and experiments that you now can try at home. This Guide to Techno-Galactic Software Observation (%CARLINSAYS: use agreed title) offers methods developed in and inspired by the context of software production, hacker culture, software studies, computer science research, Free Software communities, privacy activism, and artistic practice. It invites you to experiment with ways to stay with the trouble of software. We are techno-galactic as we meet the contemporary paradigms of computation that proudly announce their capability for \"scaling up to the universe.\" We stand here as modest witnesses to the scales of software communities and related political economies that involve and require observation. Reading is not enough, software is not just a text, observation is one potential beginning, engagement is tickling. \n\nCan you call up that feeling of the approach of a touch that cannot be born with a straight face? Come join us at the edge of the universe, on the metro platform, at your kitchen table, as we mark and measure critical distances from and entanglements with the seemingly endless software systems that surround us.\n\n\nThe techno-galactic software survival guide (%CARLINSAYS: use agreed title) was collectively produced as an outcome of the Techno-Galactic Software Observatory. \n[This feels like it could be in a different font size or in brackets or is the start of the next page/spread?]\n\n\nkostas axelos, planetary interlude, maybe some bits fit with the intro?:\n\n%  We open ourselves to abysses and we are swallowed up in sys-\n%  tems and totalizations - for these are fragments and segments of\n%  \"totality\" which establish themselves as total and/or partial totali-\n%  tarisms - without foreseeing what might be the home, the house, the\n%  habitat of living, thinking man, an unfinished, unfinishable being in a\n%  history which is equally so, neither a shell stuck fast to a rock, nor a\n%  simple nomad or vagabond. Mortals wish for the familiar and for\n%  adventure, the known and the unknown, undecided as to who decides\n%  and to what he decides, chosen rather than choosing. Since they are\n%  unable to be their own master, they allow themselves to be fixed,\n%  tossed about, carried away, scattered and put to flight, incapable of\n%  choosing - if choice there be - between success in and in relation to\n%  the world, and the World. All this does not constitute an error; wan-\n%  dering (errance) commands it. \n Galactic irony is watching us. \n%  Dream of a shadow and dispenser of light, conquistador and\n%  deserter of the World, pawn and pioneer, man sets out to conquer\n%  the stars and he ploughs the sea. The assault he launches against the\n%  astral earth and against the celestial stars is not without disaster.\n Whether he delves into analysis and disintegration -- since he needs\n analyses, concrete and tangible solutions and experimentations -- or\n whether he plunges into syntheses -- since the abstracting power and\n the ungraspable attract him equally --, as precisely and as far as he\n may cast his nets, what his nets catch and what passes through them\n communicate. Never quite awake and never quite beclouded, will we\n learn to live and to see beings and things simultaneously from close\n up and far away, large and small, in their and in our wandering\n (errance), in the great World which is at the same time small, where\n there are no victors - would there be vanquished?\n\n## The Techno-Galactic Software Observatory\n\nIn the summer of 2017, thirty or so people gathered in Brussels to explore practices of proximate critique with and of software in the context of a worksession entitled \"Techno-Galactic Software Observatory\".[^]{Worksessions are intensive transdisciplinary moments, organised twice a year by Constant.

If they are already set to do that then maybe nix my suggestion of moving the intake form up, but if they are not then that would be one way to shift the pages to make that happen.)\n\n\n","attribs":"*0+n+1*7+3*0|2+2*7+2+2*6+1+8*6+1+6*6+1+8*6+1+8*6+1+a*6+3*7+1*6+5o|2+2+1q*0|1+1+1s*0|1+1+1p*0|1+1+18*6|1+1|1+q*b|1+1*6+1r*0+1*e+b*6+1f*0+1*e+n*6+7*e+1*6+1g*e+1*6+3q*e+a*6+z*e+m*6+1s*e|2+2*6+2p*e+l*6+q*e+37*6+1*e+f*6+g*e+41*6+3*e+g*6+c*e+2k*6+1*e+1t*6+c*e+58*6+r*e+1s*6+h*e+c*6+d*e+4*6+b*e+26*6+8*e+2*6+b*e+2*6+x*e+8*6+2*e+q*6+4*e+t*6+5*e+6*6+9*e+q*6+l*e|2+2*6+2*e+z*6+w*e+9*6+8*e+d*6+u*e+a*6+15*e+1*6|2+do*6+2d*e+c*6+5w*e+z*6+u*e+2*6+1b*e+b*6+12*e+1*6+10*e+2*6+g*e+7*6+1*e+1*6+2*e+n*6+24*e|1+1*6|2+i2*9|1+1*6|3+ea*6+ad*e+4e*6|2+o6*6+5l*6*d+q*6+2d*9|1+1*6|3+4k*6*j+32*6|2+2*f|3+23*0*c+2*a*c+1p*a|1+1*0*c+2*a*c+1t*a|1+1*0*c+2*a*c+1y*a|1+1*0*c+2*a*c+1w*a|1+1*0*c+2*a*c+20*a|1+1*0*c+2*a*c+21*a|1+1*0*c+2*a*c+1s*a|1+1*0*c+2*a*c+1u*a|1+1*0*c+2*a*c+1w*a|1+1*0*c+2*a*c+1u*0|1+1*0*c+2*a*c+1y*a|1+1*0*c+2*a*c+1y*a|1+1*0*c+2*a*c+1y*a|1+1*0*c+2*a*c+v*f|1+1*f*1+v*f+1*a|1+1*0+2*a+1*a*c+1m*a|1+1*0*c+2*a*c+1t*a|1+1*0*c+2*a*c+1y*a|1+1*0*c+2*a*c+1y*f|1+1*f+1g*0+1*f|1+h*f+1s*0+1*f|1+5*f+z*0+1*f|1+y*f+11*0+1*f|7+bt|1+1+17*0|1+1|1+1+t*6+6+4s*0+1+1*0+1+1*0+b3*9+m*0+1+3w*6+b+11*6+1+3c*6+9+9*6+5|2+8y+3p*0+1+1*0+m+15*0+1o+2*6+d+1v*6+b+w*6+2g+2*6+h+1*6+8*9+3+16*6+a+b*6+x|2+88+m*6+h+35*6+4+l*6+4+2*6+l+3*6+5+1h*6+2|2+95+w*6+1+8*6+1+8*6+1+6s*6+2|1+95*6|2+72|1+1*0+2*1+1x*0|1+1*0+2*1+1y*0|1+1*0+2*1+s*0|1+1*0+2*1+1o*0|1+1*0+2*1+1x*0|1+1*0+2*1+1a|1+1*0+2*1+1v*0|1+1*0+2*1+1z*0|1+1*0+2*1+1z*0|1+1*0+2*1+21*0|1+1*0+2*1+1x*0|1+1*0+2*1+1t*0|1+1*0*1+2*1+1d*0|1+1*0+2*1+10*0|1+1*0+2*1+l|1+1*0+7+16*0+1|2+2*0+2+n*0|1+1*0+2+1j*7|1+1*0+2|1+1f*7|5+6h*7+1r*0|1+1*7|2+46*0|1+1*6+cs*a|1+1*6|1+1|1+1"}}},"pad:observatory.guide.introduction:revs:6001":{"changeset":"Z:b5t>2|i=2rl=27*6+2$ng","meta":{"author":"a.EXnmpSWanmHBGv1u","timestamp":1520213445432}},"pad:observatory.guide.introduction:revs:6002":{"changeset":"Z:b5v<i2|i=2rl-i2$","meta":{"author":"a.EXnmpSWanmHBGv1u","timestamp":1520213473543}},"pad:observatory.guide.introduction:revs:6003":{"changeset":"Z:ant<1|h=2rk|1-1$","meta":{"author":"a.EXnmpSWanmHBGv1u","timestamp":1520213474036}},"pad:observatory.guide.introduction:revs:6004":{"changeset":"Z:ans<1|g=29u=hp|1-1$","meta":{"author":"a.EXnmpSWanmHBGv1u","timestamp":1520213474537}},"pad:observatory.guide.introduction:revs:6005":{"changeset":"Z:anr>1|k=35u*6|1+1$\n","meta":{"author":"a.EXnmpSWanmHBGv1u","timestamp":1520213476084}},"pad:observatory.guide.introduction:revs:6006":{"changeset":"Z:ans>i2|l=35v*6+i2$Together, we pick up the word \"observation\", turning it over and around.

It is neither revolutionary [@marx:1848:cmanifesto] nor is it a global scale vulnerability [@meltdown:2018:spectre17], but no matter where you happen to be, there is the spectre of a software running somewhere in the background. Look! There it is, looking right back at you. Be it your phone screen or a passing satellite, software's observation and entanglement in the everyday appears complete. But is it so total? Let's look more closely. \n\n We find ourselves in a universe built on a 1990s revival of a 1960s dream: software as a service [@haigh:2001:soft60]. In this online universe, the use of software has increasingly been knitted into the production of software, even while the rhetoric, rights, and procedures around software continue to suggest that use and production constitute separate realms. This knitting together and its corresponding disavowal radically alters the operative role of software in society. The shifts ripple across galaxies, through social structures, working conditions, and personal relations, resulting in a profusion of apparatuses that aspire to be seamless while optimizing and monetizing individual and collective flows of information in line with the interests of a handful of actors. The diffusion of software services affects individuals and communities in the form of intensified identity shaping and self-management, and affects the public, as institutions and common use infrastructures increasingly rely on \"solutions\" provided by private companies for their management. As online services increasingly centralize data flows in the clouds, they blur the last traces of the thin line separating bio- from necro-politics.[@hu:2015:prehistory]\n\nAs software spins its web around us, we reflexively try to take some distance only to realize that we are too well tangled in its gooey net. Caught upside down and dangling we ask: How can we interact, respond to, and think with software? What approaches can we use to recognize the agency of different actors, their ways of working, and their politics? What methods of observation are conducive to critical inquiry and affirmative discord? How can we resurface software, to find sites where its infrastructures are reconfiguring the everyday? How can we take stock of the ways software is always at work, especially where it is designed to disappear into the background?\n\nBowled over by these questions, by constant pop-ups and push notifications, a fantasy takes shape of smashing our devices with a sledge hammer, throwing them in the river, retreating off grid and out of sight, and living software free lives. But this fantasy that cannot hold. It cannot hold us. Perhaps it is available to the tech-biilionaires building and stocking bunkers, but for most of the people on this planet, for the poorest, for the less and least powerful, for someone who is almost anyone having a sudden software tantrum, it is not going to do it. We are in search of a better fantasy. One that lets us poke and push back. \n\nThe Techno-Galactic Software Survival Guide (%CARLINSAYS: use agreed title) is an obsessive fantasy of optimization turned on its head, and stuck to the ceiling of a self-reflecting elevator. It is the ultimate book of dos and don'ts, of forgotten histories and un-inevitable futures, of mindful agile actions and improvisational service architectures, of any and all things that you can and cannot imagine needing in a techno-galaxy. \n\nIn t a set of practical and fantastical tools for the tactical (mis)use of software, empowering/enabling users to resist embedded paradigms and assumptions. It is a collection of methods for approaching software, experiencing its myths and realities, its risks and benefits. Drawing on theories of software and computation developed in academia and elsewhere, (%CARLINSAYS: BUMP, maybe introduce the event and us here so that it is clear who the \"we\" is here... At TGSO we developed the state of art methods for you.) we grounded our methods in hands-on exercises and experiments that you now can try at home. This Guide to Techno-Galactic Software Observation (%CARLINSAYS: use agreed title) offers methods developed in and inspired by the context of software production, hacker culture, software studies, computer science research, Free Software communities, privacy activism, and artistic practice. It invites you to experiment with ways to stay with the trouble of software. \n\nAt the Techno-Galactic Software Observatory worksession we developed state of the art methods that we now offer to you. Together, we pick up the word \"observation\", turning it over and around. We bring it right up to our noses and held it outstretched to get a better look, holding all of the histories of people looking at others and objects in mind, holding terminals (%CARLINSAYS: is this the right word?) and keyboards in hand. Observation, and the enabling of it through intensive data-centric feedback mechanisms, is part of the cybernetic spells that underpin present day software production. In this present moment, we sync our breath to the rhythm of our software and propose holistic observation as one way to enter an engagement with software's implications. \n\nWe are techno-galactic as we meet the contemporary paradigms of computation that proudly announce their capability for \"scaling up to the universe.\" We stand here as modest witnesses to the scales of software communities and related political economies that involve and require observation. Reading is not enough, software is not just a text, observation is one potential beginning, engagement is tickling. \n\nCan you call up that feeling of the approach of a touch that cannot be born with a straight face? Come join us at the edge of the universe, on the metro platform, at your kitchen table, as we mark and measure critical distances from and entanglements with the seemingly endless software systems that surround us.\n\n\nThe techno-galactic software survival guide (%CARLINSAYS: use agreed title) was collectively produced as an outcome of the Techno-Galactic Software Observatory. \n[This feels like it could be in a different font size or in brackets or is the start of the next page/spread?]\n\n\nkostas axelos, planetary interlude, maybe some bits fit with the intro?:\n\n%  We open ourselves to abysses and we are swallowed up in sys-\n%  tems and totalizations - for these are fragments and segments of\n%  \"totality\" which establish themselves as total and/or partial totali-\n%  tarisms - without foreseeing what might be the home, the house, the\n%  habitat of living, thinking man, an unfinished, unfinishable being in a\n%  history which is equally so, neither a shell stuck fast to a rock, nor a\n%  simple nomad or vagabond. Mortals wish for the familiar and for\n%  adventure, the known and the unknown, undecided as to who decides\n%  and to what he decides, chosen rather than choosing. Since they are\n%  unable to be their own master, they allow themselves to be fixed,\n%  tossed about, carried away, scattered and put to flight, incapable of\n%  choosing - if choice there be - between success in and in relation to\n%  the world, and the World. All this does not constitute an error; wan-\n%  dering (errance) commands it. \n Galactic irony is watching us. \n%  Dream of a shadow and dispenser of light, conquistador and\n%  deserter of the World, pawn and pioneer, man sets out to conquer\n%  the stars and he ploughs the sea. The assault he launches against the\n%  astral earth and against the celestial stars is not without disaster.\n Whether he delves into analysis and disintegration -- since he needs\n analyses, concrete and tangible solutions and experimentations -- or\n whether he plunges into syntheses -- since the abstracting power and\n the ungraspable attract him equally --, as precisely and as far as he\n may cast his nets, what his nets catch and what passes through them\n communicate. Never quite awake and never quite beclouded, will we\n learn to live and to see beings and things simultaneously from close\n up and far away, large and small, in their and in our wandering\n (errance), in the great World which is at the same time small, where\n there are no victors - would there be vanquished?\n\n## The Techno-Galactic Software Observatory\n\nIn the summer of 2017, thirty or so people gathered in Brussels to explore practices of proximate critique with and of software in the context of a worksession entitled \"Techno-Galactic Software Observatory\".[^]{Worksessions are intensive transdisciplinary moments, organised twice a year by Constant. They aim to provide conditions for participants with different experiences and capabilities to temporarily link their practice and to  develop ideas, prototypes and  research projects together. For the worksessions, primarily Free, Libre and Open Source software is used and material that is available under Open Content Licenses.} The worksession called for software-curious people of all kinds to ask questions about software. The intuition behind such a call was that developing different types of engagement requires a heterogeneous group of participants with different levels of expertise,  skill and background. During three sessions that were two days each, participants collectively inspected the space-time of computation and probed the universe of hardware-software separations through excursions, exercises and conversations. They tried out various perspectives and methods to look at the larger picture of software as a concept, as a practice, and as a set of techniques.\n\nThe first two days of The Techno-Galactic Software Observatory included visits to the Musée de l'Informatique Pionnière en Belgique [^]{http://www.nam-ip.be} in Namur and the Computermuseum KULeuven[^]{http://etwie.be/database/actor/computermuseum-ku-leuven}. Surrounded by these collections of historical ’numerical artefacts’, we started considering software in a long-term context (% CARLINSAYS: Do we mean a long historical context or longue duree or something else?). The museum visits provided an occasion to reflect on the conditions of software's appearance (% CARLINSAYS: appearances?) and to take on current-day questions from a genealogical perspective. What is software? How did it appear as a concept, in what industrial and governmental circumstances? What happens to the material conditions of its production (minerals, factory labor, hardware) when it evaporates into a cloud?\n\nThe second two days were spent focusing on the space-time dimension of IT development. The way computer programs and operating systems are manufactured has changed tremendously over the last seventy years, as has its production times and places. From military labs to the mega-corporation cubicles to the open-space freelancer utopia, what ruptures and continuities can be traced in the production, deployment, maintenance and destruction of software? From time-sharing to user-space partitions and containerization, what separations were and are at work? Where and when is software made today?\n\nThe last two days at the Techno-Galactic Software Observatory were dedicated to observation and its consequences. The development of software encompasses a series of practices whose evocative names are increasingly familiar: feedback, report, probe, audit, inspect, scan, diagnose, explore, test. What are the systems of knowledge and power within which these activities take place, and what other types of observation are possible? As a practical set for our investigations, we set up a walk-in clinic on the 25th floor of the World Trade Center, where users and developers could arrive with software-questions of all kinds.\n\n## The Walk-in Clinic (% CARLINSAYS: I think this title should go below the description of the walk-in clinic as the last two days of the observatory worksession and should come instead right above the invitation to the clinic so I have moved it there)\n\n> Do you suffer from the disappearance of your software into the cloud,\n> feel oppressed by unequal user privilege, or experience the torment of\n> software-ransom of any sort?\n> Bring your devices and interfaces to the World Trade Center!\n> With the help of a clear and in-depth session, at the Techno-Galactic\n> Walk-In Clinic we guarantee immediate results.\n> The  Walk-In Clinic provides free hands-on observations to software\n> curious  people of all kinds.

TOCITEM: Introduction T:4\n\n# A Guide to Techno-Galactic Software Observation (% CARLINSAYS: is our title \"A Guide to Techno-Galactic Software Observation\" or \"The Techno-Galactic Guide to Software Observation\" or \"The Techno-Galactic Software Survival Guide\" or some other iteration?)\n\n> I am less interested in the critical practice of reflection,\n> of showing once-again that the emperor has no clothes, than in\n> finding a way to diffract critical inquiry in order to make\n> difference patterns in a more worldly way.\n> [@haraway:1996:witness]\n\nA spectre is haunting the galaxy. It is neither revolutionary [@marx:1848:cmanifesto] nor is it a global scale vulnerability [@meltdown:2018:spectre17], but no matter where you happen to be, there is the spectre of a software running somewhere in the background. Look! There it is, looking right back at you. Be it your phone screen or a passing satellite, software's observation and entanglement in the everyday appears complete. But is it so total? Let's look more closely. \n\n We find ourselves in a universe built on a 1990s revival of a 1960s dream: software as a service [@haigh:2001:soft60]. In this online universe, the use of software has increasingly been knitted into the production of software, even while the rhetoric, rights, and procedures around software continue to suggest that use and production constitute separate realms. This knitting together and its corresponding disavowal radically alters the operative role of software in society. The shifts ripple across galaxies, through social structures, working conditions, and personal relations, resulting in a profusion of apparatuses that aspire to be seamless while optimizing and monetizing individual and collective flows of information in line with the interests of a handful of actors. The diffusion of software services affects individuals and communities in the form of intensified identity shaping and self-management, and affects the public, as institutions and common use infrastructures increasingly rely on \"solutions\" provided by private companies for their management. As online services increasingly centralize data flows in the clouds, they blur the last traces of the thin line separating bio- from necro-politics.[@hu:2015:prehistory]\n\nAs software spins its web around us, we reflexively try to take some distance only to realize that we are too well tangled in its gooey net. Caught upside down and dangling we ask: How can we interact, respond to, and think with software? What approaches can we use to recognize the agency of different actors, their ways of working, and their politics? What methods of observation are conducive to critical inquiry and affirmative discord? How can we resurface software, to find sites where its infrastructures are reconfiguring the everyday? How can we take stock of the ways software is always at work, especially where it is designed to disappear into the background?\n\nBowled over by these questions, by constant pop-ups and push notifications, a fantasy takes shape of smashing our devices with a sledge hammer, throwing them in the river, retreating off grid and out of sight, and living software free lives. But this fantasy that cannot hold. It cannot hold us. Perhaps it is available to the tech-biilionaires building and stocking bunkers, but for most of the people on this planet, for the poorest, for the less and least powerful, for someone who is almost anyone having a sudden software tantrum, it is not going to do it. We are in search of a better fantasy. One that lets us poke and push back. \n\nThe Techno-Galactic Software Survival Guide (% CARLINSAYS: use agreed title) is an obsessive fantasy of optimization turned on its head, and stuck to the ceiling of a self-reflecting elevator. It is the ultimate book of dos and don'ts, of forgotten histories and un-inevitable futures, of mindful agile actions and improvisational service architectures, of any and all things that you can and cannot imagine needing in a techno-galaxy. We are techno-galactic in order to meet the contemporary paradigms of computation that proudly announce their capability for \"scaling up to the universe.\" We stand here as modest witnesses to the scales of software communities and related political economies that involve and require observation.\n\nAt the Techno-Galactic Software Observatory worksession we developed state of the art methods that we now offer to you. To do this, we picked up the word \"observation\", turning it over and around. We brought it right up to our noses and held it outstretched to get a better look, holding all of the histories of people looking at others and objects in mind, holding computers and keyboards in hand. Observation, and the enabling of it through intensive data-centric feedback mechanisms, is part of the cybernetic spells that underpin present day software production. In this present moment, we sync our breath to the rhythm of our software and propose holistic observation as one way to enter an engagement with software's implications. \n\nThis guide invites you to experiment with ways to stay with the trouble of software. In it you will find a set of practical and fantastical tools for the tactical (mis)use of software, empowering and enabling users to resist embedded paradigms and assumptions. It is a collection of methods for approaching software, experiencing its myths and realities, its risks and benefits. Drawing on theories of software and computation developed in academia and elsewhere, we grounded our methods in hands-on exercises and experiments that you now can try at home. These methods were developed in and inspired by the context of software production, hacker culture, software studies, computer science research, Free Software communities, privacy activism, and artistic practice. \n\nReading is not enough, software is not just a text, observation is one potential beginning, engagement is tickling. Can you call up that feeling of the approach of a touch that cannot be born with a straight face? Come join us at the edge of the universe, on the metro platform, at your kitchen table, as we mark and measure critical distances from and entanglements with the seemingly endless software systems that surround us.\n\n\nThe techno-galactic software survival guide (% CARLINSAYS: use agreed title) was collectively produced as an outcome of the Techno-Galactic Software Observatory. \n(% CARLINSAYS: This feels like it could be in a different font size or in brackets or is the start of the next page/spread?)\n\n\n% CARLINSAYS\nkostas axelos, planetary interlude, maybe some bits fit with the intro?:\n\n Whether he delves into analysis and disintegration -- since he needs\n analyses, concrete and tangible solutions and experimentations -- or\n whether he plunges into syntheses -- since the abstracting power and\n the ungraspable attract him equally --, as precisely and as far as he\n may cast his nets, what his nets catch and what passes through them\n communicate. Never quite awake and never quite beclouded, will we\n learn to live and to see beings and things simultaneously from close\n up and far away, large and small, in their and in our wandering\n (errance), in the great World which is at the same time small, where\n there are no victors - would there be vanquished?\n\n## The Techno-Galactic Software Observatory\n\nIn the summer of 2017, thirty or so people gathered in Brussels to explore practices of proximate critique with and of software in the context of a worksession entitled \"Techno-Galactic Software Observatory\".[^]{Worksessions are intensive transdisciplinary moments, organised twice a year by Constant. They aim to provide conditions for participants with different experiences and capabilities to temporarily link their practice and to  develop ideas, prototypes and  research projects together. For the worksessions, primarily Free, Libre and Open Source software is used and material that is available under Open Content Licenses.} The worksession called for software-curious people of all kinds to ask questions about software. The intuition behind such a call was that developing different types of engagement requires a heterogeneous group of participants with different levels of expertise,  skill and background. During three sessions that were two days each, participants collectively inspected the space-time of computation and probed the universe of hardware-software separations through excursions, exercises and conversations. They tried out various perspectives and methods to look at the larger picture of software as a concept, as a practice, and as a set of techniques.\n\nThe first two days of The Techno-Galactic Software Observatory included visits to the Musée de l'Informatique Pionnière en Belgique [^]{http://www.nam-ip.be} in Namur and the Computermuseum KULeuven[^]{http://etwie.be/database/actor/computermuseum-ku-leuven}. Surrounded by these collections of historical ’numerical artefacts’, we started considering software in a long-term context (% CARLINSAYS: Do we mean a long historical context or longue duree or something else?). The museum visits provided an occasion to reflect on the conditions of software's appearance (% CARLINSAYS: appearances?) and to take on current-day questions from a genealogical perspective. What is software? How did it appear as a concept, in what industrial and governmental circumstances? What happens to the material conditions of its production (minerals, factory labor, hardware) when it evaporates into a cloud?\n\nThe second two days were spent focusing on the space-time dimension of IT development. The way computer programs and operating systems are manufactured has changed tremendously over the last seventy years, as has its production times and places. From military labs to the mega-corporation cubicles to the open-space freelancer utopia, what ruptures and continuities can be traced in the production, deployment, maintenance and destruction of software? From time-sharing to user-space partitions and containerization, what separations were and are at work? Where and when is software made today?\n\nThe last two days at the Techno-Galactic Software Observatory were dedicated to observation and its consequences. The development of software encompasses a series of practices whose evocative names are increasingly familiar: feedback, report, probe, audit, inspect, scan, diagnose, explore, test. What are the systems of knowledge and power within which these activities take place, and what other types of observation are possible? As a practical set for our investigations, we set up a walk-in clinic on the 25th floor of the World Trade Center, where users and developers could arrive with software-questions of all kinds.\n\n## The Walk-in Clinic (% CARLINSAYS: I think this title should go below the description of the walk-in clinic as the last two days of the observatory worksession and should come instead right above the invitation to the clinic so I have moved it there)\n\n> Do you suffer from the disappearance of your software into the cloud,\n> feel oppressed by unequal user privilege, or experience the torment of\n> software-ransom of any sort?\n> Bring your devices and interfaces to the World Trade Center!\n> With the help of a clear and in-depth session, at the Techno-Galactic\n> Walk-In Clinic we guarantee immediate results.\n> The  Walk-In Clinic provides free hands-on observations to software\n> curious  people of all kinds.

It also seems important to make sure that the two page list of services poster for the clinic is printed on pages that are facing each other. If they are already set to do that then maybe nix my suggestion of moving the intake form up, but if they are not then that would be one way to shift the pages to make that happen.)\n\n\n","attribs":"*0+n+1*7+3*0|2+2*7+2+2*6+1+8*6+1+6*6+1+8*6+1+8*6+1+a*6+3*7+1*6+5o|2+2+1q*0|1+1+1s*0|1+1+1p*0|1+1+18*6|1+1|1+q*b|1+1*6+1r*0+1*e+b*6+1f*0+1*e+n*6+7*e+1*6+1g*e+1*6+3q*e+a*6+z*e+m*6+1s*e|2+2*6+2p*e+l*6+q*e+37*6+1*e+f*6+g*e+41*6+3*e+g*6+c*e+2k*6+1*e+1t*6+c*e+58*6+r*e+1s*6+h*e+c*6+d*e+4*6+b*e+26*6+8*e+2*6+b*e+2*6+x*e+8*6+2*e+q*6+4*e+t*6+5*e+6*6+9*e+q*6+l*e|2+2*6+2*e+z*6+w*e+9*6+8*e+d*6+u*e+a*6+15*e+1*6|2+do*6+2d*e+c*6+5w*e+z*6+u*e+2*6+1b*e+b*6+12*e+1*6+10*e+2*6+g*e+7*6+1*e+1*6+2*e+n*6|8+1si*6+8t*6*d+q*6+2d*9|1+1*6|3+4l*6*j+3g*6|2+2*f|1+1*6|1+d*f|2+22*f+1g*0+1*f|1+h*f+1s*0+1*f|1+5*f+z*0+1*f|1+y*f+11*0+1*f|7+bt|1+1+17*0|1+1|1+1+t*6+6+4s*0+1+1*0+1+1*0+b3*9+m*0+1+3w*6+b+11*6+1+3c*6+9+9*6+5|2+8y+3p*0+1+1*0+m+15*0+1o+2*6+d+1v*6+b+w*6+2g+2*6+h+1*6+8*9+3+16*6+a+b*6+x|2+88+m*6+h+35*6+4+l*6+4+2*6+l+3*6+5+1h*6+2|2+95+w*6+1+8*6+1+8*6+1+6s*6+2|1+95*6|2+72|1+1*0+2*1+1x*0|1+1*0+2*1+1y*0|1+1*0+2*1+s*0|1+1*0+2*1+1o*0|1+1*0+2*1+1x*0|1+1*0+2*1+1a|1+1*0+2*1+1v*0|1+1*0+2*1+1z*0|1+1*0+2*1+1z*0|1+1*0+2*1+21*0|1+1*0+2*1+1x*0|1+1*0+2*1+1t*0|1+1*0*1+2*1+1d*0|1+1*0+2*1+10*0|1+1*0+2*1+l|1+1*0+7+16*0+1|2+2*0+2+n*0|1+1*0+2+1j*7|1+1*0+2|1+1f*7|5+6h*7+1r*0|1+1*7|2+46*0|1+1*6+cs*a|1+1*6|1+1|1+1"}}},"pad:observatory.guide.introduction:revs:6201":{"changeset":"Z:a1r>1|v=51y=c*6+1$

spectre is haunting the galaxy. No matter where you happen to be, if you are looking at the worlds around you, there is software running somewhere in the background. Look! There it is, looking right back at you. Be it your phone screen or a passing satellite, software's observation feels complete. Or, is it? The techno-galactic software survival guide that you are reading right now turns this image of a totally observed world on its head, and sets it dancing.\n\nWith the rise of online services, the use of software has increasingly been knitted into the production of software, even while the rhetoric, rights and procedures continue to suggest that use and production constitute separate realms. This knitting together and its corresponding disavowal has an effect on the way software is used and produced that radically alters its operative role in society. The shifts ripple across galaxies, through social structures, working conditions and personal relations, resulting in a profusion of apparatuses aspiring to be seamless while optimizing and monetizing individual and collective flows of information in line with the interests of a handful of actors. The diffusion of software services affects the personal, in the form of intensified identity shaping and self-management. It also affects the public, as more and more libraries, universities and public infrastructures as well as the management of public life rely on \"solutions\" provided by private companies. Centralizing data flows in the clouds, services blur the last traces of the thin line that separates bio- from necro-politics.\n\nGiven how fast these changes resonate and reproduce, there is a growing urgency to engage in a critique of software that goes beyond taking a distance, and that deals with the fact that we are inevitably already entangled. How can we interact, intervene, respond and think with software? What approaches can allow us to recognize the agency of different actors, their ways of functioning and their politics? What methods of observation enable critical inquiry and affirmative discord? What techniques can we apply to resurface software where it has melted into the infrastructure and into the everyday? How can we remember that software is always at work, especially where it is designed to disappear into the background?\n\nWe pick up the word \"observation\", turning it over and around. We peer at this word, holding all of the histories of people looking at other people in mind, holding terminals and keyboards in hand. We regard observation as a way to approach software, as one way to organize engagement with its implications. Observation, and the enabling of observation through intensive data-centric feedback mechanisms, is part of  the cybernetic principles that underpin present day software production. Our aim was to scrutinize this methodology in its many manifestations, including in \"observatories\" -- high cost infrastructures of observation troubled by colonial, imperial, empirical traditions and their problematic divisions of nature and culture. And through scrutiny, we hoped to open up a set of questions about who gets to observe software (and how) and who is being observed by software (and with what impact)? It is a question of power, one that we answer, at least in part, with critical play. But also with slow pedagogy.\n\nWe are techno-galactic because contemporary paradigms of computation proudly announce their capability for \"scaling up to the universe.\" We meet them here at the scale of galaxies to off a counter vision of the scales of software communities and related political economies that involve and require observation.\n\nThis guide offers a set of practical and fantastical tools for the tactical (mis)use of software, empowering/enabling users to resist embedded paradigms and assumptions. It is a collection of methods for approaching software, experiencing its myths and realities, its risks and benefits. Drawing on theories of software and computation developed in academia and elsewhere, we grounded our methods in hands-on exercises and experiments that you now can try at home. This Guide to Techno-Galactic Software Observation offers methods developed in and inspired by the context of software production, hacker culture, software studies, computer science research, Free Software communities, privacy activism, and artistic practice. It invites you to experiment with ways to stay with the trouble of software. Come join us at the edge of the universe, on the metro platform, at your kitchen table, as we mark and measure critical distances from and entanglements with the seemingly endless software systems that surround us.\n\nThe techno-galactic software survival guide was collectively produced as an outcome of the Techno-Galactic Software Observatory. \n[This feels like it could be in a different font

This guide proposes several ways to achieve critical distance from the seemingly endless software systems that surround us. It offers practical and fantastical tools for the tactical (mis)use of software, empowering/enabling users to resist embedded paradigms and assumptions. It is a collection of methods for approaching software, experiencing its myths and realities, its risks and benefits.\n\nWith the rise of online services, the use of software has increasingly been knitted into the production of software, even while the rhetoric, rights, and procedures continue to suggest that use and production constitute separate realms. This knitting together and its corresponding disavowal have an effect on the way software is used and produced, and radically alters its operative role in society. The shifts ripple across galaxies, through social structures, working conditions and personal relations, resulting in a profusion of apparatuses aspiring to be seamless while optimizing and monetizing individual and collective flows of information in line with the interests of a handful of actors. The diffusion of software services affects the personal, in the form of intensified identity shaping and self-management. It also affects the public, as more and more libraries, universities and public infrastructures as well as the management of public life rely on \"solutions\" provided by private companies. Centralizing data flows in the clouds, services blur the last traces of the thin line that separates bio- from necro-politics.\n\nGiven how fast these changes resonate and reproduce, there is a growing urgency to engage in a critique of software that goes beyond taking a distance, and that deals with the fact that we are inevitably already entangled. How can we interact, intervene, respond and think with software? What approaches can allow us to recognize the agency of different actors, their ways of functioning and their politics? What methods of observation enable critical inquiry and affirmative discord? What techniques can we apply to resurface software where it has melted into the infrastructure and into the everyday? How can we remember that software is always at work, especially where it is designed to disappear into the background?\n\nWe adopted the term of observation for a number of reasons. We regard observation as a way to approach software, as one way to organize engagement with its implications. Observation, and the enabling of observation through intensive data-centric feedback mechanisms, is part of  the cybernetic principles that underpin present day software production. Our aim was to scrutinize this methodology in its many manifestations, including in \"observatories\" -- high cost infrastructures [testing infrastructures?] of observation troubled by colonial, imperial traditions and their problematic divisions of nature and culture -- with the hope of opening up questions about who gets to observe software (and how) and who is being observed by software (and with what impact)? It is a question of power, one that we answer, at least in part, with critical play.\n\nWe adopted the term techno-galactic to match the advertised capability of \"scaling up to the universe\" that comes in contemporary paradigms of computation, and to address different scales of software communities and related political economies that involve and require observation.\n\nDrawing on theories of software and computation developed in academia and elsewhere, we grounded our methods in hands-on exercises and experiments that you now can try at home. This Guide to Techno-Galactic Software Observation offers methods developed in and inspired by the context of software production, hacker culture, software studies, computer science research, Free Software communities, privacy activism, and artistic practice. It invites you to experiment with ways to stay with the trouble of software.\n\n\nA spectre is haunting the galaxy. No matter where you happen to be, if you are looking at the worlds around you, there is software running somewhere in the background. Look! There it is, looking right back at you. Be it your phone screen or a passing satellite, software's observation feels complete. Or, is it? The techno-galactic software survival guide that you are reading right now turns this image of a totally observed world on its head, and sets it dancing.\n\nWith the rise of online services, the use of software has increasingly been knitted into the production of software, even while the rhetoric, rights and procedures continue to suggest that use and production constitute separate realms.

They aim to provide conditions for participants with different experiences and capabilities to temporarily link their practice and to  develop ideas, prototypes and  research projects together. For the worksessions, primarily Free, Libre and Open Source software is used and material that is available under Open Content Licenses.} The worksession called for software-curious people of all kinds to ask questions about software. The intuition behind such a call was that different types of engagement requires a heterogeneous group of participants with different levels of expertise,  skill and background. During three sessions of two days, participants collectively inspected the space-time of computation and probed the universe of hardware-software separations through excursions, exercises and conversations. They tried out various perspectives and methods to look at the larger picture of software as a concept, as a practice, and as a set of techniques.\n\nThe first two days of The Techno-Galactic Software Observatory included visits to the Musée de l'Informatique Pionnière en Belgique [^]{http://www.nam-ip.be} in Namur and the Computermuseum KULeuven[^]{http://www.etwie.be/database/actor/computermuseum-ku-leuven}. In the surroundings of these collections of historical ’numerical artefacts’, we started viewing software in a long-term context. It was an occasion to reflect on the conditions of its appearance, and allowed us to take on current-day questions from a genealogical perspective. What is software? How did it appear as a concept, in what industrial and governmental circumstances? What happens to the material conditions of its production (minerals, factory labor, hardware) when it evaporates into a cloud?\n\nThe second two days we focused on the space-time dimension of IT development. The way computer programs and operating systems are manufactured changed tremendously through time, and so did its production times and places. From military labs via the mega-corporation cubicles to the open-space freelancer utopia, what ruptures and continuities can be traced in the production, deployment, maintenance and destruction of software? From time-sharing to user-space partitions and containerization, what separations were and are at work? Where and when is software made today?\n\n% SHOW: tgsoimages.svg tgsoview N\n\n\n% http://gallery.constantvzw.org/index.php/Techno-Galactic-Software-Observatory/IMAG1399\n% SHOW: tgsoimages.svg scppath\n% INFO: Documenting the path of a Software Curious Person going through the Walk-in Clinic\n\n## The Walk-in Clinic\n\nThe last two days at the Techno-galactic software observatory were dedicated to observation and its consequences. The development of software encompasses a series of practices whose evocative names are increasingly familiar: feedback, report, probe, audit, inspect, scan, diagnose, explore, test ... What are the systems of knowledge and power within which these activities take place, and what other types of observation are possible? As a practical set for our investigations, we set up a walk-in clinic on the 25th floor of the World Trade Center, where users and developers could arrive with software-questions of all kinds.\n\n> Do you suffer from the disappearance of your software into the cloud,\n> feel oppressed by unequal user privilege, or experience the torment of\n> software-ransom of any sort?\n> Bring your devices and interfaces to the World Trade Center!\n> With the help of a clear and in-depth session, at the Techno-Galactic\n> Walk-In Clinic we guarantee immediate results.\n> The  Walk-In Clinic provides free hands-on observations to software\n> curious  people of all kinds.

We regard observation as a way to approach software, as one way to organize engagement with its implications. Observation, and the enabling of it through intensive data-centric feedback mechanisms, is part of  the cybernetic principles that underpin present day software production. Our aim was to scrutinize this methodology in its many manifestations, including in \"observatories\" -- high cost infrastructures of observation troubled by colonial, imperial, empirical traditions and their problematic divisions of nature and culture. And through scrutiny, we hope to open up a set of questions about who gets to observe software (and how) and who is being observed by software (and with what impact)?

The techno-galactic software survival guide that you are reading right now turns this image of a totally observed world on its head, and sets it dancing.\n\nWith the rise of online services, the use of software has increasingly been knitted into the production of software, even while the rhetoric, rights and procedures continue to suggest that use and production constitute separate realms. This knitting together and its corresponding disavowal has an effect on the way software is used and produced that radically alters its operative role in society. The shifts ripple across galaxies, through social structures, working conditions and personal relations, resulting in a profusion of apparatuses aspiring to be seamless while optimizing and monetizing individual and collective flows of information in line with the interests of a handful of actors. The diffusion of software services affects the personal, in the form of intensified identity shaping and self-management. It also affects the public, as more and more libraries, universities and public infrastructures as well as the management of public life rely on \"solutions\" provided by private companies. Centralizing data flows in the clouds, services blur the last traces of the thin line that separates bio- from necro-politics.\n\nGiven how fast these changes resonate and reproduce, there is a growing urgency to engage in a critique of software that goes beyond taking a distance, and that deals with the fact that we are inevitably already entangled. How can we interact, intervene, respond and think with software? What approaches can allow us to recognize the agency of different actors, their ways of functioning and their politics? What methods of observation enable critical inquiry and affirmative discord? What techniques can we apply to resurface software where it has melted into the infrastructure and into the everyday? How can we remember that software is always at work, especially where it is designed to disappear into the background?\n\nWe pick up the word \"observation\", turning it over and around. We bring it right up to our noses and hold it outstretched to get a better look, holding all of the histories of people looking at other people in mind, holding terminals and keyboards in hand. We regard observation as a way to approach software, as one way to organize engagement with its implications. Observation, and the enabling of it through intensive data-centric feedback mechanisms, is part of  the cybernetic principles that underpin present day software production. Our aim was to scrutinize this methodology in its many manifestations, including in \"observatories\" -- high cost infrastructures of observation troubled by colonial, imperial, empirical traditions and their problematic divisions of nature and culture. And through scrutiny, we hope to open up a set of questions about who gets to observe software (and how) and who is being observed by software (and with what impact)? It is a question of power, one that we answer, at least in part, with critical play. But also with slow pedagogy.\n\nor:\n\nWe picked up the word \"observation\", turning it over and around.

But also with slow pedagogy.\n\nWe are techno-galactic as we meet the contemporary paradigms of computation that proudly announce their capability for \"scaling up to the universe.\" We stand here as modest witnesses to the scales of software communities and related political economies that involve and require observation.\n\nThis guide offers a set of practical and fantastical tools for the tactical (mis)use of software, empowering/enabling users to resist embedded paradigms and assumptions. It is a collection of methods for approaching software, experiencing its myths and realities, its risks and benefits. Drawing on theories of software and computation developed in academia and elsewhere, we grounded our methods in hands-on exercises and experiments that you now can try at home. This Guide to Techno-Galactic Software Observation offers methods developed in and inspired by the context of software production, hacker culture, software studies, computer science research, Free Software communities, privacy activism, and artistic practice. It invites you to experiment with ways to stay with the trouble of software. Come join us at the edge of the universe, on the metro platform, at your kitchen table, as we mark and measure critical distances from and entanglements with the seemingly endless software systems that surround us.\n\nThe techno-galactic software survival guide was collectively produced as an outcome of the Techno-Galactic Software Observatory. \n[This feels like it could be in a different font size or in brackets or is the start of the next page/spread?]\n\n\nRemaining thoughts/notes for inspiration:\nYou may want to just throw all your devices away, but before you do so, wouldn't you want to, for once poke them back?\nYou may think about retreating to a natural reserve, and live a software free life, but even then, do you think you could manage without talking about your past software troubles.\nAnd, how about those drawings at the nearby cave, that look eerily similar to an ancient flowchart, you think you can just ignore its poetry?\n\n\n% http://observatory.constantvzw.org/images/friday/P1010328.JPG\n% SHOW: tgsoimages.svg tgsoteam N\n% INFO: Techno-Galactic Software Observation team, WTC Brussels, June 2017\n\n## The Techno-Galactic Software Observatory\n\nIn the summer of 2017, around thirty people gathered in Brussels to explore practices of proximate critique with and of software in the context of a worksession entitled \"Techno-Galactic Software Observatory\".[^]{Worksessions are intensive transdisciplinary moments, organised twice a year by Constant. They aim to provide conditions for participants with different experiences and capabilities to temporarily link their practice and to  develop ideas, prototypes and  research projects together. For the worksessions, primarily Free, Libre and Open Source software is used and material that is available under Open Content Licenses.} The worksession called for software-curious people of all kinds to ask questions about software. The intuition behind such a call was that different types of engagement requires a heterogeneous group of participants with different levels of expertise,  skill and background. During three sessions of two days, participants collectively inspected the space-time of computation and probed the universe of hardware-software separations through excursions, exercises and conversations. They tried out various perspectives and methods to look at the larger picture of software as a concept, as a practice, and as a set of techniques.\n\nThe first two days of The Techno-Galactic Software Observatory included visits to the Musée de l'Informatique Pionnière en Belgique [^]{http://www.nam-ip.be} in Namur and the Computermuseum KULeuven[^]{http://www.etwie.be/database/actor/computermuseum-ku-leuven}. In the surroundings of these collections of historical ’numerical artefacts’, we started viewing software in a long-term context. It was an occasion to reflect on the conditions of its appearance, and allowed us to take on current-day questions from a genealogical perspective. What is software? How did it appear as a concept, in what industrial and governmental circumstances? What happens to the material conditions of its production (minerals, factory labor, hardware) when it evaporates into a cloud?\n\nThe second two days we focused on the space-time dimension of IT development. The way computer programs and operating systems are manufactured changed tremendously through time, and so did its production times and places. From military labs via the mega-corporation cubicles to the open-space freelancer utopia, what ruptures and continuities can be traced in the production, deployment, maintenance and destruction of software? From time-sharing to user-space partitions and containerization, what separations were and are at work? Where and when is software made today?\n\n% SHOW: tgsoimages.svg tgsoview N\n\n\n% http://gallery.constantvzw.org/index.php/Techno-Galactic-Software-Observatory/IMAG1399\n% SHOW: tgsoimages.svg scppath\n% INFO: Documenting the path of a Software Curious Person going through the Walk-in Clinic\n\n## The Walk-in Clinic\n\nThe last two days at the Techno-galactic software observatory were dedicated to observation and its consequences. The development of software encompasses a series of practices whose evocative names are increasingly familiar: feedback, report, probe, audit, inspect, scan, diagnose, explore, test ... What are the systems of knowledge and power within which these activities take place, and what other types of observation are possible? As a practical set for our investigations, we set up a walk-in clinic on the 25th floor of the World Trade Center, where users and developers could arrive with software-questions of all kinds.\n\n> Do you suffer from the disappearance of your software into the cloud,\n> feel oppressed by unequal user privilege, or experience the torment of\n> software-ransom of any sort?\n> Bring your devices and interfaces to the World Trade Center!\n> With the help of a clear and in-depth session, at the Techno-Galactic\n> Walk-In Clinic we guarantee immediate results.\n> The  Walk-In Clinic provides free hands-on observations to software\n> curious  people of all kinds. A wide range of professional and amateur \n> practitioners will provide you with Software-as-a-Critique-as-a-Service\n> on the spot. Available services range from immediate interface critique, \n> collaborative code inspection, data dowsing, various forms of network\n> analyses, unusability testing, identification of unknown viruses,\n> risk assessment, opening of black-boxes and more.\n> Free software observations provided.\n> Last intake at 16:45.\n> [^]{Invitation to the Walk-In Clinic, June 2017}\n\n% On the following

once-again\n> that the emperor has no clothes, than in finding a way to _diffract_ critical inquiry\n> in order to make difference patterns in a more worldly way.\n> [@haraway:1996:witness]\n% p429, Haraway, modest witness, 1996 from: http://observatory.constantvzw.org/etherdump/friday.md.diff.html\n\n\nA spectre is haunting the galaxy. No matter where you happen to be, if you are looking at the worlds around you, there is software running somewhere in the background. Look! There it is, looking right back at you. Be it your phone screen or a passing satellite, software's observation feels complete. Or, is it? And, whether its gaze The techno-galactic software survival guide that you are reading right now turns this image of a totally observed world on its head, and sticks it into a self-reflecting elevator.\n\nWith the rise of online services, the use of software has increasingly been knitted into the production of software, even while the rhetoric, rights and procedures continue to suggest that use and production constitute separate realms. This knitting together and its corresponding disavowal has an effect on the way software is used and produced that radically alters its operative role in society. The shifts ripple across galaxies, through social structures, working conditions and personal relations, resulting in a profusion of apparatuses aspiring to be seamless while optimizing and monetizing individual and collective flows of information in line with the interests of a handful of actors. The diffusion of software services affects the personal, in the form of intensified identity shaping and self-management. It also affects the public, as more and more libraries, universities and public infrastructures as well as the management of public life rely on \"solutions\" provided by private companies. Centralizing data flows in the clouds, services blur the last traces of the thin line that separates bio- from necro-politics.\n\nGiven how fast these changes resonate and reproduce, there is a growing urgency to engage in a critique of software that goes beyond taking a distance, and that deals with the fact that we are inevitably already entangled. How can we interact, intervene, respond and think with software? What approaches can allow us to recognize the agency of different actors, their ways of functioning and their politics? What methods of observation enable critical inquiry and affirmative discord? What techniques can we apply to resurface software where it has melted into the infrastructure and into the everyday? How can we remember that software is always at work, especially where it is designed to disappear into the background?\n\nWe pick up the word \"observation\", turning it over and around. We bring it right up to our noses and hold it outstretched to get a better look, holding all of the histories of people looking at other people in mind, holding terminals and keyboards in hand. We regard observation as a way to approach software, as one way to organize engagement with its implications. Observation, and the enabling of it through intensive data-centric feedback mechanisms, is part of  the cybernetic principles that underpin present day software production. Our aim was to scrutinize this methodology in its many manifestations, including in \"observatories\" -- high cost infrastructures of observation troubled by colonial, imperial, empirical traditions and their problematic divisions of nature and culture. And through scrutiny, we hope to open up a set of questions about who gets to observe software (and how) and who is being observed by software (and with what impact)? It is a question of power, one that we answer, at least in part, with critical play. But also with slow pedagogy.\n\nor:\n\nTogether we picked up the word \"observation\", turning it over and around. We brought it right up to our noses and held it outstretched to get a better look, holding all of the histories of people looking at other people in mind, holding terminals and keyboards in hand. We regarded observation as a way to approach software, as one way to organize engagement with its implications. Observation, and the enabling of it through intensive data-centric feedback mechanisms, is part of  the cybernetic principles that underpin present day software production.\n\n\nWe are techno-galactic as we meet the contemporary paradigms of computation that proudly announce their capability for \"scaling up to the universe.\" We stand here as modest witnesses to the scales of software communities and related political economies that involve and require observation.\n\nThis guide offers a set of practical and fantastical tools for the tactical (mis)use of software, empowering/enabling users to resist embedded paradigms and assumptions. It is a collection of methods for approaching software, experiencing its myths and realities, its risks and benefits. Drawing on theories of software and computation developed in academia and elsewhere, we grounded our methods in hands-on exercises and experiments that you now can try at home. This Guide to Techno-Galactic Software Observation offers methods developed in and inspired by the context of software production, hacker culture, software studies, computer science research, Free Software communities, privacy activism, and artistic practice. It invites you to experiment with ways to stay with the trouble of software. Come join us at the edge of the universe, on the metro platform, at your kitchen table, as we mark and measure critical distances from and entanglements with the seemingly endless software systems that surround us.\n\nThe techno-galactic software survival guide was collectively produced as an outcome of the Techno-Galactic Software Observatory. \n[This feels like it could be in a different font size or in brackets or is the start of the next page/spread?]\n\n\nRemaining thoughts/notes for inspiration:\nYou may want to just throw all your devices away, but before you do so, wouldn't you want to, for once poke them back?\nYou may think about retreating to a natural reserve, and live a software free life, but even then, do you think you could manage without talking about your past software troubles.\nAnd, how about those drawings at the nearby cave, that look eerily similar to an ancient flowchart, you think you can just ignore its poetry?\n\n% http://observatory.constantvzw.org/images/friday/P1010328.JPG\n% SHOW: tgsoimages.svg tgsoteam N\n% INFO: Techno-Galactic Software Observation team, WTC Brussels, June 2017\n\n## The Techno-Galactic Software Observatory\n\nIn the summer of 2017, around thirty people gathered in Brussels to explore practices of proximate critique with and of software in the context of a worksession entitled \"Techno-Galactic Software Observatory\".[^]{Worksessions are intensive transdisciplinary moments, organised twice a year by Constant. They aim to provide conditions for participants with different experiences and capabilities to temporarily link their practice and to  develop ideas, prototypes and  research projects together. For the worksessions, primarily Free, Libre and Open Source software is used and material that is available under Open Content Licenses.} The worksession called for software-curious people of all kinds to ask questions about software. The intuition behind such a call was that different types of engagement requires a heterogeneous group of participants with different levels of expertise,  skill and background. During three sessions of two days, participants collectively inspected the space-time of computation and probed the universe of hardware-software separations through excursions, exercises and conversations. They tried out various perspectives and methods to look at the larger picture of software as a concept, as a practice, and as a set of techniques.\n\nThe first two days of The Techno-Galactic Software Observatory included visits to the Musée de l'Informatique Pionnière en Belgique [^]{http://www.nam-ip.be} in Namur and the Computermuseum KULeuven[^]{http://www.etwie.be/database/actor/computermuseum-ku-leuven}. In the surroundings of these collections of historical ’numerical artefacts’, we started viewing software in a long-term context. It was an occasion to reflect on the conditions of its appearance, and allowed us to take on current-day questions from a genealogical perspective. What is software? How did it appear as a concept, in what industrial and governmental circumstances? What happens to the material conditions of its production (minerals, factory labor, hardware) when it evaporates into a cloud?\n\nThe second two days we focused on the space-time dimension of IT development. The way computer programs and operating systems are manufactured changed tremendously through time, and so did its production times and places. From military labs via the mega-corporation cubicles to the open-space freelancer utopia, what ruptures and continuities can be traced in the production, deployment, maintenance and destruction of software? From time-sharing to user-space partitions and containerization, what separations were and are at work? Where and when is software made today?\n\n%!SHOW: tgsoimages.svg tgsoview N\n\n% Let's have one page with more images\n% http://gallery.constantvzw.org/index.php/Techno-Galactic-Software-Observatory/IMAG1399\n% SHOW: tgsoimages.svg scppath\n% INFO: Documenting the path of a Software Curious Person going through the Walk-in Clinic\n\n## The Walk-in Clinic\n\nThe last two days at the Techno-galactic software observatory were dedicated to observation and its consequences. The development of software encompasses a series of practices whose evocative names are increasingly familiar: feedback, report, probe, audit, inspect, scan, diagnose, explore, test ... What are the systems of knowledge and power within which these activities take place, and what other types of observation are possible? As a practical set for our investigations, we set up a walk-in clinic on the 25th floor of the World Trade Center, where users and developers could arrive with software-questions of all kinds.\n\n> Do you suffer from the disappearance of your software into the cloud,\n> feel oppressed by unequal user privilege, or experience the torment of\n> software-ransom of any sort?\n> Bring your devices and interfaces to the World Trade Center!\n> With the help of a clear and in-depth session, at the Techno-Galactic\n> Walk-In Clinic we guarantee immediate results.\n> The  Walk-In Clinic provides free hands-on observations to software\n> curious  people of all kinds.

Look! There it is, looking right back at you. Be it your phone screen or a passing satellite, software's observation and entanglement in the everyday appears complete. But is it so total? Let's look more closely. \n\n We find ourselves in a universe built on a 1990s revival of a 1960s dream: software as a service [@haigh:2001:soft60]. In this online universe, the use of software has increasingly been knitted into the production of software, even while the rhetoric, rights, and procedures around software continue to suggest that use and production constitute separate realms. This knitting together and its corresponding disavowal radically alters the operative role of software in society. The shifts ripple across galaxies, through social structures, working conditions, and personal relations, resulting in a profusion of apparatuses that aspire to be seamless while optimizing and monetizing individual and collective flows of information in line with the interests of a handful of actors. The diffusion of software services affects individuals and communities in the form of intensified identity shaping and self-management, and affects the public, as institutions and common use infrastructures increasingly rely on \"solutions\" provided by private companies for their management. As online services increasingly centralize data flows in the clouds, they blur the last traces of the thin line separating bio- from necro-politics.[@hu:2015:prehistory]\n\nAs software spins its web around us, we reflexively try to take some distance only to realize that we are too well tangled in its gooey net. Caught upside down and dangling we ask: How can we interact, respond to, and think with software? What approaches can we use to recognize the agency of different actors, their ways of working, and their politics? What methods of observation are conducive to critical inquiry and affirmative discord? How can we resurface software, to find sites where its infrastructures are reconfiguring the everyday? How can we take stock of the ways software is always at work, especially where it is designed to disappear into the background?\n\nBowled over by these questions, by constant pop-ups and push notifications, a fantasy takes shape of smashing our devices with a sledge hammer, throwing them in the river, retreating off grid and out of sight, and living software free lives. But this fantasy that cannot hold. It cannot hold us. Perhaps it is available to the tech-biilionaires building and stocking bunkers, but for most of the people on this planet, for the poorest, for the less and least powerful, for someone who is almost anyone having a sudden software tantrum, it is not going to do it. We are in search of a better fantasy. One that lets us poke and push back. \n\nThe Techno-Galactic Software Survival Guide (% CARLINSAYS: use agreed title) is an obsessive fantasy of optimization turned on its head, and stuck to the ceiling of a self-reflecting elevator. It is the ultimate book of dos and don'ts, of forgotten histories and un-inevitable futures, of mindful agile actions and improvisational service architectures, of any and all things that you can and cannot imagine needing in a techno-galaxy. We are techno-galactic in order to meet the contemporary paradigms of computation that proudly announce their capability for \"scaling up to the universe.\" We stand here as modest witnesses to the scales of software communities and related political economies that involve and require observation.\n\nAt the Techno-Galactic Software Observatory worksession we developed state of the art methods that we now offer to you. To do this, we picked up the word \"observation\", turning it over and around. We brought it right up to our noses and held it outstretched to get a better look, holding all of the histories of people looking at others and objects in mind, holding computers and keyboards in hand. Observation, and the enabling of it through intensive data-centric feedback mechanisms, is part of the cybernetic spells that underpin present day software production. In this present moment, we sync our breath to the rhythm of our software and propose holistic observation as one way to enter an engagement with software's implications. \n\nThis guide invites you to experiment with ways to stay with the trouble of software. In it you will find a set of practical and fantastical tools for the tactical (mis)use of software, empowering and enabling users to resist embedded paradigms and assumptions. It is a collection of methods for approaching software, experiencing its myths and realities, its risks and benefits. Drawing on theories of software and computation developed in academia and elsewhere, we grounded our methods in hands-on exercises and experiments that you now can try at home. These methods were developed in and inspired by the context of software production, hacker culture, software studies, computer science research, Free Software communities, privacy activism, and artistic practice. \n\nReading is not enough, software is not just a text, observation is one potential beginning, engagement is tickling. Can you call up that feeling of the approach of a touch that cannot be born with a straight face? Come join us at the edge of the universe, on the metro platform, at your kitchen table, as we mark and measure critical distances from and entanglements with the seemingly endless software systems that surround us.\n\n\nThe techno-galactic software survival guide (% CARLINSAYS: use agreed title) was collectively produced as an outcome of the Techno-Galactic Software Observatory. \n(% CARLINSAYS: This feels like it could be in a different font size or in brackets or is the start of the next page/spread?)\n\n\n(% CARLINSAYS: do we want to keep this quote for the intro? If so I think it should be up top with the Haraway)\nkostas axelos, planetary interlude, maybe some bits fit with the intro?:\n\n Whether he delves into analysis and disintegration -- since he needs\n analyses, concrete and tangible solutions and experimentations -- or\n whether he plunges into syntheses -- since the abstracting power and\n the ungraspable attract him equally --, as precisely and as far as he\n may cast his nets, what his nets catch and what passes through them\n communicate. Never quite awake and never quite beclouded, will we\n learn to live and to see beings and things simultaneously from close\n up and far away, large and small, in their and in our wandering\n (errance), in the great World which is at the same time small, where\n there are no victors - would there be vanquished?\n\n## The Techno-Galactic Software Observatory\n\nIn the summer of 2017, thirty or so people gathered in Brussels to explore practices of proximate critique with and of software in the context of a worksession entitled \"Techno-Galactic Software Observatory\".[^]{Worksessions are intensive transdisciplinary moments, organised twice a year by Constant. They aim to provide conditions for participants with different experiences and capabilities to temporarily link their practice and to  develop ideas, prototypes and  research projects together. For the worksessions, primarily Free, Libre and Open Source software is used and material that is available under Open Content Licenses.} The worksession called for software-curious people of all kinds to ask questions about software. The intuition behind such a call was that developing different types of engagement requires a heterogeneous group of participants with different levels of expertise,  skill and background. During three sessions that were two days each, participants collectively inspected the space-time of computation and probed the universe of hardware-software separations through excursions, exercises and conversations. They tried out various perspectives and methods to look at the larger picture of software as a concept, as a practice, and as a set of techniques.\n\nThe first two days of The Techno-Galactic Software Observatory included visits to the Musée de l'Informatique Pionnière en Belgique [^]{http://www.nam-ip.be} in Namur and the Computermuseum KULeuven[^]{http://etwie.be/database/actor/computermuseum-ku-leuven}. Surrounded by these collections of historical ’numerical artefacts’, we started considering software in a long-term context (% CARLINSAYS: Do we mean a long historical context or longue duree or something else?). The museum visits provided an occasion to reflect on the conditions of software's appearance (% CARLINSAYS: appearances?) and to take on current-day questions from a genealogical perspective. What is software? How did it appear as a concept, in what industrial and governmental circumstances? What happens to the material conditions of its production (minerals, factory labor, hardware) when it evaporates into a cloud?\n\nThe second two days were spent focusing on the space-time dimension of IT development. The way computer programs and operating systems are manufactured has changed tremendously over the last seventy years, as has its production times and places. From military labs to the mega-corporation cubicles to the open-space freelancer utopia, what ruptures and continuities can be traced in the production, deployment, maintenance and destruction of software? From time-sharing to user-space partitions and containerization, what separations were and are at work? Where and when is software made today?\n\nThe last two days at the Techno-Galactic Software Observatory were dedicated to observation and its consequences. The development of software encompasses a series of practices whose evocative names are increasingly familiar: feedback, report, probe, audit, inspect, scan, diagnose, explore, test. What are the systems of knowledge and power within which these activities take place, and what other types of observation are possible? As a practical set for our investigations, we set up a walk-in clinic on the 25th floor of the World Trade Center, where users and developers could arrive with software-questions of all kinds.\n\n## The Walk-in Clinic (% CARLINSAYS: I think this title should go below the description of the walk-in clinic as the last two days of the observatory worksession and should come instead right above the invitation to the clinic so I have moved it there)\n\n> Do you suffer from the disappearance of your software into the cloud,\n> feel oppressed by unequal user privilege, or experience the torment of\n> software-ransom of any sort?\n> Bring your devices and interfaces to the World Trade Center!\n> With the help of a clear and in-depth session, at the Techno-Galactic\n> Walk-In Clinic we guarantee immediate results.\n> The  Walk-In Clinic provides free hands-on observations to software\n> curious  people of all kinds.

It also seems important to make sure that the two page list of services poster for the clinic is printed on pages that are facing each other. If they are already set to do that then maybe nix my suggestion of moving the intake form up, but if they are not then that would be one way to shift the pages to make that happen.)\n\n\n","attribs":"*0+n+1*7+3*0|2+2*7+2+2*6+1+8*6+1+6*6+1+8*6+1+8*6+1+a*6+3*7+1*6+5o|2+2+1q*0|1+1+1s*0|1+1+1p*0|1+1+18*6|1+1|1+q*b|1+1*6+1r*0+1*e+b*6+1f*0+1*e+n*6+7*e+1*6+1g*e+1*6+3q*e+a*6+z*e+m*6+1s*e|2+2*6+2p*e+l*6+q*e+37*6+1*e+f*6+g*e+41*6+3*e+g*6+c*e+2k*6+1*e+1t*6+c*e+58*6+r*e+1s*6+h*e+c*6+d*e+4*6+b*e+26*6+8*e+2*6+b*e+2*6+x*e+8*6+2*e+q*6+4*e+t*6+5*e+6*6+9*e+q*6+l*e|2+2*6+2*e+z*6+w*e+9*6+8*e+d*6+u*e+a*6+15*e+1*6|2+do*6+2d*e+c*6+5w*e+z*6+u*e+2*6+1b*e+b*6+12*e+1*6+10*e+2*6+g*e+7*6+1*e+1*6+2*e+n*6|8+1si*6+8t*6*d+q*6+2d*9|1+1*6|3+4l*6*j+3g*6|2+2*f|1+1*6|1+34*f|2+22*f+1g*0+1*f|1+h*f+1s*0+1*f|1+5*f+z*0+1*f|1+y*f+11*0+1*f|7+bt|1+1+17*0|1+1|1+1+t*6+6+4s*0+1+1*0+1+1*0+b3*9+m*0+1+3w*6+b+11*6+1+3c*6+9+9*6+5|2+8y+3p*0+1+1*0+m+15*0+1o+2*6+d+1v*6+b+w*6+2g+2*6+h+1*6+8*9+3+16*6+a+b*6+x|2+88+m*6+h+35*6+4+l*6+4+2*6+l+3*6+5+1h*6+2|2+95+w*6+1+8*6+1+8*6+1+6s*6+2|1+95*6|2+72|1+1*0+2*1+1x*0|1+1*0+2*1+1y*0|1+1*0+2*1+s*0|1+1*0+2*1+1o*0|1+1*0+2*1+1x*0|1+1*0+2*1+1a|1+1*0+2*1+1v*0|1+1*0+2*1+1z*0|1+1*0+2*1+1z*0|1+1*0+2*1+21*0|1+1*0+2*1+1x*0|1+1*0+2*1+1t*0|1+1*0*1+2*1+1d*0|1+1*0+2*1+10*0|1+1*0+2*1+l|1+1*0+7+16*0+1|2+2*0+2+n*0|1+1*0+2+1j*7|1+1*0+2|1+1f*7|5+6h*7+1r*0|1+1*7|2+46*0|1+1*6+cs*a|1+1*6|1+1|1+1"},"pool":{"numToAttrib":{"0":["author","a.PRabeGfk5jCXUq8V"],"1":["italic","true"],"2":["author",""],"3":["bold","true"],"4":["italic",""],"5":["bold",""],"6":["author","a.EXnmpSWanmHBGv1u"],"7":["author","a.eJQfyC3773rYpTah"],"8":["removed","true"],"9":["author","a.I4FbrrCTDQNN8GIf"],"10":["author","a.CLJqMQchPGX2f376"],"11":["author","a.E9CeYtsotzL7KxHP"],"12":["strikethrough","true"],"13":["underline","true"],"14":["author","a.UNWRO0eoIgQHRlJ9"],"15":["author","a.bAZlIfmFHdWvL5Sy"],"16":["author","a.ZCi8LR2sa05Au6me"],"17":["color","yellow"],"18":["author","a.kqv62Q3nhchdwIuK"],"19":["color","black"],"20":["strikethrough",""],"21":["color",""],"22":["sup","true"],"23":["color","orange"]},"nextNum":24},"head":6243,"chatHead":9,"publicStatus":false,"passwordHash":null,"savedRevisions":[{"revNum":1091,"savedById":"a.UNWRO0eoIgQHRlJ9","label":"Revision 1091","timestamp":1518166511450,"id":"370cf0a774acd742a161"},{"revNum":1571,"savedById":"a.UNWRO0eoIgQHRlJ9","label":"Revision 1571","timestamp":1518195101705,"id":"245ca5ddd4970287d44b"}]}}
