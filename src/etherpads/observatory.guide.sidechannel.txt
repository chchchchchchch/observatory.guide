% METHOD: Side Channel Analysis


% WHAT: A side channel attack is conducted by taking advantage of "leakage from boundaries". They are made possible by disregarding the abstraction of software into pure logic and focusing on the physical effects of the running of software which become backdoors to observe its functioning, hence re-affirming the materiality of software.

% HOW: As software runs on hardware, it emanates radio-magnetic waves, and you can, for example, build an antenna to capture these waves and then by analyzing them, reconstruct what the software is doing.
% WHEN:
% REMEMBER: "Hardware lives in the real world and real world properties lead to side channels."          
% WHO: bad guys/good guys
% URGENCY: 
% NOTE:
% WARNING: **engineers are good guys!**
