% METHOD: Side Channel Analysis


% WHAT: A side channel attack is conducted by taking advantage of "leakage from boundaries".
% HOW: As software runs on hardware it emanates radio-magnetic waves. You can build an antenna and use it to capture these waves and reconstruct what the software is doing.(% CARLINSAYS:This seems like an example not like a general HOW)
% WHEN:
% REMEMBER: "Hardware lives in the real world and real world properties lead to side channels."          
% WHO: bad guys/good guys
% URGENCY:  Side Channel attacks are possible by disregarding the abstraction of software into pure logic: the physical effects of the running of software become backdoors to observe its functioning, hence re-affirming the materiality of software. (% CARLINSAYS: this seems like the What or the How)

% NOTE:
% WARNING: **engineers are good guys!**
