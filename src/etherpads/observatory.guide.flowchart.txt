% METHOD: Flowcharts (Flow of the chart –> chart of the flow: on demand!) 

% WHAT:  - 

A flowchart is a type of diagram that represents an algorithm, workflow, or process by showing the steps as boxes of various kinds and depicting their order by connecting the boxes with arrows. This diagrammatic representation illustrates a solution model to a given problem. Flowcharts are used in analyzing, designing, documenting, or managing a process or program in various fields.[^]{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flowchart}

% WHY: Through flowcharts one will be able to analyze and reflect on one's own software situation.
% URGENCY: Using flowchart observation methods towards analysis will result in on-demand revelation of flows, relations, and connections previously obscured.
% NOTE: The term _software situation_ is suggested as a good replacement for _software problem_.

% ----------------

    1. Validate your situation? 
    2. Is it human or machine situation?
    human             machine                  I don't know
                |                   |                          |
    3. Choose a flowchart element that best describes your situation?
         ▭                ♢                          ⏢
    
    Operation  →  Represented as trapez     ⏢    
    Process    →  Represented as rectangle  ▭    
    Decision   →  Represented as rhombus    ♢    
    https://unicode-table.com/en/
    
    According to your answer go to question 4.
    
     4.1 Identify operation(s) that could
         help you out through the situation?
     4.2 Identify process(es)  that could
         help you out through the situation?
     4.3 Identify decision(s)  that could
         help you out through the situation?
    
    5. Was that actually helpful?
             Yes                                      No 
              |                                       |
            Done                        o. How does that make you feel?

## Appendix B

### Friday:

**15:30 - 16:15**    
We started our undertaking by analysing the rulers by IBM and Burroughs. It seems that every symbol on the two rulers has a specific shape and has a specific meaning. There are similarities between the shapes on the two rulers. On the Burroughs we found some symbols without descriptions. We tried to figure out their meaning. We counted up the symbols on the IBM and Burroughs rulers. The specific literature explained to us that engineers have a kind of standard for these symbols. These symbols are vocabulary.

**16:15 - 16:40**    
We started with analyzing an [educational flow chart as our case example](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flowchart#/media/File:LampFlowchart.svg): We were able to figure out what the arrows on the ruler meant. They are used in combination with the decision symbol. In shape studies, triangles can be used to direct movement based on the direction they point. In the flowchart, the options are represented by rectangles and squares. In shape studies rectangles and squares are stable. They’re familiar and trusted shapes and suggest honesty. 

**16:45 - 17:00**    
We analyzed a flow chart of a multiplication algorithm. Its content illustrated an instruction to shift the number left or right . The decision box instructed you to repeat it 32 times for the whole number! 
The rectangles were again representing options, while the flexible factors were illustrated by the rhombus, the symbol for Decision. The final symbol with the title "Done" was illustrated by something inbetween a circle and a rectangle. 

**17:00 - 17:15**    
We realized in our undertaking that we needed to jump into an internal perspective and get more familiar with the task of flow chart drawing. For this flow chart we decided to chart the elevator to the first floor from the perspective of the elevator. To achieve this task we agreed to do field research and go to the first floor by elevator for real. Some of us used this opportunity to smoke a cigarette and to elaborate on the experience of the elevator. The final goal is the create a flow chart based on our observations, but we are going to do this tomorrow. [^]{Further elevator ruminations were made through reference to Marc Isaacs. Lift. UK, 2001. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FJNAvyLCTik}

**17:15 - 17:40**    
To round off the day we ended with some general reflections. It seems that the different interpretations of symbols have been integrated into flowcharts from the early ones of the 1920s until now.[@xing:flowcharts] To put this knowledge into practice we started to sketch out the flowchart on the wall using Post-its.

**Current research goals:**

* Flowchart or intervention: what is it like to be a elevator
* Zenit browser extension
* Iconographic analyses of flow chart symbols
* Call-flow && zenit modeling template for the drop-in clinic interview

### Saturday:

**11:00 - 11:40**    
We updated our research followers and fellow researchers about our undertakings.

**14:45-18:00**    
Zenit(h) modeling/analysis    
A method derived from a removal of textual informating from flowcharts -- related to previous work with [Zenit: International Review of Arts and Culture](https://monoskop.org/Zenit) created by Ljubomir Micic, founder of Zenitism (Zenitizam) an early 20th Century movement, and zenith -- an imaginary point directly "above" a particular location, on [the imaginary celestial sphere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zenith)

## How to create browser add on /or browser extension:

1. Make a new dir at your local machine. Lets called it adds-on & and a folder called icons
2. Make an icon for your browser extension
3. Open text editor and copy paste this jason code 
4. You will need to modify the last two lines to point to the etherbox.local & css to point to the extension.css
5. Make an css script place your css there 

On the browser:

1. Go to extension      
2. Load debugger from `about:debugging`
3. Load your extension
