% METHOD: Glossaries as an exercise

% REMEMBER: 
% WHAT: Using the technique of psychoanalytic listening to compile (gather, collect, bring together) a list of keywords for understanding software.
% HOW: Create a shared document that participants can add words to as their importance emerges. To do pyschoanalytic listening, let your attention float freely, hovering evenly, over a conversation or a text until something catches its ear. Write down what your ear/eye catches. When working in a collective context invite others to participate in this project and describe the practice to them. Each individual may move in and out of this mode of listening according to their interest and desire and may add as many words to the list as they want. Use this list to create an index of software observation.
% WHEN:
% WHO:
% URGENCY: Not creating and troubling categories on a regular basis risks path determinacy.

% NOTE: Do not remove someone else's word from the glossary during the accumulation phase. During the editing phase (which comes after the conclusion of the accumulation phase and is ideally conducted through collective consensus), you can mark them for attention. If possible, keep traces of those terms nominated for removal or merging.

% NOTE: There was no consensus regarding the preceding note.

% WARNING: This method is not exclusive to and was not developed for software observation. It may lead to awareness of unconscious processes and to shifts in structures of feeling and relation.
