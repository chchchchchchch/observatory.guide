% WHAT: Observe and catalog the common gestures, common comportments, and common sense(s) surrounding software.

% NOTE: The common senses and comportments of software are informed and conditioned by those of hardware and so perhaps this is more accurately a method for articulating comportments of computing. 
% WARNING: Software wears on both individual and collective bodies and selves. Software may harm your physical and emotional health and that of your society both by design and by accident.
% HOW: - 
This can be done through observation of yourself or others. Separate the apprehended and matter of fact from the meanings, actions, reactions, judgements, and assessments that the apprehension occasions. 
1. Begin by assembling a list of questions such as: When you see a software application icon what are you most likely to do? When a software application you are using presents you with a user agreement what are you most likely to do? When a software applciation does something that frustrates you what are you most likely to do? When a software application you are using crashes what are you most likely to do?
2. Write down your responses and the responses of any subjects you are observing.
3. For each question, think up three other possible responses. Write these down. 
4. (This step is only for the very curious) Try these other possible responses out the next time you encounter each of the given scenarios.
