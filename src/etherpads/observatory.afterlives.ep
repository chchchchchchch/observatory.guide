Experienced it through resurrecting the pi/etherbox -- CSI !\nInteresting to see what had happened, the dirty db issue. There are notes? [where?] That situation (during - after)\nit would be good to incoporate things like Jogi's (Yogi?\") 's post event report (email)\nmm: Micro-moments of detour, hyper-focused moments. Sense of single shared effort with the transformation to service on monday..\n\nPP: different tasks, ideas for new projects ... so many new ideas, tasks. Linked to code, machines but also the socio(logical) issues. Super intense. Ways of looking at software over the days. Switching from observation to service interesting.\nI should do this.... I  should do this.... I should do this.... (thinking \"Shouldn't you be working now\" .... cf Silvio's presentation)\nThe intensity of it: quite a Concentrated look at software over a few days ... \nPP ideology of well-being for web-development ... Tim Ferris ... Future of work. MM remembers: getting things done. Infusing in web culture.\nTim Ferriss: 4 hour week? https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Ferriss  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_4-Hour_Workweek\nStephen CoveyThe 7 Habits of Highly Effective People\nTom Rath  How Full Is Your Bucket? Positive Strategies for Work and Life & Eat Move Sleep: How Small Choices Lead to Big Changes\nPeggy would like to write something about it... (en francais??) ... many english sources \n\nAn Goldenberg? coming for Transmarcations... Hacking with Care.\nhttps://hackingwithcare.in/\n\nFrom Namur: most of all images (there are recordings -- FR better than EN). Leuven: recordings. Afterlife interview ?\nHardware as a limit to abstraction. Reworked in dirty db experience and also as a service.\n\nThe walk-in clinic as a collective performance. Could, should it be redone? Energy, intensity mainly from improvisation, together translating experience in service. \nit was not 5 day research towards the public moment, rather the public moment was a day of research to add to the previous days..\nperformance of 'service' is what makes it accessible. We could take that light at the clinic -- but if we would be doing it again, what would that mean?\nIntake super important.\n\nGuide: what does it promise to guide you through? The survival guide was interesting ... ideas of orienting, some parts were really about survival? Taking the survival litterally? (also the clinic services were super mixed). \nFrom what you think is interesting, to making it interesting for others?\n\nFeedback from participants ... what has changed/shifted in working with software might have happened?\n\n-- we decide to collectively go through the files and traces. Many things we forgot about! Also finding back some notes on observation, what the guide could be, and how to structure it. \nhttp://pad.constantvzw.org/p/observatory.inventory\n\nSome things for a second round:\n*Peggy: interested in doing an interview with Jean Huens, or make sure this gets reworked/made into a good document.\n*Anita: Find concrete ideas of ways/traces of how the conceptual structure of TGSO worked out, developed during the session. Fpr example: recover from the scattered notes the use of forensic tools.\n*Martino: ref. http://diversions.constantvzw.org/ but in this case, make different versions/readings of the material. Guided tours!\n*Femke: Would like to see/work on a \"repackaging\" of the Walk-in clinic, document the services + files etc.\n*In a text, a recorded/annotated discussion ... to discuss how we went from the call to what we are able to think now? Try to read back the week through the question we asked, and to see what happened, what steps we took. How did the blocks help? How did the group itself framed it? Different layers of discourse.\n\nAfter Monday: write to the list to see who wants to help/join?\n\nMeeting I Round 2\n\nCarlin: What do you remember? Conversations about power, political economies, colonial histories. \nNotes from clinic -- collective performance. What would it mean? What would be constant, what iterative. Intake? Outtake? Should all the stations be repeated? Can it travel?\n\nThe cargo cult discussion which disappeared from the clinic\nIt wasn't there yet in Namur -- started in Leuven? All the terminology of Agile is in the clinic but the explicit reference to the political economies disappeared. A lot of humour (one way of critique) but maybe other things disappeared. If we think about a publication etc. etc. it is something to think about.\n\n\ndiscussing the issues with the dump -- a way to make the archive flow into the future ...\n\nMartino: Could the guide give different readings/guide through the dump?\nCan the \"feed system\" be a way ... (sth that is being developed for constant website). \nA list of materials and a list of links. What systems could there be that allow for a list of materials and list of links as a kind of navigation that would allow multiple paths and multiple narratives\nHow to make use of the fact that the post-processing is done by multiple people. The collective care-taking can be a way to keep things a bit more multi-narrative, heterogeneous.\nfeeling of obligation towards all traces.but\nobservation/critique/engagement relation\n\nTime capsule for group. \n\nReader\n(Guide as?) Documentation\nReflection\nNext - Publication\n\n\nReader as a pre-event\n\"dump\" as a doc of the event -- make something that is accessible to the group that participate\n+ reflection -- write, make. It is another audience.\n\nWho are the different audiences for this material?\nnot everything needs to be digestible to everyone\n\nthemes -- for another audience?\nby going back you start to see what was there and not\nlooking through dump for evidence of what we wanted to say\n\nExample: for relearn 2015 there was a trick to make an index together. The conversation of making the index is there too.\nhttp://relearn.be/2015/etherdump/appendindex.html\n\nA list of terms ... play .. concrete + common\n\nPeggy wanted to develop some material, getting some new material in. Infinite! Galactic!\n\nFraming texts should be not too hard now. \n\nSeda: audiences -- \n\ndocumentation vs. publication\nsomething that people who participated to can point to: appendindex is more a documentation, but not really a publication\n*documentation: communicates that something happened and that there is an urgency to the material\n*\nreperformance!??!\n*- people asked Femke, Donatella, Constants to do a reperformance/at a yearly festival.\n*- that would push production issues to the fore, not something that many of us feel excited about\n*\nquestions could be:\nWhat happened?\nWhat is here?\nWhat is missing?\nWhat was missing?\n\nPerformance -- ref. Public School, para-educational. Multi-subject. Platform. An instruction manual.\nhttps://publicschoolnyc.com and/or http://thepublicschool.org/\n\nwhat people found interesting, is the format. So maybe not so much about the material itself?\n\nDiscussion: where did we start, and what happened?\nWe are going to ask what it means to observe software? A critique of software studies. Is this the lens to look through the six days?\n\nRef. toolclinic: to look together/to observe software. http://www.vj13.constantvzw.org/site/transmission/extended see: \"EU in the making, an insider’s view through Parltrack and Pippilongstrings.\"\n\nMartino: What changes when you transform the research you are doing into something performative or something that is a service? It is in the tensions between the two modes (research and presentation/providing)\n\nWhat is performance? 99% uptime, agile yoga and runtime\nMaking public through your presence\nRun-time as a performance .. self-conscious presentation.
