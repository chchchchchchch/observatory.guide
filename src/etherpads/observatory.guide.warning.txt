**WARNING**

The survival techniques described in the following guide are to be used at your own risk in cases of emergency as well as in cases of nonurgent software curiosities.

> our methods for observation,    
> like mapping, come with their luggage.

The publisher will not accept any responsibility in case of damages caused by misuse, misunderstanding of instruction, or lack of curiosity. 
By trying the methods described in the guide, you accept responsibility for losing or loosing data and for altering hardware, including hard disks, usb key, cloud storage, and screens perhaps by throwing them on the floor, or by falling on the floor yourself upon tangling your feet in an entanglement of cables such that your laptop goes flying.

No harm has been done to humans, animals, computers or plants while creating the guide. No firearms or other kinds of weapons are needed in order to survive software. Just a little bit of patience.

**Physical fitness plays a great part of software observation. Be fit or CTRL-Quit.**

Remember, software observation can be stressful. You might experience:

Anxiety    
Sleep deprivation    
Forgetting about eating    
Loss of time tracking    

**Can you cope with software? You just have to.**
