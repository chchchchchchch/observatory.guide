### Notes on Layout:

% The typesetting of this guide is part of an ongoing exploration of document engineering
% from within and without interfaces of digital edit modes. While moving along ideas of lightweight
% markup and infinite rubber lengths, transplanting paradigms, and experiencing limitations and possibilities
% there is no end in sight. To put it in the spirit of illiterate programming:
% _When was the last time you spent a pleasant evening in a comfortable chair,
% cuddling with a multi-headed monster._[@bentley:1986:literate]
