## Notes on Layout:

Typesetting this guide is part of an ongoing exploration of document engineering
from within and without interfaces of digital edit modes. Moving along ideas of lightweight
markup and infinite rubber lengths, transplanting paradigms, experiencing limitations and possibilities
no end is in sight. To put it in the spirit of illiterate programming:
_When was the last time you spent a pleasant evening in a comfortable chair,
cuddling with a multi-headed monster._[@bentley:1986:literate]
