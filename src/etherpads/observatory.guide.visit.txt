% METHOD: Encounter several historical collections of hardware back-to-back

% CARLINSAYS: Do we want to capitalize all of words naming the Method to make it look like a title?

% REMEMBER:
% WHAT:
% HOW: This can be done by identifying one or more computer museums and visiting them with little time in-between. Visiting a friend with a large basement and lots of left-over computer equipment can have a similar effect. Seeing and possibly touching hardware from different contexts (state-administration, business, research, ...), periods of time, cultural contexts (California, Germany, French-speaking Belgium) and price ranges allows you to sense the interactions between hardware and software development.

% WHEN:
% WHO:
% URGENCY:
% NOTE: This method offers a perfect opportunity to hear people speak about objects in their contexts, how they worked and did not work and how particular pieces of hardware and software are linked one with another.  It also shows the economic and cultural aspects of softwares.

% WARNING: **DO NOT FOLD, SPINDLE OR MUTILATE**

% EXAMPLE: Spaghetti Suitcase

At one point during the demonstration of a Bull computer at Computer Museum NAM-IP, our museum guide (% CARLINSAYS: Just in the context of this publication as a guide maybe we should use docent or at least qualify it with the descriptor museum?) revealed the system's "software" -- a suitcase sized module with dozens of patch cords. She made the comment that the term "spaghetti code" (a derogatory expression for early code that used many "GOTO" statments) had its origin in this physical arrangement of code as patchings.

Preserving old hardware is a means of observing the physical manifestation of software. Operating older computers can result in actually touching software.

% EXAMPLE: Play with binary. Create punch cards.

"The highlight of the collection is to revive a real punch card workshop of the 1960s." (% CARLINSAYS: I don't want to change this because it is a quote but the right way to say it would be "is a recreation of a real punch card workshop"...it is not grammatically correct right now and also does not totally make sense in English at least)

% EXAMPLE: Collection de la Maison des Écritures d'Informatique & Bible, Maredsous  

The particularity of this collection lies in the fact that it conserves and presents multiple stages of the life of a software from its initial computerization through today. (% CARLINSAYS: Is there a way to name the Bible in this first sentence?)
The idea of introducing informatics as a method for working with/on the Bible (versions in Hebrew, Greek, Latin, and French) dates back to 1971, via punch card recordings and their memorization on magnetic tape. Then came the step of analyzing texts using computers.

% sign for the Computer Museum and should be kept separate from the images that illustrate the Bible software example)
