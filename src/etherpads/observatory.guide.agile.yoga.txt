% METHOD: Agile Sun Salutation
% REMEMBER: - 
> Agile software development describes a set of values and principles for software
> development under which requirements and solutions evolve through the collaborative
> effort of self-organizing cross-functional teams. It advocates adaptive planning,
> evolutionary development, early  delivery, and continuous improvement, and it encourages
> rapid and flexible response to change. These principles support the definition and
> continuing evolution of many software development methods.
> [@wikipedia:2018:agilesoftwaredevelopment]

% WHAT: You will be observing yourself
% HOW: - 
> Scrum is a framework for managing software development.
> It is designed for teams of three to nine developers who
> break their work into actions that can be completed within
> fixed duration cycles  (called "sprints"), track progress
> and re-plan in daily 15-minute stand-up meetings, and collaborate
> to deliver workable software every sprint. Approaches to coordinating
> the work of multiple scrum teams in larger organizations include
> Large-Scale Scrum, Scaled Agile Framework (SAFe) and Scrum of Scrums,
> among others.
> [@wikipedia:2018:scrum]

% WHEN: Anywhere where it's possible to lie on the floor 
% WHO: - 
> Self-organization and motivation are important, as are interactions
> like co-location and pair programming. It is better to have a good
> team of developers who communicate and  collaborate well, rather than
> a team of experts each operating in isolation. Communication is a
> fundamental concept.
> [@wikipedia:2018:agilemanifesto]

% URGENCY: Use Agile software development methods to develop a new path into your professional and personal life towards creativity, focus and health. (% CARLINSAYS: Was it ok to go from "Using" to "Use"? If the imperative is not quite right then we could substitute "encourages" in place of "towards" to make it a complete sentence.)
% NOTE:
% WARNING: - 
> The agile movement is in some ways a bit like a teenager: very self-conscious,
> checking constantly its appearance in a mirror,  accepting few criticisms,
> only interested in being with its peers, rejecting en bloc all wisdom from the
> past, just because it is from the  past, adopting fads and new jargon,
> at times cocky and arrogant. But I have no doubts that it will mature further,
> become more open to the outside world, more reflective, and also therefore more effective.
> [@kruchten:2011:as]
