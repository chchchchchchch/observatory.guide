> Infrastructure-as-a-service (IaaS) cloud-computing services
> provide virtualized system resources to end users, supporting
> each tenant in a separate virtual machine (VM). Fundamental to
> the economy of clouds is high resource utilization achieved by
> sharing: providers co-host multiple VMs on a single hardware 
> platform, relying on the underlying virtual-machine monitor (VMM)
> to isolate VMs and schedule system resources.
> While virtualization creates the illusion of strict isolation and
> exclusive resource access, in reality the virtual resources map to
> shared physical resources, creating the potential of interference
> between co-hosted VMs. A malicious VM may learn information on data
> processed by a victim VM and even conduct side-channel attacks on
> cryptographic implementations.

> Unlike proprietary software, SaaSS does not require covert code to
