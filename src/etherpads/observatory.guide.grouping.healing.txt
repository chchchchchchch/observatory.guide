> The programmer, who needs clarity, who must talk all day to a machine
> that demands declarations, hunkers down into a low-grade annoyance.
> It is here that the stereotype of the programmer, sitting in a dim room,
> growling from behind Coke cans, has its origins. The dis-order of the desk,
> the floor; the yellow Post-it notes everywhere; the whiteboards covered with
> scrawl: all this is the outward manifestation of the messiness of human thought.
> The messiness cannot go into the program; it piles up around the programmer.
> Soon the programmer has no choice but to retreat into some private interior space,
> closer to the machine, where things can be accomplished.
