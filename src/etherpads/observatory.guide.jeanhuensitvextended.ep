There were still operators at the main computer of the university, but there were also small computers, so researchers and student can have direct access when needed. \n\n**When did you start to work with software sold by others or gived away in order to do your research?** \n\nYou stil need an operating system on the mainframe that was delivered by IBM or the constructor delivering the mainframe. When you bought mini-computers, which were the  smaller versions of mainframes, in most cases you did buy an operating systems, compilers and all the stuff you need to be able to program those things. In most cases, because the computer sciences department did buy the mini-computer from, for instance *digital equipment corporation*,  a manufactorer of that time, but they didn't buy their software. They were not open source or free,  but you could get Unix and could run it on those digital equipment (DEC) computers. That is what the computer department of the University of Louvain la Neuve *l'unité d'informatique*, did and so did we.\n\n**When did you start working with unix as an os?** \n\nI took a trip to Amsterdam, it must have been in 1979/80… Well, the story starts in our french sister university (LLN) where they did have a PDP-11 with Unix on it https://hackadaycom.files.wordpress.com/2016/08/full-size-pdp11.jpg. You got Unix, at the time, when you were a university, from Bell Aps (Ma Bell), the american telephone company. It was a mega organisation at the time [before the [dismantlment of AT&T/Bell system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breakup_of_the_Bell_System)].Due to monopoly, the US authorities splitted up in different Baby Bells. One of the restriction was there was a research baby bell, they couldn't really sell anything.There were computer scientists there, who did developped some Unix interesting things.  For universities you did get the source and no support for free. How to install it, no idea. In Unité d'informatique, they were lucky: they got the same computer that unix were developped on.  They got the disk by snail mail as a post-office package. They mounted it and it did spin up and they had it.\nHere, we did have a cheaper PDP11 (DEC - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PDP-11) We go the disk source from Bell Aps but we could not run it. We could look at it but that was all, because our disc format was different than the one at Bell Aps. Somebody here did write a driver for that disk and we did compiled it in l'unité d'informatique of LLN.  it did compile it but we couldn't try it because we did not have So we find the nearest Unix system compatiblewith ours, it was in Amsterdam.  Andrew Tenebaum who did write since then a number of books about operating systems and became quite an authority. He was working there. It was the young Tanenbaum, just arriving from United States to Amsterdam. He was learning to speak dutch. We did understood his english better but his assistant insisted that he speaks dutch because he will have to pass an exam in dutch. There we got a disk, than also the one we com than we got here and we start using Unix.\n\n\n\n\n\n","attribs":"|1+g*6|2+2*5+3p*6|1+1*5+4f*6|2+2+dm*6|2+2+4n*6|1+1|1+1*5+11*6|2+2+bc*6|2+2+5z*2+3e*3+1*4*3+20*4+1*6|2+2+e7*6|2+2+7n*6|2+2*5+1a*6|2+2+53*6|2+2*5+19*6|2+2+c7*6|2+2*5+1r*6|2+2+jo*6|1+1+41*6|2+2*5+1a*6|2+2+5g*6|2+2*5+2w*6|2+2+l6*6|2+2*5+1f*6|2+2+8f*5+7+kh*6|1+1+ok*0+q+16*6|5+5|1+1"}}},"pad:observatory.guide.jeanhuensitvextended:revs:10000":{"changeset":"Z:fkm>1|c=10r=7f*j+1$\"","meta":{"author":"a.E9CeYtsotzL7KxHP","timestamp":1519411086334,"atext":{"text":"% HEADER: Interview with Jean Huens\n\n(% CARLINSAYS: Peggy can you fill in the when and where for this intro and add or change it as you see fit?)\nThe following is a transcript of an interview with Jean Huens conducted by Peggy at X date and Y place.\n\n% PP: You have been using computers since a long time, as you explained to us during the tour we had the joy of attending during the TGSO.\nI heard that until recently, let's say the late 1990s, that to learn computer programming you had to start by writing down the program on paper...

You could get Unix, at the time, when you were a university, from Bell Labs (part of AT&T), the american telephone company. AT&T was a mega organisation at the time [before the [dismantlment of AT&T/Bell system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breakup_of_the_Bell_System)]. Due to monopoly, the US authorities did split it up in different Baby Bells. One of the restriction was that the research baby bell, could not sell anything. There were computer scientists there, who did develop some interesting things (e.g. Unix). For universities you did get the source for free, but NO  support, nothing not even how to install it. In Unité d'informatique, where they had a [PDP-11/70](https://i0.wp.com/www.utterpower.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/pdp11-70-panel.jpg) they were lucky: they got the same computer that unix was developped on.  They got the disk by snail mail as a post-office package. They mounted it and it did spin up and they had UNIX.\nHere, we did have a cheaper PDP11, [the PDP 11/60](https://dave.cheney.net/tag/pdp-11). We got the Unix disk distribution from Bell Labs but we could not run it, because we got another type of disk(RK07). We could look at it but that was all, because our disc format was different than the one at Bell Labs. Somebody here (P.Verbaeten) did write a driver for that disk in l'unité \nd'informatique of LLN. But they did not have a RK07.  it did compile it but we couldn't try it because we did not have. The nearest place  with Unix and RK07 was in Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam.  Andrew Tenenbaum, who did write a number of books on operating systems, was working there. He was learning to speak dutch. We did understood his english better but his assistant explained that he needed to practice speaking Dutch because he would have to pass an exam. There we compiled Unix with an RK07 driver and stored it on a bootable RK07 disk. With that disk back in Leuven we could start Unix on our PDP11/60. An error in the process meant a trip Leuven-Amsterdam and back.\nIn my opinion the start of open source was Unix because everybody  had to maintain it by ourselves and we learned a lot from the sources. \nIn that time for software distribution you did have to store it on magnetic tape and send the tape us to different places with associated problems. For example,  the agents at the customs at the airport or post didn't know what to do with the tapes or discs in terms of custom clearance. They used magnetic or xrays as inspection tools and we had to write on the package that it should not be x-rayed. And sometimes we still got unreadable tapes/discs. \n\n% PP: So it took like weeks between the transportation, the custom...\n% JH: Yes, the custom had to clear the packages. I remember I've been in the customs in Zaventem. I had received a letter that my package from Bell Labs had arrived. I went there thinking I would have to pay something and go. But no. It had to be cleared so there wa some organisation that had to do administrative stuff, so I only got it a few days later. The response time was huge :)\n\n% PP: Than after that period of time how did you switch from that kind of collaboration on how to make software and make software work to collaboration on networks, between universities and researchers...\n% JH: In the Unix systems at that time there was a kind of networking protocol which did work on serial lines (UUCP).\nTo connect two unix systems together you only need a serial line. We had a line between LLN and Leuven, it's only 25 kms, but we had to ask Belgacom, then La Régie des Télégraphes et Téléphones, to get a modem to connect through their network and than over that modem you could reach an amazing speed of 300 characters per second. And that was the first communication. It did happened somewhere around 85. And then you had connexion with another computer, writing something here and do the transfer to the other computer and execute it there. \n \n% PP: What was the first thing you did send through a network like this?\n% JH: I didn't do it myself, I remember it was a kind of chat program. On LLN side was Prof. Elie Milgrom, he is retired now. On this side, it was Prof.  Yves Willems. And I remember that they typed something and they got a response from the other side and that was it.  But I remember that Prof. Willems sent \"ok we stop now\". And that Elie Milgrom answered \"See you later, Alligator\" [a reference to Bill Haley and the Comets]. At the time we still had these kind of songs in mind. (lol). \nThose Unix to Unix connexions were first. And there was a worldwide Unix to Unix based network, Usenet (1979), it still exists somewhere... you can download load  of illegal movies and that stuff, that was not what we meant at the time. But that is what is left. And Usenet became gradually replaced by the Internet in USA. \nIn Europe, the Internet came a lot later, but we had limited access to the Internet by mail and even FTP; We could send mail to the Internet and we could receive mail from them, because Some friendly american university, later companies, did translate internet mail to UCP mail., moreover they did translate specially formatted mails into FTP request and send the result back to us by mail. That was before the 1990's.\n \n% PP: Your relation to software had changed at the time because you did not have to do all this manipulations with the software your received... Was it already floppy discs?\n% JH: No, magnetic tapes, for the mainframe at least. Even most of the mini-computers had some (cheaper) magnetic tapes. Between 90 and 95 the main machines used for  Unix software development was a VAX from DEC. Once a year the software came from Berkeley, it was still Unix but modified by Berkeley for virtual memory and all the stuff which are common now. We received a tape, with lot of goodies, I still remember we didn't know what was on the tape  but we did scrutinise it  to know what was on there, what we can use....\nIn Europe, companies like Siemens were trying to set up software centers to make software avaiable, they were even trying to set up European networks. But researchers did love the Internet, it worked, it was useful for their researchs. So companies in Europe, were trying to set up their own networks, I remember for example the X/OPEN transport protocol. Their was a lot of standards about what software layers should do, but it didn't succeed because around 1992 IBM decided to quit their own private network and to go forTCP/IP and was the switching point. \nEverything done for X/OPEN were suddently forgotten. For the mainframes, and certainly in Belgium computing was mainly mainframes, I'm talking about universities here, so when IBM decided to go for TCP/IP Univiversities did follow. \nBut the aceptation of TCP/IP was really slow. For example, Belgacom was not interested in running the Domain Name System so we did it here, for some time, starting in 1993 with [Pierre Verbaten](https://www.dnsbelgium.be/en/history). Belgacom were focused on X25 (DCS - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X.25) so they missed it.\n\n% PP: It was like the french Minitel?\n% JH: Well, at that time we were really jealous about Minitel. Could you imagine that? Terminals?  At home? You could work home with a computer! You could send emails! All in one, a pc computer with a modem! \n\n% PP: How did the research about software evolved in the department?\n% JH: I am mainly talking about network research but here. There were people working on numerical analysis, computing, artificial intelligence ... I was just not involved in those research so I don't know much about it \n\n% PP: You were focused on software and network..\n% JH: Yes, we did produce some software. We did make software to generate compilers, there was some A.I. software in Prolog, numerical analysis  libraries... Some were sold or shared, it depends.  \nWe did sell some software since the beginning I think when it was not even a department but a professor and a couple of students.\n\n% PP: Is it when you joined?\n% JH: No it was already a department. I did study first industrial engeneering in electronics. At the time in electronics you did hear something about computers, I was interested in it. I wanted to know more. I heard Kuleuvenhad started a\n% year before a\ndegree in computer engeneering. It was the first year where industrial engineers could join. The only thing we knew about computer were from movies. I wanted to know how it work. I'm not sure if I know now it now, but I have some ideas...\n\n% PP: How many language do you know?\n% JH: Assembly, FORTRAN, PL-1 the language invented by IBM to be the universal one, C, Cobol. Perl, I don't know, some  more. I'm not fluent in any computer language, but I can read any language especially well written, I know I can understand it and, if needed,  learn it... I know JAVA also. As a system administrator the thing I use most are the command line of UNIX and Perl. But that's because i'm more familiar with those two so it goes faster.\n\n% PP: How did you see the rise of personnal computer and the software that goes with?\n% JH: I have to admit that we missed it. We didn't see the new thing was powerful because available for everybody.  We were not impressed by the software. I remember windows 95, the news on TV, people sleeping on the street to get it. I remember when I get my first windows version, with a box of 22 floppies or so. Then I wanted to do something, to compile a program, but there was no compiler... We were used to Unix, a basic system but with a lot of utilities in it. Software was for us free, and we were used to have it free and on a pc it was not free anymore. \n\n% PP: Does that mean you didn't had a personnal computer until late?\n% JH: Yes. I think it was round 2000. I didn't needed it really. I got one when the belgian UUCP network became commercial. Of course I did not get Windows on it. I think we got Linux here in 1994. There was a guy involved in the kernel studying here. So we did used it very fast.\n\n% PP: So, what is software for you?\n% JH: For me software is the magic that make computer usable. I can only gives examples of what I mean by it. A PC without software most people, even computer scientists, can't do anything with it. You need basic software. Some software is already integrated in the computer hardware. Same for phones, tablets... The main characteristic, for me, is that it should be user friendly. That is very difficult I know, because you have to imagine what the people using your software are going to do with it and how they want to use it, that's the magic you need to solve.\n\n% PP: Is command line user friendly?\n% JH: Well, somehow you have to learn the Unix command language; it is in fact a computer language where you can make all the constructs that other languages offers.\nYou can create loops, you can test, whatever. It's not so different from computer languages like C or JAVA or whatever. It is certainly programmer friendly.\n\n% PP: But it's already software, no? User friendly depends on what you put behind these words, no?\n% JH: Yes it's already software. I don't have a strong opinion about command lines. It depends on people. I can imagine that someone that has never heard about the command line expects that you click somewhere and it happens. But if you know the command language it's sometimes perhaps easier or productive to type commands and let it run. Sometimes, I find it easier if I have a screen and a number of buttons and I don't have to imagine what happens behind that screen. And sometimes I want to do something with the command line, because I'm used to it. That's why I don't trust myself about user friendliness because I have a long experience in computer interfaces. I'm so used to some of them perhaps I can't even imagine that somebody else would like to do it otherwise or doesn't like what I'm used to.\n\n% PP: Apart from maintaining the museum, what do you work on? You are still active in the department even though you are retired?\n% JH: I work on sensors, in the internet of things world in one of the university spin-off. What I do for them is: wireless sensors need power, most  of them are on batteries. They have designed a complete system which should make the battery last for two, three, four years. They need a system to measure that. So I have been working on a mechanism to measure that without waiting four years. That's programming instrumentation computers to measure e.g. power or whatever. Most of it on Unix systems. \nThere are enough new or unknown things and maybe because I'm older, I have another way of looking at things, so we have a lot of discussions. They don't like my Perl, they use python, JAVA and those things... Perl, it has its disadvantage, but you can do a lot of things. Every  character has a meaning, that makes perl programs often unreadable.\nWith Python, you need all those libraries... It's easy when you know the libraries, what  you have to call. When you know the arguments of the librairies... so it's also complicated. And if the library changes for some reasons, there you go.\nIn my humble opinion it's the same with all the languages. It starts easy from scratch but if you have to interface them with existing things from the internet world or whatever it gets complicated.\n\n% PP: Do you have a last word?\n% JH: I was surprised by your group reaction to the visit. I thought all of this was known. Maybe I'm getting old :) Currently I don't do much about the museum department, but sometimes I like to talk about the little stories about it. I remember a lot of little stories, a lot of technics who have been used and forgotten and some kept alive. I thought when I was young that the best techniques would succeed. That you would have visionary people who would see the way. But I realized that a lot of things do happen by accident.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","attribs":"*7+a*7*3+p*7|1+1*g|1+1*f+2*7+1*f|1+2y*f+2v*g|1+1*6|1+1*h+6*5+1u*f*5+3*5+12*f*5+8*5+h*6|1+1*5+1j*f*5+7*5+2c*f*5+1*f+2*7+1*f+1o*5+1*6|1+1*h+6+9*f+1+1o*d+n+1y*f+1+18*f+1+10*d+1+3e*f+1+o*h+1+1t*h+1+1b*6|2+2+l*j+5+31*j+3+q*6|1+1|1+1*h+6*f*5+4*5+c*j*5+1*5+g*6|1+1*h+6+l*h+1+16*e+1+17*f+2+1a*j+2y+4*f+2+1e*d+2+3a*h|1+2*h*e+2*e+k+1*h|1+1+1j*6|2+2+1h*f+5+1h*7+1*0+k+44*7+1*0+l+2y*6|2+2+e*f+1+8f*f+1+p*d+1+q*f+1+d*d+1+3j*6|2+2+t*f+6+14*f+2+49*d+8+15*6|2+2*h+6*5+16*6|1+1*h+6+t*h+1+h*d+1+1u*d+6+1y*6|2+2*h+6*5+13*6|1+1*h+6+2p*d+1+3f*d+a+o*d+1+1b*d+1+2*d+l+9*d+2a+1*e+14+19*d+1+1b*d+u+1*6|2+2*h+6*5+1n*6|1+1*h+6+c*d+1+6*f+2+9*f+1+7*f+1+s*d+1+8*f+3+1k*d+a+9*d+1+1*d+1+r*d+u+1*d+n+e*d*e+4*e+8+1c*h+1+g*d+1+2*d+1+s*d+4+h*d|1+1+2r*d+9+1l*0+1+2s*d+3+33*6|1+1+41*6|2+2*h+6*5+15*6|1+1*h+6+i*f+1+7*f+1+3s*d+4+x*6|2+2*h+6*5+1r*f*5+1*5+z*6|1+1*h+6+8*f+1+7m*d+4+q*d+9+f*d|1+1+f*d+1+27*d+1+7*d+1+9*d+1+t*d+2+w*d+6+e*d+e+2*d+2+r*d+m+g*d+9+p*h|1+1*h*e+2*e+i*h|1+1+3q*6|2+2*h+6*5+1b*6|1+1*h+6+43*0+1+f*0+2+4*d+a+1g*d+n+z*d+2*h+1*d+1+3z*d+1+10*d+4+5*d+3+1n*d+6+p*d+4+f*d+1+1l*d+1+j*d+c+16*d+h+8*d+11+p*0+i*h+1*0+9*h+2*0+2a*h+1+1k*d+2+3f*d+4+1*6|1+1+x*0+1*h+2*0+d*h+1*0+11+1*0*2+1*0+37+2q*0+4+2*0|1+21*0+1f+1v*0+1+1*h+2*0+2d*h+1*0+d1*d|1+1*d+1+1j*d+a+1z*0+1*d|1+1+d*d+t+7*d+2+4*d+5+1*d+2+1*d+l+1*d+c+n*d+p+14*d+1+1k*d+9+1r*d+p+1q*h+1*d+p+c*d+6+7*0|2+2*h+6*5+1r*0|1+1*h+6+1i*h+1+2f*0+4+10*h+1+3s*h+1+1o*0|2+2*h+6*5+5i*0|1+1*h+6+i*d+1+1*d+2+29*d+7+1*0|1+1*d+2+1f*d+7+d*d+6+z*d+1+11*d+1+1*2+e*d*2+1*2+e*d*2+1*2+b+83*d+1j+2*0|1+1+1*0|1+1*h+6*5+1u*0|1+1*h+6+n*h+1+15*d+1+f*d+5*7+1+1k*d+3+1*d+6+d*h+1+2u*h+1+h*7+3+5f*d|1+1+90*d|1+1+1h*d+8+m*d+o+m*d+b+10*e+9+1*d+1+2j*d+35+r*0|1+1+1*0|1+1*h+6*5+4n*0|1+1*h+6+1c*d+6+z*d+1+6*d+2+1h*d+5+5*d+5+9*d+c+5s*h+1+1a*d+6+8*d+4+b*d+3+i*d+3+n*d+3*0|1+1+3o*d+9+a*d+5+42*h+1+46*d+b+2o*d|1+1+3n*h+1+21*d+i+7*d+1+1*d|1+1*d+1a+3n*h+1+f*h+1+3m*0|2+2*h+6*5+v*0|1+1*h+6+5m*0|2+2*h+6*5+1q*0|1+1*h+6+1f*d+3+3o*h+1+q*0|2+2*h+6*5+16*0|1+1*h+6+5b*0|1+1+1a*h+1+2a*0|2+2*h+6*5+m*0|1+1*h+6+18*d+5+2z*h+1+l*h+1+1*h+1+u*d+8+d*h|1+1*h*e+2*e+d*h|1+1+27*d+1+1k*d+4+1h*d+4+9*d+e+i*0|2+2*h+6*5+d*h*5+1*5+g*0|1+1*h+6+w*h+1+1p*h+1+f*d+3+t*d+8+5*h+1+9*h+1+i*h+1+t*d+2+4*h+1*d+1+m*d+a*h+1*d+2+c*h+1+1h*d+2+3b*0|2+2*h+6*5+27*0|1+1*h+6+1f*d+2+4*d+6+c*d+y+3s*h+1+1x*h+1+21*d+2+3s*d+8+p*0|2+2*h+6*5+1q*0|1+1*h+6+2f*d+1+14*h+1+41*0|2+2*h+6*5+t*0|1+1*h+6+2i*h+1+3w*d+3+4l*h+1+4f*0|2+2*h+6*5+u*0|1+1*h+6+10*d+5+c*h+1+3*d+4+r*h+1+1l*h+1+c*0|1+1+2e*h+1+w*d+11*0|2+2*h+6*5+p*h*5+1*5+1u*0|1+1*h+6+3q*h+1+16*h+1+22*h+1+2k*h+1+j*h+1+17*h+1+1y*h+1+1h*h+1+q*h+1+1g*h+1+2c*h+1+2i*h+1+b*0|2+2*h+6*5+3f*0|1+1*h+6+2j*h+1+f*d+1+a*d+8+c*d+5+4m*d+6+3f*d+1+5*d+5+h*d+1+1*d+e+e*d|1+1+1l*h+1+a*h+1+3c*d+4*h+1+e*d+1+l*h+1+i*d+2+i*d+9+o*d|1+19+18*h+1+11*d+4*h+1*d+2+1v*h+1+r*h+1+n*d+1+w*d|1+1+1g*h+1+2f*d+1+1l*0|2+2*h+6*5+o*0|1+1*h+6+24*d+2+e*h+1+l*h+1+6*h+1+1m*h+1+4s*h+1+37*h+1+t*d+4+k*0|1+1*6|3+3*0|1+1*j|1+1|1+1"}}},"pad:observatory.guide.jeanhuensitvextended:revs:10001":{"changeset":"Z:fkn>1|c=10r=7g*j+1$>","meta":{"author":"a.E9CeYtsotzL7KxHP","timestamp":1519411087920}},"pad:observatory.guide.jeanhuensitvextended:revs:10002":{"changeset":"Z:fko<1|c=10r=7g-1$","meta":{"author":"a.E9CeYtsotzL7KxHP","timestamp":1519411088494}},"pad:observatory.guide.jeanhuensitvextended:revs:10003":{"changeset":"Z:fkn>1|c=10r=7g*j+1$?","meta":{"author":"a.E9CeYtsotzL7KxHP","timestamp":1519411089122}},"pad:observatory.guide.jeanhuensitvextended:revs:10004":{"changeset":"Z:fko>1|c=10r=7h*j+1$)","meta":{"author":"a.E9CeYtsotzL7KxHP","timestamp":1519411089777}},"pad:observatory.guide.jeanhuensitvextended:revs:10005":{"changeset":"Z:fkp>1|g=1fg=1z*j+1$\"","meta":{"author":"a.E9CeYtsotzL7KxHP","timestamp":1519411098332}},"pad:observatory.guide.jeanhuensitvextended:revs:10006":{"changeset":"Z:fkq>1|g=1fg=24*j+1$\"","meta":{"author":"a.E9CeYtsotzL7KxHP","timestamp":1519411100653}},"pad:observatory.guide.jeanhuensitvextended:revs:10007":{"changeset":"Z:fkr<1|i=1qw=46-1$","meta":{"author":"a.E9CeYtsotzL7KxHP","timestamp":1519411160498}},"pad:observatory.guide.jeanhuensitvextended:revs:10008":{"changeset":"Z:fkq>2|i=1qw=46*j+2$Th","meta":{"author":"a.E9CeYtsotzL7KxHP","timestamp":1519411161017}},"pad:observatory.guide.jeanhuensitvextended:revs:10009":{"changeset":"Z:fks>3|i=1qw=48*j+3$ey

HEADER: Interview with Jean Huens\n\n(% CARLINSAYS: Peggy can you fill in the when and where for this intro and add or change it as you see fit?)\nThe following is a transcript of an interview with Jean Huens conducted by Peggy at X date and Y place.\n\n% PP: You have been using computers since a long time, as you explained to us during the tour we had the joy of attending during the TGSO.\nI heard that until recently, let's say the late 1990s, that to learn computer programming you had to start by writing down the program on paper... (% CARLINSAYS: I want to put a period or a question mark here?) \n% JH: In 1973, I did study computer sciences, it was the second year of the Computer Sciense course, here in Leuven. At the time computers were mainframes and you did feed them with programs by punch cards. Programming was writing down the program, then you punched it and the next day you get results, mostly error. That's the way it worked at that time. To teach us programming, they used the language of that time, Fortran and some kind of invented assembly language, it didn't really exist, it was simplified.\n\nMost of the time you wrote down your program, the teacher and the assistant would have to tell you what is wrong or good, you didn't have much practical experience.\n\n% PP: What was it like, tons of pages? \n% JH: No. As an anecdocte, I remember punchcards were a block of papers, we were jealous of the people who came into the computer center with huge stacks of cards (% CARLINSAYS: The \"block of papers\" is a little confusing. Could we say \"punchcards came in huge stacks\"?). They were really small programs, not complicated one. In fact you had to learn to use the computer from scratch, everything was new, you couldn't rely on previous experiences.\n% , everything was new.\nAnd to start with small programs was difficult enough. \n\nThat was also the time when Edsger W. Dijkstra, who fought against the \"goto\" and other common but bad constructs.[@dijksra:1972:goto] I still remember him, in an audience, giving us a lecture on good  techniques in programming at the International computing symposium 1977 in Liège.[@dijksra:1977:craft] It was a rather hard course because Dijkstra expected you to quickly  understand and implement his ideas.\n\nAnd then from '75 on, computers became cheaper and could be bought by departments and smaller entities. And than came the first interactive computer. They were still beasts, about two cubic meters, costing two millions belgian francs. But it was low (% CARLINSAYS: low?) enough to allow people to type in directly commands. I started working here in '75 as a researcher, it has evolved continuously and I saw computers getting cheaper and getting easier to use.The way to use it was simplified, you could start to go to the beast and try it out.\n\nI remember more or less: you wrote down the program in Fortran for instance. We always thought in the beginning that it would work and it didn't, so after a turn around you were giving it back to the operator and you have to wait another half a day or a night to get the results.\n\n% PP: What kind of program were you working on? \n% JH: I remember the first program I had to write was: you got three numbers and you had to make the program decide if you could construct a triangle with the numbers being the sides of the triangle.\n\n% PP: That took an afternoon to be processed?\n% JH: Well, yeah. You had to imagine how to do it which was also one problem, than you prepare the cards with the punching machine and you give the package of cards to the operator who was feeeding the computer with the cards. Operators were people who had the task of feeding the computers by hand, with paper, cards,(% CARLINSAYS: are these paper cards or paper and then cards because the two are separate?) then cards got written on disks and later processed by the mainframe from disk. Finally results got printed on paper. it lasts onto the magnetic disks period. And after a number of hours or a night you got a listing on a piece of paper with the results or program compilation errors.\n\n% PP: When where you able to record the program onto the machine?\n% JH: I think that happened between '75 and '80. After the punching cards, which were already a way to record the program, we had typewriters and then terminals. We could record the programs by typing it on the terminal  and the computer would store them on disk. We had magnetic discs. IBM had number for everything, I remember the 3300  [manufactured from 1970 on] was a magnetic disk. \nWe didn't touch the machines, operators would change the disks, we could only access the typewriter/terminal. That was our most direct connexion to the computer. The times were different. The mainframes were such huge costly beasts that it had operators day and night to keep it busy. Even at night there were two or three guys mounting tapes, disc mounting tapes, that kind of stuff.\nhttps://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/42/IBM_magnetic_disk_drives_3330%2B3333.png/600px-IBM_magnetic_disk_drives_3330%2B3333.png\n\n% PP: When did you stop working with operators?\n% JH: Somewhere between '85 and '90. There were still operators at the main computer of the university, but there were also small computers, so researchers and student could have direct access when needed. \n\n% PP: When did you start to work with software sold by others or given away in order to do your research?\n% JH: You still need an operating system on the mainframe that was delivered by IBM or the constructor delivering the mainframe. When you bought mini-computers, which were the  smaller versions of mainframes, in most cases you bought an operating systems, compilers and all the stuff you needed to be able to program or work  those things. \nIn most cases,  the computer sciences department did buy the mini-computer from, for instance *Digital Equipment Corporation*,  a manufactorer at that time, but they didn't buy DEC's  software. The DEC software  was not open source or free,  and as a university we could get Unix for free and could run it on those\n% digital equipment \nDEC computers. That is what the computer department of the University of Louvain la Neuve *l'unité d'informatique*, did and so did we.\n\n% PP: When did you start working with unix as an os? \n% JH: I took a trip to Amsterdam, it must have been in 1979/80… Well, the story starts in our french sister university (LLN) where they did have a PDP-11 with Unix on it. You could get Unix, at the time, when you were a university, from Bell Labs (part of AT&T), the american telephone company. AT&T was a mega organisation at the time [before the [dismantlment of AT&T/Bell system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breakup_of_the_Bell_System)]. Due to monopoly, the US authorities did split it up in different Baby Bells. One of the restriction was that the research baby bell, could not sell anything. There were computer scientists there, who did develop some interesting things (e.g. Unix). For universities you did get the source for free, but NO  support, nothing not even how to install it. In Unité d'informatique, where they had a [PDP-11/70](https://i0.wp.com/www.utterpower.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/pdp11-70-panel.jpg) they were lucky: they got the same computer that unix was developped on.  They got the disk by snail mail as a post-office package. They mounted it and it did spin up and they had UNIX.\nHere, we did have a cheaper PDP11, [the PDP 11/60](https://dave.cheney.net/tag/pdp-11). We got the Unix disk distribution from Bell Labs but we could not run it, because we got another type of disk(RK07). We could look at it but that was all, because our disc format was different than the one at Bell Labs. Somebody here (P.Verbaeten) did write a driver for that disk in l'unité \nd'informatique of LLN. But they did not have a RK07.  it did compile it but we couldn't try it because we did not have. The nearest place  with Unix and RK07 was in Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam.  Andrew Tenenbaum, who did write a number of books on operating systems, was working there. He was learning to speak dutch. We did understood his english better but his assistant explained that he needed to practice speaking Dutch because he would have to pass an exam. There we compiled Unix with an RK07 driver and stored it on a bootable RK07 disk. With that disk back in Leuven we could start Unix on our PDP11/60. An error in the process meant a trip Leuven-Amsterdam and back.\nIn my opinion the start of open source was Unix because everybody  had to maintain it by ourselves and we learned a lot from the sources. \nIn that time for software distribution you did have to store it on magnetic tape and send the tape us to different places with associated problems. For example,  the agents at the customs at the airport or post didn't know what to do with the tapes or discs in terms of custom clearance. They used magnetic or xrays as inspection tools and we had to write on the package that it should not be x-rayed. And sometimes we still got unreadable tapes/discs. \n\n% PP: So it took like weeks between the transportation, the custom...\n% JH: Yes, the custom had to clear the packages. I remember I've been in the customs in Zaventem. I had received a letter that my package from Bell Labs had arrived. I went there thinking I would have to pay something and go. But no. It had to be cleared so there wa some organisation that had to do administrative stuff, so I only got it a few days later. The response time was huge :)\n\n% PP: Than after that period of time how did you switch from that kind of collaboration on how to make software and make software work to collaboration on networks, between universities and researchers...\n% JH: In the Unix systems at that time there was a kind of networking protocol which did work on serial lines (UUCP).\nTo connect two unix systems together you only need a serial line. We had a line between LLN and Leuven, it's only 25 kms, but we had to ask Belgacom, then La Régie des Télégraphes et Téléphones, to get a modem to connect through their network and than over that modem you could reach an amazing speed of 300 characters per second. And that was the first communication. It did happened somewhere around 85. And then you had connexion with another computer, writing something here and do the transfer to the other computer and execute it there. \n \n% PP: What was the first thing you did send through a network like this?\n% JH: I didn't do it myself, I remember it was a kind of chat program. On LLN side was Prof. Elie Milgrom, he is retired now. On this side, it was Prof.  Yves Willems. And I remember that they typed something and they got a response from the other side and that was it.  But I remember that Prof. Willems sent \"ok we stop now\". And that Elie Milgrom answered \"See you later, Alligator\" [a reference to Bill Haley and the Comets]. At the time we still had these kind of songs in mind. (lol). \nThose Unix to Unix connexions were first. And there was a worldwide Unix to Unix based network, Usenet (1979), it still exists somewhere... you can download load  of illegal movies and that stuff, that was not what we meant at the time. But that is what is left. And Usenet became gradually replaced by the Internet in USA. \nIn Europe, the Internet came a lot later, but we had limited access to the Internet by mail and even FTP; We could send mail to the Internet and we could receive mail from them, because Some friendly american university, later companies, did translate internet mail to UCP mail., moreover they did translate specially formatted mails into FTP request and send the result back to us by mail. That was before the 1990's.\n \n% PP: Your relation to software had changed at the time because you did not have to do all this manipulations with the software your received... Was it already floppy discs?\n% JH: No, magnetic tapes, for the mainframe at least. Even most of the mini-computers had some (cheaper) magnetic tapes. Between 90 and 95 the main machines used for  Unix software development was a VAX from DEC. Once a year the software came from Berkeley, it was still Unix but modified by Berkeley for virtual memory and all the stuff which are common now. We received a tape, with lot of goodies, I still remember we didn't know what was on the tape  but we did scrutinise it  to know what was on there, what we can use....\nIn Europe, companies like Siemens were trying to set up software centers to make software avaiable, they were even trying to set up European networks. But researchers did love the Internet, it worked, it was useful for their researchs. So companies in Europe, were trying to set up their own networks, I remember for example the X/OPEN transport protocol. Their was a lot of standards about what software layers should do, but it didn't succeed because around 1992 IBM decided to quit their own private network and to go forTCP/IP and was the switching point. \nEverything done for X/OPEN were suddently forgotten. For the mainframes, and certainly in Belgium computing was mainly mainframes, I'm talking about universities here, so when IBM decided to go for TCP/IP Univiversities did follow. \nBut the aceptation of TCP/IP was really slow. For example, Belgacom was not interested in running the Domain Name System so we did it here, for some time, starting in 1993 with [Pierre Verbaten](https://www.dnsbelgium.be/en/history). Belgacom were focused on X25 (DCS - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X.25) so they missed it.\n\n% PP: It was like the french Minitel?\n% JH: Well, at that time we were really jealous about Minitel. Could you imagine that? Terminals?  At home? You could work home with a computer! You could send emails! All in one, a pc computer with a modem! \n\n% PP: How did the research about software evolved in the department?\n% JH: I am mainly talking about network research but here. There were people working on numerical analysis, computing, artificial intelligence ... I was just not involved in those research so I don't know much about it \n\n% PP: You were focused on software and network..\n% JH: Yes, we did produce some software. We did make software to generate compilers, there was some A.I. software in Prolog, numerical analysis  libraries... Some were sold or shared, it depends.  \nWe did sell some software since the beginning I think when it was not even a department but a professor and a couple of students.\n\n% PP: Is it when you joined?\n% JH: No it was already a department. I did study first industrial engeneering in electronics. At the time in electronics you did hear something about computers, I was interested in it. I wanted to know more. I heard Kuleuvenhad started a\n% year before a\ndegree in computer engeneering. It was the first year where industrial engineers could join. The only thing we knew about computer were from movies. I wanted to know how it work. I'm not sure if I know now it now, but I have some ideas...\n\n% PP: How many language do you know?\n% JH: Assembly, FORTRAN, PL-1 the language invented by IBM to be the universal one, C, Cobol. Perl, I don't know, some  more. I'm not fluent in any computer language, but I can read any language especially well written, I know I can understand it and, if needed,  learn it... I know JAVA also. As a system administrator the thing I use most are the command line of UNIX and Perl. But that's because i'm more familiar with those two so it goes faster.\n\n% PP: How did you see the rise of personnal computer and the software that goes with?\n% JH: I have to admit that we missed it. We didn't see the new thing was powerful because available for everybody.  We were not impressed by the software. I remember windows 95, the news on TV, people sleeping on the street to get it. I remember when I get my first windows version, with a box of 22 floppies or so. Then I wanted to do something, to compile a program, but there was no compiler... We were used to Unix, a basic system but with a lot of utilities in it. Software was for us free, and we were used to have it free and on a pc it was not free anymore. \n\n% PP: Does that mean you didn't had a personnal computer until late?\n% JH: Yes. I think it was round 2000. I didn't needed it really. I got one when the belgian UUCP network became commercial. Of course I did not get Windows on it. I think we got Linux here in 1994. There was a guy involved in the kernel studying here. So we did used it very fast.\n\n% PP: So, what is software for you?\n% JH: For me software is the magic that make computer usable. I can only gives examples of what I mean by it. A PC without software most people, even computer scientists, can't do anything with it. You need basic software. Some software is already integrated in the computer hardware. Same for phones, tablets... The main characteristic, for me, is that it should be user friendly. That is very difficult I know, because you have to imagine what the people using your software are going to do with it and how they want to use it, that's the magic you need to solve.\n\n% PP: Is command line user friendly?\n% JH: Well, somehow you have to learn the Unix command language; it is in fact a computer language where you can make all the constructs that other languages offers.\nYou can create loops, you can test, whatever. It's not so different from computer languages like C or JAVA or whatever. It is certainly programmer friendly.\n\n% PP: But it's already software, no? User friendly depends on what you put behind these words, no?\n% JH: Yes it's already software. I don't have a strong opinion about command lines. It depends on people. I can imagine that someone that has never heard about the command line expects that you click somewhere and it happens. But if you know the command language it's sometimes perhaps easier or productive to type commands and let it run. Sometimes, I find it easier if I have a screen and a number of buttons and I don't have to imagine what happens behind that screen. And sometimes I want to do something with the command line, because I'm used to it. That's why I don't trust myself about user friendliness because I have a long experience in computer interfaces. I'm so used to some of them perhaps I can't even imagine that somebody else would like to do it otherwise or doesn't like what I'm used to.\n\n% PP: Apart from maintaining the museum, what do you work on? You are still active in the department even though you are retired?\n% JH: I work on sensors, in the internet of things world in one of the university spin-off. What I do for them is: wireless sensors need power, most  of them are on batteries. They have designed a complete system which should make the battery last for two, three, four years. They need a system to measure that. So I have been working on a mechanism to measure that without waiting four years. That's programming instrumentation computers to measure e.g. power or whatever. Most of it on Unix systems. \nThere are enough new or unknown things and maybe because I'm older, I have another way of looking at things, so we have a lot of discussions. They don't like my Perl, they use python, JAVA and those things... Perl, it has its disadvantage, but you can do a lot of things. Every  character has a meaning, that makes perl programs often unreadable.\nWith Python, you need all those libraries... It's easy when you know the libraries, what  you have to call. When you know the arguments of the librairies... so it's also complicated. And if the library changes for some reasons, there you go.\nIn my humble opinion it's the same with all the languages. It starts easy from scratch but if you have to interface them with existing things from the internet world or whatever it gets complicated.\n\n% PP: Do you have a last word?\n% JH: I was surprised by your group reaction to the visit. I thought all of this was known. Maybe I'm getting old :) Currently I don't do much about the museum department, but sometimes I like to talk about the little stories about it. I remember a lot of little stories, a lot of technics who have been used and forgotten and some kept alive. I thought when I was young that the best techniques would succeed. That you would have visionary people who would see the way.

HEADER: Interview with Jean Huens\n\n(% CARLINSAYS: Peggy can you fill in the when and where for this intro and add or change it as you see fit?)\nThe following is a transcript of an interview with Jean Huens conducted by Peggy at X date and Y place.\n\n% PP: You have been using computers since a long time, as you explained to us during the tour we had the joy of attending during the TGSO.\nI heard that until recently, let's say the late 1990s, that to learn computer programming you had to start by writing down the program on paper... (% CARLINSAYS: I want to put a period or a question mark here?) \n% JH: In 1973, I did study computer sciences, it was the second year of the Computer Sciense course, here in Leuven. At the time computers were mainframes and you did feed them with programs by punch cards. Programming was writing down the program, then you punched it and the next day you get results, mostly error. That's the way it worked at that time. To teach us programming, they used the language of that time, Fortran and some kind of invented assembly language, it didn't really exist, it was simplified.\n\nMost of the time you wrote down your program, the teacher and the assistant would have to tell you what is wrong or good, you didn't have much practical experience.\n\n% PP: What was it like, tons of pages? \n% JH: No. As an anecdocte, I remember punchcards were a block of papers, we were jealous of the people who came into the computer center with huge stacks of cards (% CARLINSAYS: The \"block of papers\" is a little confusing. Could we say \"punchcards came in huge stacks\"?). They were really small programs, not complicated one. In fact you had to learn to use the computer from scratch, everything was new, you couldn't rely on previous experiences.\n% , everything was new.\nAnd to start with small programs was difficult enough. \n\nThat was also the time when Edsger W. Dijkstra, who fought against the \"goto\" and other common but bad constructs.[@dijksra:1972:goto] I still remember him, in an audience, giving us a lecture on good  techniques in programming at the International computing symposium 1977 in Liège.[@dijksra:1977:craft] It was a rather hard course because Dijkstra expected you to quickly  understand and implement his ideas.\n\nAnd then from '75 on, computers became cheaper and could be bought by departments and smaller entities. And than came the first interactive computer. They were still beasts, about two cubic meters, costing two millions belgian francs. But it was low (% CARLINSAYS: low?) enough to allow people to type in directly commands. I started working here in '75 as a researcher, it has evolved continuously and I saw computers getting cheaper and getting easier to use.The way to use it was simplified, you could start to go to the beast and try it out.\n\nI remember more or less: you wrote down the program in Fortran for instance. We always thought in the beginning that it would work and it didn't, so after a turn around you were giving it back to the operator and you have to wait another half a day or a night to get the results.\n\n% PP: What kind of program were you working on? \n% JH: I remember the first program I had to write was: you got three numbers and you had to make the program decide if you could construct a triangle with the numbers being the sides of the triangle.\n\n% PP: That took an afternoon to be processed?\n% JH: Well, yeah. You had to imagine how to do it which was also one problem, than you prepare the cards with the punching machine and you give the package of cards to the operator who was feeeding the computer with the cards. Operators were people who had the task of feeding the computers by hand, with paper, cards,(% CARLINSAYS: are these paper cards or paper and then cards because the two are separate?) then cards got written on disks and later processed by the mainframe from disk. Finally results got printed on paper. it lasts onto the magnetic disks period. And after a number of hours or a night you got a listing on a piece of paper with the results or program compilation errors.\n\n% PP: When where you able to record the program onto the machine?\n% JH: I think that happened between '75 and '80. After the punching cards, which were already a way to record the program, we had typewriters and then terminals. We could record the programs by typing it on the terminal  and the computer would store them on disk. We had magnetic discs. IBM had number for everything, I remember the 3300  [manufactured from 1970 on] was a magnetic disk. \nWe didn't touch the machines, operators would change the disks, we could only access the typewriter/terminal. That was our most direct connexion to the computer. The times were different. The mainframes were such huge costly beasts that it had operators day and night to keep it busy. Even at night there were two or three guys mounting tapes, disc mounting tapes, that kind of stuff.\nhttps://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/42/IBM_magnetic_disk_drives_3330%2B3333.png/600px-IBM_magnetic_disk_drives_3330%2B3333.png\n\n% PP: When did you stop working with operators?\n% JH: Somewhere between '85 and '90. There were still operators at the main computer of the university, but there were also small computers, so researchers and student could have direct access when needed. \n\n% PP: When did you start to work with software sold by others or given away in order to do your research?\n% JH: You still needed an operating system for the mainframe that was delivered by IBM or the constructor delivereding the mainframe (% CARLINSAYS: does this make sense with these changes?). When you bought mini-computers, which were the  smaller versions of mainframes, in most cases you bought an operating systems, compilers and all the stuff you needed to be able to program or work  those things. \nIn most cases,  the computer sciences department bought the mini-computer from, for instance *Digital Equipment Corporation*,  a manufactorer at that time, but they didn't buy DEC's  software. The DEC software  was not open source or free,  and as a university we could get Unix for free and could run it on those\n% digital equipment \nDEC computers. That is what the computer department of the University of Louvain la Neuve *l'unité d'informatique*, did and so did we.\n\n% PP: When did you start working with Unix as an OS? \n% JH: I took a trip to Amsterdam, it must have been in 1979 or 1980. Well, the story starts in our French sister university (LLN) where they had a PDP-11 with Unix on it. You could get Unix, at the time, when you were a university, from Bell Labs (part of AT&T), the American telephone company. AT&T was a mega organisation at the time [before the [dismantlment of AT&T/Bell system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breakup_of_the_Bell_System)]. Due to monopoly, the US authorities split it up into different Baby Bells. One of the restrictions was that the research Baby bell, could not sell anything. There were computer scientists there, who did develop some interesting things (e.g. Unix). For universities you did get the source for free, but NO  support, nothing not even how to install it. In Unité d'informatique, where they had a [PDP-11/70](https://i0.wp.com/www.utterpower.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/pdp11-70-panel.jpg) they were lucky: they got the same computer that Unix was developped on.  They got the disk by snail mail as a post-office package. They mounted it and it did spin up and they had UNIX (% CARLINSAYS: is there a reason this is all capital letters?).\nHere, we did have a cheaper PDP11, [the PDP 11/60](https://dave.cheney.net/tag/pdp-11). We got the Unix disk distribution from Bell Labs but we could not run it, because we got another type of disk(RK07). We could look at it but that was all, because our disc format was different than the one at Bell Labs. Somebody here (P.Verbaeten) did write a driver for that disk in l'unité \nd'informatique of LLN. But they did not have a RK07.  it did compile it but we couldn't try it because we did not have. The nearest place  with Unix and RK07 was in Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam.  Andrew Tenenbaum, who did write a number of books on operating systems, was working there. He was learning to speak dutch. We did understood his english better but his assistant explained that he needed to practice speaking Dutch because he would have to pass an exam. There we compiled Unix with an RK07 driver and stored it on a bootable RK07 disk. With that disk back in Leuven we could start Unix on our PDP11/60. An error in the process meant a trip Leuven-Amsterdam and back.\nIn my opinion the start of open source was Unix because everybody  had to maintain it by ourselves and we learned a lot from the sources. \nIn that time for software distribution you did have to store it on magnetic tape and send the tape us to different places with associated problems. For example,  the agents at the customs at the airport or post didn't know what to do with the tapes or discs in terms of custom clearance. They used magnetic or xrays as inspection tools and we had to write on the package that it should not be x-rayed. And sometimes we still got unreadable tapes/discs. \n\n% PP: So it took like weeks between the transportation, the custom...\n% JH: Yes, the custom had to clear the packages. I remember I've been in the customs in Zaventem. I had received a letter that my package from Bell Labs had arrived. I went there thinking I would have to pay something and go. But no. It had to be cleared so there wa some organisation that had to do administrative stuff, so I only got it a few days later. The response time was huge :)\n\n% PP: Than after that period of time how did you switch from that kind of collaboration on how to make software and make software work to collaboration on networks, between universities and researchers...\n% JH: In the Unix systems at that time there was a kind of networking protocol which did work on serial lines (UUCP).\nTo connect two unix systems together you only need a serial line. We had a line between LLN and Leuven, it's only 25 kms, but we had to ask Belgacom, then La Régie des Télégraphes et Téléphones, to get a modem to connect through their network and than over that modem you could reach an amazing speed of 300 characters per second. And that was the first communication. It did happened somewhere around 85. And then you had connexion with another computer, writing something here and do the transfer to the other computer and execute it there. \n \n% PP: What was the first thing you did send through a network like this?\n% JH: I didn't do it myself, I remember it was a kind of chat program. On LLN side was Prof. Elie Milgrom, he is retired now. On this side, it was Prof.  Yves Willems. And I remember that they typed something and they got a response from the other side and that was it.  But I remember that Prof. Willems sent \"ok we stop now\". And that Elie Milgrom answered \"See you later, Alligator\" [a reference to Bill Haley and the Comets]. At the time we still had these kind of songs in mind. (lol). \nThose Unix to Unix connexions were first. And there was a worldwide Unix to Unix based network, Usenet (1979), it still exists somewhere... you can download load  of illegal movies and that stuff, that was not what we meant at the time. But that is what is left. And Usenet became gradually replaced by the Internet in USA. \nIn Europe, the Internet came a lot later, but we had limited access to the Internet by mail and even FTP; We could send mail to the Internet and we could receive mail from them, because Some friendly american university, later companies, did translate internet mail to UCP mail., moreover they did translate specially formatted mails into FTP request and send the result back to us by mail. That was before the 1990's.\n \n% PP: Your relation to software had changed at the time because you did not have to do all this manipulations with the software your received... Was it already floppy discs?\n% JH: No, magnetic tapes, for the mainframe at least. Even most of the mini-computers had some (cheaper) magnetic tapes. Between 90 and 95 the main machines used for  Unix software development was a VAX from DEC. Once a year the software came from Berkeley, it was still Unix but modified by Berkeley for virtual memory and all the stuff which are common now. We received a tape, with lot of goodies, I still remember we didn't know what was on the tape  but we did scrutinise it  to know what was on there, what we can use....\nIn Europe, companies like Siemens were trying to set up software centers to make software avaiable, they were even trying to set up European networks. But researchers did love the Internet, it worked, it was useful for their researchs. So companies in Europe, were trying to set up their own networks, I remember for example the X/OPEN transport protocol. Their was a lot of standards about what software layers should do, but it didn't succeed because around 1992 IBM decided to quit their own private network and to go forTCP/IP and was the switching point. \nEverything done for X/OPEN were suddently forgotten. For the mainframes, and certainly in Belgium computing was mainly mainframes, I'm talking about universities here, so when IBM decided to go for TCP/IP Univiversities did follow. \nBut the aceptation of TCP/IP was really slow. For example, Belgacom was not interested in running the Domain Name System so we did it here, for some time, starting in 1993 with [Pierre Verbaten](https://www.dnsbelgium.be/en/history). Belgacom were focused on X25 (DCS - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X.25) so they missed it.\n\n% PP: It was like the french Minitel?\n% JH: Well, at that time we were really jealous about Minitel. Could you imagine that? Terminals?  At home? You could work home with a computer! You could send emails! All in one, a pc computer with a modem! \n\n% PP: How did the research about software evolved in the department?\n% JH: I am mainly talking about network research but here. There were people working on numerical analysis, computing, artificial intelligence ... I was just not involved in those research so I don't know much about it \n\n% PP: You were focused on software and network..\n% JH: Yes, we did produce some software. We did make software to generate compilers, there was some A.I. software in Prolog, numerical analysis  libraries... Some were sold or shared, it depends.  \nWe did sell some software since the beginning I think when it was not even a department but a professor and a couple of students.\n\n% PP: Is it when you joined?\n% JH: No it was already a department. I did study first industrial engeneering in electronics. At the time in electronics you did hear something about computers, I was interested in it. I wanted to know more. I heard Kuleuvenhad started a\n% year before a\ndegree in computer engeneering. It was the first year where industrial engineers could join. The only thing we knew about computer were from movies. I wanted to know how it work. I'm not sure if I know now it now, but I have some ideas...\n\n% PP: How many language do you know?\n% JH: Assembly, FORTRAN, PL-1 the language invented by IBM to be the universal one, C, Cobol. Perl, I don't know, some  more. I'm not fluent in any computer language, but I can read any language especially well written, I know I can understand it and, if needed,  learn it... I know JAVA also. As a system administrator the thing I use most are the command line of UNIX and Perl. But that's because i'm more familiar with those two so it goes faster.\n\n% PP: How did you see the rise of personnal computer and the software that goes with?\n% JH: I have to admit that we missed it. We didn't see the new thing was powerful because available for everybody.  We were not impressed by the software. I remember windows 95, the news on TV, people sleeping on the street to get it. I remember when I get my first windows version, with a box of 22 floppies or so. Then I wanted to do something, to compile a program, but there was no compiler... We were used to Unix, a basic system but with a lot of utilities in it. Software was for us free, and we were used to have it free and on a pc it was not free anymore. \n\n% PP: Does that mean you didn't had a personnal computer until late?\n% JH: Yes. I think it was round 2000. I didn't needed it really. I got one when the belgian UUCP network became commercial. Of course I did not get Windows on it. I think we got Linux here in 1994. There was a guy involved in the kernel studying here. So we did used it very fast.\n\n% PP: So, what is software for you?\n% JH: For me software is the magic that make computer usable. I can only gives examples of what I mean by it. A PC without software most people, even computer scientists, can't do anything with it. You need basic software. Some software is already integrated in the computer hardware. Same for phones, tablets... The main characteristic, for me, is that it should be user friendly. That is very difficult I know, because you have to imagine what the people using your software are going to do with it and how they want to use it, that's the magic you need to solve.\n\n% PP: Is command line user friendly?\n% JH: Well, somehow you have to learn the Unix command language; it is in fact a computer language where you can make all the constructs that other languages offers.\nYou can create loops, you can test, whatever. It's not so different from computer languages like C or JAVA or whatever. It is certainly programmer friendly.\n\n% PP: But it's already software, no? User friendly depends on what you put behind these words, no?\n% JH: Yes it's already software. I don't have a strong opinion about command lines. It depends on people. I can imagine that someone that has never heard about the command line expects that you click somewhere and it happens. But if you know the command language it's sometimes perhaps easier or productive to type commands and let it run. Sometimes, I find it easier if I have a screen and a number of buttons and I don't have to imagine what happens behind that screen. And sometimes I want to do something with the command line, because I'm used to it. That's why I don't trust myself about user friendliness because I have a long experience in computer interfaces. I'm so used to some of them perhaps I can't even imagine that somebody else would like to do it otherwise or doesn't like what I'm used to.\n\n% PP: Apart from maintaining the museum, what do you work on? You are still active in the department even though you are retired?\n% JH: I work on sensors, in the internet of things world in one of the university spin-off. What I do for them is: wireless sensors need power, most  of them are on batteries. They have designed a complete system which should make the battery last for two, three, four years. They need a system to measure that. So I have been working on a mechanism to measure that without waiting four years. That's programming instrumentation computers to measure e.g. power or whatever. Most of it on Unix systems. \nThere are enough new or unknown things and maybe because I'm older, I have another way of looking at things, so we have a lot of discussions. They don't like my Perl, they use python, JAVA and those things... Perl, it has its disadvantage, but you can do a lot of things. Every  character has a meaning, that makes perl programs often unreadable.\nWith Python, you need all those libraries... It's easy when you know the libraries, what  you have to call. When you know the arguments of the librairies... so it's also complicated. And if the library changes for some reasons, there you go.\nIn my humble opinion it's the same with all the languages. It starts easy from scratch but if you have to interface them with existing things from the internet world or whatever it gets complicated.\n\n% PP: Do you have a last word?\n% JH: I was surprised by your group reaction to the visit. I thought all of this was known. Maybe I'm getting old :) Currently I don't do much about the museum department, but sometimes I like to talk about the little stories about it. I remember a lot of little stories, a lot of technics who have been used and forgotten and some kept alive. I thought when I was young that the best techniques would succeed. That you would have visionary people who would see the way. But I realized that a lot of things do happen by

add or change it as you see fit?)\nThe following is a transcript of an interview with Jean Huens conducted by Peggy at X date and Y place.\n\n% PP: You have been using computers since a long time, as you explained to us during the tour we had the joy of attending during the TGSO.\nI heard that until recently, let's say the late 1990s, that to learn computer programming you had to start by writing down the program on paper... (% CARLINSAYS: I want to put a period or a question mark here?) \n% JH: In 1973, I did study computer sciences, it was the second year of the Computer Sciense course, here in Leuven. At the time computers were mainframes and you did feed them with programs by punch cards. Programming was writing down the program, then you punched it and the next day you get results, mostly error. That's the way it worked at that time. To teach us programming, they used the language of that time, Fortran and some kind of invented assembly language, it didn't really exist, it was simplified.\n\nMost of the time you wrote down your program, the teacher and the assistant would have to tell you what is wrong or good, you didn't have much practical experience.\n\n% PP: What was it like, tons of pages? \n% JH: No. As an anecdocte, I remember punchcards were a block of papers, we were jealous of the people who came into the computer center with huge stacks of cards (% CARLINSAYS: The \"block of papers\" is a little confusing. Could we say \"punchcards came in huge stacks\"?). They were really small programs, not complicated one. In fact you had to learn to use the computer from scratch, everything was new, you couldn't rely on previous experiences.\n% , everything was new.\nAnd to start with small programs was difficult enough. \n\nThat was also the time when Edsger W. Dijkstra, who fought against the \"goto\" and other common but bad constructs.[@dijksra:1972:goto] I still remember him, in an audience, giving us a lecture on good  techniques in programming at the International computing symposium 1977 in Liège.[@dijksra:1977:craft] It was a rather hard course because Dijkstra expected you to quickly  understand and implement his ideas.\n\nAnd then from '75 on, computers became cheaper and could be bought by departments and smaller entities. And than came the first interactive computer. They were still beasts, about two cubic meters, costing two millions belgian francs. But it was low (% CARLINSAYS: low?) enough to allow people to type in directly commands. I started working here in '75 as a researcher, it has evolved continuously and I saw computers getting cheaper and getting easier to use.The way to use it was simplified, you could start to go to the beast and try it out.\n\nI remember more or less: you wrote down the program in Fortran for instance. We always thought in the beginning that it would work and it didn't, so after a turn around you were giving it back to the operator and you have to wait another half a day or a night to get the results.\n\n% PP: What kind of program were you working on? \n% JH: I remember the first program I had to write was: you got three numbers and you had to make the program decide if you could construct a triangle with the numbers being the sides of the triangle.\n\n% PP: That took an afternoon to be processed?\n% JH: Well, yeah. You had to imagine how to do it which was also one problem, than you prepare the cards with the punching machine and you give the package of cards to the operator who was feeeding the computer with the cards. Operators were people who had the task of feeding the computers by hand, with paper, cards,(% CARLINSAYS: are these paper cards or paper and then cards because the two are separate?) then cards got written on disks and later processed by the mainframe from disk. Finally results got printed on paper. it lasts onto the magnetic disks period. And after a number of hours or a night you got a listing on a piece of paper with the results or program compilation errors.\n\n% PP: When where you able to record the program onto the machine?\n% JH: I think that happened between '75 and '80. After the punching cards, which were already a way to record the program, we had typewriters and then terminals. We could record the programs by typing it on the terminal  and the computer would store them on disk. We had magnetic discs. IBM had number for everything, I remember the 3300  [manufactured from 1970 on] was a magnetic disk. \nWe didn't touch the machines, operators would change the disks, we could only access the typewriter/terminal. That was our most direct connexion to the computer. The times were different. The mainframes were such huge costly beasts that it had operators day and night to keep it busy. Even at night there were two or three guys mounting tapes, disc mounting tapes, that kind of stuff.\nhttps://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/42/IBM_magnetic_disk_drives_3330%2B3333.png/600px-IBM_magnetic_disk_drives_3330%2B3333.png\n\n% PP: When did you stop working with operators?\n% JH: Somewhere between '85 and '90. There were still operators at the main computer of the university, but there were also small computers, so researchers and student could have direct access when needed. \n\n% PP: When did you start to work with software sold by others or given away in order to do your research?\n% JH: You still needed an operating system for the mainframe that was delivered by IBM or the constructor delivereding the mainframe (% CARLINSAYS: does this make sense with these changes?). When you bought mini-computers, which were the  smaller versions of mainframes, in most cases you bought an operating systems, compilers and all the stuff you needed to be able to program or work  those things. \nIn most cases,  the computer sciences department bought the mini-computer from, for instance *Digital Equipment Corporation*,  a manufactorer at that time, but they didn't buy DEC's  software. The DEC software  was not open source or free,  and as a university we could get Unix for free and could run it on those\n% digital equipment \nDEC computers. That is what the computer department of the University of Louvain la Neuve *l'unité d'informatique*, did and so did we.\n\n% PP: When did you start working with Unix as an OS? \n% JH: I took a trip to Amsterdam, it must have been in 1979 or 1980. Well, the story starts in our French sister university (LLN) where they had a PDP-11 with Unix on it. You could get Unix, at the time, when you were a university, from Bell Labs (part of AT&T), the American telephone company. AT&T was a mega organisation at the time [before the [dismantlment of AT&T/Bell system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breakup_of_the_Bell_System)]. Due to monopoly, the US authorities split it up into different Baby Bells. One of the restrictions was that the research Baby Bell, could not sell anything. There were computer scientists there who developed some interesting things (e.g. Unix). Universities got the source code for free, but NO support, nothing not even how to install it. In Unité d'informatique, where they had a [PDP-11/70](https://i0.wp.com/www.utterpower.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/pdp11-70-panel.jpg) they were lucky: they got the same computer that Unix was developed on.  They got the disk by snail mail as a post-office package. They mounted it and it did spin up and they had UNIX (% CARLINSAYS: is there a reason this is all capital letters?).\nHere, we had a cheaper PDP11, [the PDP 11/60](https://dave.cheney.net/tag/pdp-11). We got the Unix disk distribution from Bell Labs but we could not run it, because we got another type of disk(RK07). We could look at it but that was all, because our disc format was different than the one at Bell Labs. Somebody here (P.Verbaeten) wrote a driver for that disk in l'unité d'informatique of LLN. But they did not have a RK07.  It compiled it but we couldn't try it because we did not have (% CARLINSAYS: I think this should read \"It compiled it but we couldn't try it because we did not have a RKO7\"?). The nearest place with Unix and a RK07 was in Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam.  Andrew Tenenbaum, who wrote a number of books on operating systems, was working there. He was learning to speak Dutch. We understood hisEnglish better but his assistant explained that he needed to practice speaking Dutch because he would have to pass an exam. There we compiled Unix with an RK07 driver and stored it on a bootable RK07 disk. With that disk back in Leuven we could start Unix on our PDP11/60. An error in the process meant a trip Leuven-Amsterdam and back.\nIn my opinion the start of open source was Unix because we had to maintain it by ourselves and we learned a lot from the sources. \nIn that time for software distribution you had to store it on magnetic tape and send the tape to different places with associated problems. For example, the agents at the customs at the airport or post office didn't know what to do with the tapes or discs in terms of custom clearance. They used magnetic or x-rays as inspection tools and we had to write on the package that it should not be x-rayed. And sometimes we still got unreadable tapes/discs. \n\n% PP: So it took weeks between the transportation and the customs?\n% JH: Yes, the custom had to clear the packages. I remember I've been in the customs in Zaventem. I had received a letter that my package from Bell Labs had arrived. I went there thinking I would have to pay something and go. But no. It had to be cleared so there was some organisation that had to do administrative stuff, so I only got it a few days later. The response time was huge. (% CARLINSAYS: This \n\n% PP: Than after that period of time how did you switch from that kind of collaboration on how to make software and make software work to collaboration on networks, between universities and researchers...\n% JH: In the Unix systems at that time there was a kind of networking protocol which did work on serial lines (UUCP).\nTo connect two unix systems together you only need a serial line. We had a line between LLN and Leuven, it's only 25 kms, but we had to ask Belgacom, then La Régie des Télégraphes et Téléphones, to get a modem to connect through their network and than over that modem you could reach an amazing speed of 300 characters per second. And that was the first communication. It did happened somewhere around 85. And then you had connexion with another computer, writing something here and do the transfer to the other computer and execute it there. \n \n% PP: What was the first thing you did send through a network like this?\n% JH: I didn't do it myself, I remember it was a kind of chat program. On LLN side was Prof. Elie Milgrom, he is retired now. On this side, it was Prof.  Yves Willems. And I remember that they typed something and they got a response from the other side and that was it.  But I remember that Prof. Willems sent \"ok we stop now\". And that Elie Milgrom answered \"See you later, Alligator\" [a reference to Bill Haley and the Comets]. At the time we still had these kind of songs in mind. (lol). \nThose Unix to Unix connexions were first. And there was a worldwide Unix to Unix based network, Usenet (1979), it still exists somewhere... you can download load  of illegal movies and that stuff, that was not what we meant at the time. But that is what is left. And Usenet became gradually replaced by the Internet in USA. \nIn Europe, the Internet came a lot later, but we had limited access to the Internet by mail and even FTP; We could send mail to the Internet and we could receive mail from them, because Some friendly american university, later companies, did translate internet mail to UCP mail., moreover they did translate specially formatted mails into FTP request and send the result back to us by mail. That was before the 1990's.\n \n% PP: Your relation to software had changed at the time because you did not have to do all this manipulations with the software your received... Was it already floppy discs?\n% JH: No, magnetic tapes, for the mainframe at least. Even most of the mini-computers had some (cheaper) magnetic tapes. Between 90 and 95 the main machines used for  Unix software development was a VAX from DEC. Once a year the software came from Berkeley, it was still Unix but modified by Berkeley for virtual memory and all the stuff which are common now. We received a tape, with lot of goodies, I still remember we didn't know what was on the tape  but we did scrutinise it  to know what was on there, what we can use....\nIn Europe, companies like Siemens were trying to set up software centers to make software avaiable, they were even trying to set up European networks. But researchers did love the Internet, it worked, it was useful for their researchs. So companies in Europe, were trying to set up their own networks, I remember for example the X/OPEN transport protocol. Their was a lot of standards about what software layers should do, but it didn't succeed because around 1992 IBM decided to quit their own private network and to go forTCP/IP and was the switching point. \nEverything done for X/OPEN were suddently forgotten. For the mainframes, and certainly in Belgium computing was mainly mainframes, I'm talking about universities here, so when IBM decided to go for TCP/IP Univiversities did follow. \nBut the aceptation of TCP/IP was really slow. For example, Belgacom was not interested in running the Domain Name System so we did it here, for some time, starting in 1993 with [Pierre Verbaten](https://www.dnsbelgium.be/en/history). Belgacom were focused on X25 (DCS - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X.25) so they missed it.\n\n% PP: It was like the french Minitel?\n% JH: Well, at that time we were really jealous about Minitel. Could you imagine that? Terminals?  At home? You could work home with a computer! You could send emails! All in one, a pc computer with a modem! \n\n% PP: How did the research about software evolved in the department?\n% JH: I am mainly talking about network research but here. There were people working on numerical analysis, computing, artificial intelligence ... I was just not involved in those research so I don't know much about it \n\n% PP: You were focused on software and network..\n% JH: Yes, we did produce some software. We did make software to generate compilers, there was some A.I. software in Prolog, numerical analysis  libraries... Some were sold or shared, it depends.  \nWe did sell some software since the beginning I think when it was not even a department but a professor and a couple of students.\n\n% PP: Is it when you joined?\n% JH: No it was already a department. I did study first industrial engeneering in electronics. At the time in electronics you did hear something about computers, I was interested in it. I wanted to know more. I heard Kuleuvenhad started a\n% year before a\ndegree in computer engeneering. It was the first year where industrial engineers could join. The only thing we knew about computer were from movies. I wanted to know how it work. I'm not sure if I know now it now, but I have some ideas...\n\n% PP: How many language do you know?\n% JH: Assembly, FORTRAN, PL-1 the language invented by IBM to be the universal one, C, Cobol. Perl, I don't know, some  more. I'm not fluent in any computer language, but I can read any language especially well written, I know I can understand it and, if needed,  learn it... I know JAVA also. As a system administrator the thing I use most are the command line of UNIX and Perl. But that's because i'm more familiar with those two so it goes faster.\n\n% PP: How did you see the rise of personnal computer and the software that goes with?\n% JH: I have to admit that we missed it. We didn't see the new thing was powerful because available for everybody.  We were not impressed by the software. I remember windows 95, the news on TV, people sleeping on the street to get it. I remember when I get my first windows version, with a box of 22 floppies or so. Then I wanted to do something, to compile a program, but there was no compiler... We were used to Unix, a basic system but with a lot of utilities in it. Software was for us free, and we were used to have it free and on a pc it was not free anymore. \n\n% PP: Does that mean you didn't had a personnal computer until late?\n% JH: Yes. I think it was round 2000. I didn't needed it really. I got one when the belgian UUCP network became commercial. Of course I did not get Windows on it. I think we got Linux here in 1994. There was a guy involved in the kernel studying here. So we did used it very fast.\n\n% PP: So, what is software for you?\n% JH: For me software is the magic that make computer usable. I can only gives examples of what I mean by it. A PC without software most people, even computer scientists, can't do anything with it. You need basic software. Some software is already integrated in the computer hardware. Same for phones, tablets... The main characteristic, for me, is that it should be user friendly. That is very difficult I know, because you have to imagine what the people using your software are going to do with it and how they want to use it, that's the magic you need to solve.\n\n% PP: Is command line user friendly?\n% JH: Well, somehow you have to learn the Unix command language; it is in fact a computer language where you can make all the constructs that other languages offers.\nYou can create loops, you can test, whatever. It's not so different from computer languages like C or JAVA or whatever. It is certainly programmer friendly.\n\n% PP: But it's already software, no? User friendly depends on what you put behind these words, no?\n% JH: Yes it's already software. I don't have a strong opinion about command lines. It depends on people. I can imagine that someone that has never heard about the command line expects that you click somewhere and it happens. But if you know the command language it's sometimes perhaps easier or productive to type commands and let it run. Sometimes, I find it easier if I have a screen and a number of buttons and I don't have to imagine what happens behind that screen. And sometimes I want to do something with the command line, because I'm used to it. That's why I don't trust myself about user friendliness because I have a long experience in computer interfaces. I'm so used to some of them perhaps I can't even imagine that somebody else would like to do it otherwise or doesn't like what I'm used to.\n\n% PP: Apart from maintaining the museum, what do you work on? You are still active in the department even though you are retired?\n% JH: I work on sensors, in the internet of things world in one of the university spin-off. What I do for them is: wireless sensors need power, most  of them are on batteries. They have designed a complete system which should make the battery last for two, three, four years. They need a system to measure that. So I have been working on a mechanism to measure that without waiting four years. That's programming instrumentation computers to measure e.g. power or whatever. Most of it on Unix systems. \nThere are enough new or unknown things and maybe because I'm older, I have another way of looking at things, so we have a lot of discussions. They don't like my Perl, they use python, JAVA and those things... Perl, it has its disadvantage, but you can do a lot of things. Every  character has a meaning, that makes perl programs often unreadable.\nWith Python, you need all those libraries... It's easy when you know the libraries, what  you have to call. When you know the arguments of the librairies... so it's also complicated. And if the library changes for some reasons, there you go.\nIn my humble opinion it's the same with all the languages. It starts easy from scratch but if you have to interface them with existing things from the internet world or whatever it gets complicated.\n\n% PP: Do you have a last word?\n% JH: I was surprised by your group reaction to the visit. I thought all of this was known. Maybe I'm getting old :) Currently I don't do much about the museum department, but sometimes I like to talk about the little stories about it. I remember a lot of little stories, a lot of technics who have been used and forgotten and some kept alive. I thought when I was young that the best techniques would succeed. That you would have visionary people who would see the way. But I realized that a lot of things do happen by accident.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","attribs":"*7+a*7*3+p*7|1+1*g|1+1*f+2*7+1*f|1+2y*f+2v*g|1+1*6|1+1*h+6*5+1u*f*5+3*5+12*f*5+8*5+h*6|1+1*5+1j*f*5+7*5+2c*f*5+1*f+2*7+1*f+1o*5+1*6|1+1*h+6+9*f+1+1o*d+n+1y*f+1+18*f+1+10*d+1+3e*f+1+o*h+1+1t*h+1+1b*6|2+2+l*j+5+31*j+3+q*6|1+1|1+1*h+6*f*5+4*5+c*j*5+1*5+g*6|1+1*h+6+l*h+1+16*e+1+17*f+2+1a*j+30+4*f+2+1e*d+2+3a*h|1+2*h*e+2*e+k+1*h|1+1+1j*6|2+2+1h*f+5+d*j+1+4*j+1+10*7+1*0+k+44*7+1*0+l+2y*6|2+2+e*f+1+3r*j+b+b*j+1+24*j+m+27*f+1+p*d+1+q*f+1+d*d+1+3j*6|2+2+t*f+6+14*f+2+49*d+8+15*6|2+2*h+6*5+l*j*5+8*5+d*6|1+1*h+6+t*h+1+h*d+1+m*j+4+17*d+6+1y*6|2+2*h+6*5+13*6|1+1*h+6+2p*d+1+3f*d+8*j+8+5*j+4+b*j+5+3*d+1+1*j+3+y*j+1+7*j+28+1*j+b+2*d+1+2*d+l+9*d+2a+1*e+14+19*d+1+b*j+3+h*j+1+g*d+u+1*6|2+2*h+6*5+1n*6|1+1*h+6+c*d+1+6*f+2+9*f+1+7*f+1+s*d+1+8*f+3+1k*d+a+9*d+1+1*d+1+r*d+u+1*d+n+e*d*e+4*e+8+1c*h+1+g*d+1+2*d+1+s*d+4+h*d|1+1+2r*d+9+1l*0+1+g*j+2+2c*d+3+24*j+2+z*6|1+1+41*6|2+2*h+6*5+15*6|1+1*h+6+i*f+1+7*f+1+3s*d+4+x*6|2+2*h+6*5+1r*f*5+1*5+z*6|1+1*h+6+8*f+1+5*j+2+l*j+3+1v*j+2*e+3+e*j+1l+2s*j+6+1j*j+6+m*d+9+f*d|1+1+f*d+1+x*j+6+13*d+1+7*d+1+9*d+1+t*d+2+w*d+6+e*d+e+2*d+2+r*d+m+g*d+9+p*h|1+1*h*e+2*e+i*h|1+1+3q*6|2+2*h+6*5+w*j*5+1*5+a*j*5+2*5+2*6|1+1*h+6+1h*j+a+u*j+1+15*j+3+9*0+1+f*0+2+4*d+a+1g*d+n+7*j+1+r*d+2*h+1*d+1+3z*d+1+15*d+3+6*j+2+19*j+1+8*d+6+9*j+1+4*j+1+a*d+4+f*d+1+1c*j+2+4*d+1+j*d+c+2*j+1+c*j+3+b*j+5+1*d+h+7*d+11+p*0+i*h+1*0+9*h+2*0+2a*h+1+1e*j+1+5*d+2+3e*d+4*j+1r+1*6|1+1+9*j+3+g*0+1*h+2*0+d*h+1*0+11+1*0+38+2q*0+4+2*0+s*j+5*0+1m*0*e+s*e+3*j*e+1*e+2*j*e+8*e+1e*j+35*0+1+1*h+2*0+u*j+2*0+1i*h+1*0+a*j+5*0+2d*j+1*0+n*j+1*0+9b*d|1+1*d+1+1j*j+2*d+1+1y*0+1*d|1+1+d*d+t+1*j+3+4*d+5+1*d+2+1*d+l+1*d+c+k*d+p+13*d+1+n*j+7+x*d+9+1n*j+1+4*d+p+1q*h+1*d+p+c*d+6+7*0|2+2*h+6*5+17*j*5+5*5+a*j*5+2*0|1+1*h+6+1i*h+1+2f*0+4+10*h+1+25*j+1+1n*h+1+1l*j+m*0|2+2*h+6*5+5i*0|1+1*h+6+i*d+1+1*d+2+29*d+7+1*0|1+1*d+2+1f*d+7+d*d+6+z*d+1+11*d+1+1*2+e*d*2+1*2+e*d*2+1*2+b+83*d+1j+2*0|1+1+1*0|1+1*h+6*5+1u*0|1+1*h+6+n*h+1+15*d+1+f*d+5*7+1+1k*d+3+1*d+6+d*h+1+2u*h+1+h*7+3+5f*d|1+1+90*d|1+1+1h*d+8+m*d+o+m*d+b+10*e+9+1*d+1+2j*d+35+r*0|1+1+1*0|1+1*h+6*5+4n*0|1+1*h+6+1c*d+6+z*d+1+6*d+2+1h*d+5+5*d+5+9*d+c+5s*h+1+1a*d+6+8*d+4+b*d+3+i*d+3+n*d+3*0|1+1+3o*d+9+a*d+5+42*h+1+46*d+b+2o*d|1+1+3n*h+1+21*d+i+7*d+1+1*d|1+1*d+1a+3n*h+1+f*h+1+3m*0|2+2*h+6*5+v*0|1+1*h+6+5m*0|2+2*h+6*5+1q*0|1+1*h+6+1f*d+3+3o*h+1+q*0|2+2*h+6*5+16*0|1+1*h+6+5b*0|1+1+1a*h+1+2a*0|2+2*h+6*5+m*0|1+1*h+6+18*d+5+2z*h+1+l*h+1+1*h+1+u*d+8+d*h|1+1*h*e+2*e+d*h|1+1+27*d+1+1k*d+4+1h*d+4+9*d+e+i*0|2+2*h+6*5+d*h*5+1*5+g*0|1+1*h+6+w*h+1+1p*h+1+f*d+3+t*d+8+5*h+1+9*h+1+i*h+1+t*d+2+4*h+1*d+1+m*d+a*h+1*d+2+c*h+1+1h*d+2+3b*0|2+2*h+6*5+27*0|1+1*h+6+1f*d+2+4*d+6+c*d+y+3s*h+1+1x*h+1+21*d+2+3s*d+8+p*0|2+2*h+6*5+1q*0|1+1*h+6+2f*d+1+14*h+1+41*0|2+2*h+6*5+t*0|1+1*h+6+2i*h+1+3w*d+3+4l*h+1+4f*0|2+2*h+6*5+u*0|1+1*h+6+10*d+5+c*h+1+3*d+4+r*h+1+1l*h+1+c*0|1+1+2e*h+1+w*d+11*0|2+2*h+6*5+p*h*5+1*5+1u*0|1+1*h+6+3q*h+1+16*h+1+22*h+1+2k*h+1+j*h+1+17*h+1+1y*h+1+1h*h+1+q*h+1+1g*h+1+2c*h+1+2i*h+1+b*0|2+2*h+6*5+3f*0|1+1*h+6+2j*h+1+f*d+1+a*d+8+c*d+5+4m*d+6+3f*d+1+5*d+5+h*d+1+1*d+e+e*d|1+1+1l*h+1+a*h+1+3c*d+4*h+1+e*d+1+l*h+1+i*d+2+i*d+9+o*d|1+19+18*h+1+11*d+4*h+1*d+2+1v*h+1+r*h+1+n*d+1+w*d|1+1+1g*h+1+2f*d+1+1l*0|2+2*h+6*5+o*0|1+1*h+6+24*d+2+e*h+1+l*h+1+6*h+1+1m*h+1+4s*h+1+37*h+1+t*d+4+k*0|1+1*6|3+3*0|1+1*j|1+1|1+1"}}},"pad:observatory.guide.jeanhuensitvextended:revs:10301":{"changeset":"Z:fui>2|1d=778=b9*j+2$

HEADER: Interview with Jean Huens\n\n(% CARLINSAYS: Peggy can you fill in the when and where for this intro and add or change it as you see fit?)\nThe following is a transcript of an interview with Jean Huens conducted by Peggy at X date and Y place.\n\n% PP: You have been using computers since a long time, as you explained to us during the tour we had the joy of attending during the TGSO.\nI heard that until recently, let's say the late 1990s, that to learn computer programming you had to start by writing down the program on paper... (% CARLINSAYS: I want to put a period or a question mark here?) \n% JH: In 1973, I did study computer sciences, it was the second year of the Computer Sciense course, here in Leuven. At the time computers were mainframes and you did feed them with programs by punch cards. Programming was writing down the program, then you punched it and the next day you get results, mostly error. That's the way it worked at that time. To teach us programming, they used the language of that time, Fortran and some kind of invented assembly language, it didn't really exist, it was simplified.\n\nMost of the time you wrote down your program, the teacher and the assistant would have to tell you what is wrong or good, you didn't have much practical experience.\n\n% PP: What was it like, tons of pages? \n% JH: No. As an anecdocte, I remember punchcards were a block of papers, we were jealous of the people who came into the computer center with huge stacks of cards (% CARLINSAYS: The \"block of papers\" is a little confusing. Could we say \"punchcards came in huge stacks\"?). They were really small programs, not complicated one. In fact you had to learn to use the computer from scratch, everything was new, you couldn't rely on previous experiences.\n% , everything was new.\nAnd to start with small programs was difficult enough. \n\nThat was also the time when Edsger W. Dijkstra, who fought against the \"goto\" and other common but bad constructs.[@dijksra:1972:goto] I still remember him, in an audience, giving us a lecture on good  techniques in programming at the International computing symposium 1977 in Liège.[@dijksra:1977:craft] It was a rather hard course because Dijkstra expected you to quickly  understand and implement his ideas.\n\nAnd then from '75 on, computers became cheaper and could be bought by departments and smaller entities. And than came the first interactive computer. They were still beasts, about two cubic meters, costing two millions belgian francs. But it was low (% CARLINSAYS: low?) enough to allow people to type in directly commands. I started working here in '75 as a researcher, it has evolved continuously and I saw computers getting cheaper and getting easier to use.The way to use it was simplified, you could start to go to the beast and try it out.\n\nI remember more or less: you wrote down the program in Fortran for instance. We always thought in the beginning that it would work and it didn't, so after a turn around you were giving it back to the operator and you have to wait another half a day or a night to get the results.\n\n% PP: What kind of program were you working on? \n% JH: I remember the first program I had to write was: you got three numbers and you had to make the program decide if you could construct a triangle with the numbers being the sides of the triangle.\n\n% PP: That took an afternoon to be processed?\n% JH: Well, yeah. You had to imagine how to do it which was also one problem, than you prepare the cards with the punching machine and you give the package of cards to the operator who was feeeding the computer with the cards. Operators were people who had the task of feeding the computers by hand, with paper, cards,(% CARLINSAYS: are these paper cards or paper and then cards because the two are separate?) then cards got written on disks and later processed by the mainframe from disk. Finally results got printed on paper. it lasts onto the magnetic disks period. And after a number of hours or a night you got a listing on a piece of paper with the results or program compilation errors.\n\n% PP: When where you able to record the program onto the machine?\n% JH: I think that happened between '75 and '80. After the punching cards, which were already a way to record the program, we had typewriters and then terminals. We could record the programs by typing it on the terminal  and the computer would store them on disk. We had magnetic discs. IBM had number for everything, I remember the 3300  [manufactured from 1970 on] was a magnetic disk. \nWe didn't touch the machines, operators would change the disks, we could only access the typewriter/terminal. That was our most direct connexion to the computer. The times were different. The mainframes were such huge costly beasts that it had operators day and night to keep it busy. Even at night there were two or three guys mounting tapes, disc mounting tapes, that kind of stuff.\nhttps://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/42/IBM_magnetic_disk_drives_3330%2B3333.png/600px-IBM_magnetic_disk_drives_3330%2B3333.png\n\n% PP: When did you stop working with operators?\n% JH: Somewhere between '85 and '90. There were still operators at the main computer of the university, but there were also small computers, so researchers and student could have direct access when needed. \n\n% PP: When did you start to work with software sold by others or given away in order to do your research?\n% JH: You still needed an operating system for the mainframe that was delivered by IBM or the constructor delivereding the mainframe (% CARLINSAYS: does this make sense with these changes?). When you bought mini-computers, which were the  smaller versions of mainframes, in most cases you bought an operating systems, compilers and all the stuff you needed to be able to program or work  those things. \nIn most cases,  the computer sciences department bought the mini-computer from, for instance *Digital Equipment Corporation*,  a manufactorer at that time, but they didn't buy DEC's  software. The DEC software  was not open source or free,  and as a university we could get Unix for free and could run it on those\n% digital equipment \nDEC computers. That is what the computer department of the University of Louvain la Neuve *l'unité d'informatique*, did and so did we.\n\n% PP: When did you start working with Unix as an OS? \n% JH: I took a trip to Amsterdam, it must have been in 1979 or 1980. Well, the story starts in our French sister university (LLN) where they had a PDP-11 with Unix on it. You could get Unix, at the time, when you were a university, from Bell Labs (part of AT&T), the American telephone company. AT&T was a mega organisation at the time [before the [dismantlment of AT&T/Bell system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breakup_of_the_Bell_System)]. Due to monopoly, the US authorities split it up into different Baby Bells. One of the restrictions was that the research Baby Bell, could not sell anything. There were computer scientists there who developed some interesting things (e.g. Unix). Universities got the source code for free, but NO support, nothing not even how to install it. In Unité d'informatique, where they had a [PDP-11/70](https://i0.wp.com/www.utterpower.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/pdp11-70-panel.jpg) they were lucky: they got the same computer that Unix was developed on.  They got the disk by snail mail as a post-office package. They mounted it and it did spin up and they had UNIX (% CARLINSAYS: is there a reason this is all capital letters?).\nHere, we had a cheaper PDP11, [the PDP 11/60](https://dave.cheney.net/tag/pdp-11). We got the Unix disk distribution from Bell Labs but we could not run it, because we got another type of disk(RK07). We could look at it but that was all, because our disc format was different than the one at Bell Labs. Somebody here (P.Verbaeten) wrote a driver for that disk in l'unité d'informatique of LLN. But they did not have a RK07.  It compiled it but we couldn't try it because we did not have (% CARLINSAYS: I think this should read \"It compiled it but we couldn't try it because we did not have a RKO7\"?). The nearest place with Unix and a RK07 was in Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam.  Andrew Tenenbaum, who wrote a number of books on operating systems, was working there. He was learning to speak Dutch. We understood hisEnglish better but his assistant explained that he needed to practice speaking Dutch because he would have to pass an exam. There we compiled Unix with an RK07 driver and stored it on a bootable RK07 disk. With that disk back in Leuven we could start Unix on our PDP11/60. An error in the process meant a trip Leuven-Amsterdam and back.\nIn my opinion the start of open source was Unix because we had to maintain it by ourselves and we learned a lot from the sources. \nIn that time for software distribution you had to store it on magnetic tape and send the tape to different places with associated problems. For example, the agents at the customs at the airport or post office didn't know what to do with the tapes or discs in terms of custom clearance. They used magnetic or x-rays as inspection tools and we had to write on the package that it should not be x-rayed. And sometimes we still got unreadable tapes/discs. \n\n% PP: So it took weeks between the transportation and the customs?\n% JH: Yes, the custom had to clear the packages. I remember I've been in the customs in Zaventem. I had received a letter that my package from Bell Labs had arrived. I went there thinking I would have to pay something and go. But no. It had to be cleared so there was some organisation that had to do administrative stuff, so I only got it a few days later. The response time was huge. (% CARLINSAYS: This is a nice idiosyncratic pharse so maybe we leave it even if it is a bit hard to understand? I think it means it took a long time for things to be shipped back and forth) \n\n% PP: After that period of time, how did you switch from that kind of collaboration on how to make software and make software work, to another kind of collaboration on networks and between universities and researchers?\n% JH: In the Unix systems at that time there was a kind of networking protocol which did work on serial lines (UUCP).\nTo connect two unix systems together you only need a serial line. We had a line between LLN and Leuven, it's only 25 kms, but we had to ask Belgacom, then La Régie des Télégraphes et Téléphones, to get a modem to connect through their network and than over that modem you could reach an amazing speed of 300 characters per second. And that was the first communication. It did happened somewhere around 85. And then you had connexion with another computer, writing something here and do the transfer to the other computer and execute it there. \n \n% PP: What was the first thing you did send through a network like this?\n% JH: I didn't do it myself, I remember it was a kind of chat program. On LLN side was Prof. Elie Milgrom, he is retired now. On this side, it was Prof.  Yves Willems. And I remember that they typed something and they got a response from the other side and that was it.  But I remember that Prof. Willems sent \"ok we stop now\". And that Elie Milgrom answered \"See you later, Alligator\" [a reference to Bill Haley and the Comets]. At the time we still had these kind of songs in mind. (lol). \nThose Unix to Unix connexions were first. And there was a worldwide Unix to Unix based network, Usenet (1979), it still exists somewhere... you can download load  of illegal movies and that stuff, that was not what we meant at the time. But that is what is left. And Usenet became gradually replaced by the Internet in USA. \nIn Europe, the Internet came a lot later, but we had limited access to the Internet by mail and even FTP; We could send mail to the Internet and we could receive mail from them, because Some friendly american university, later companies, did translate internet mail to UCP mail., moreover they did translate specially formatted mails into FTP request and send the result back to us by mail. That was before the 1990's.\n \n% PP: Your relation to software had changed at the time because you did not have to do all this manipulations with the software your received... Was it already floppy discs?\n% JH: No, magnetic tapes, for the mainframe at least. Even most of the mini-computers had some (cheaper) magnetic tapes. Between 90 and 95 the main machines used for  Unix software development was a VAX from DEC. Once a year the software came from Berkeley, it was still Unix but modified by Berkeley for virtual memory and all the stuff which are common now. We received a tape, with lot of goodies, I still remember we didn't know what was on the tape  but we did scrutinise it  to know what was on there, what we can use....\nIn Europe, companies like Siemens were trying to set up software centers to make software avaiable, they were even trying to set up European networks. But researchers did love the Internet, it worked, it was useful for their researchs. So companies in Europe, were trying to set up their own networks, I remember for example the X/OPEN transport protocol. Their was a lot of standards about what software layers should do, but it didn't succeed because around 1992 IBM decided to quit their own private network and to go forTCP/IP and was the switching point. \nEverything done for X/OPEN were suddently forgotten. For the mainframes, and certainly in Belgium computing was mainly mainframes, I'm talking about universities here, so when IBM decided to go for TCP/IP Univiversities did follow. \nBut the aceptation of TCP/IP was really slow. For example, Belgacom was not interested in running the Domain Name System so we did it here, for some time, starting in 1993 with [Pierre Verbaten](https://www.dnsbelgium.be/en/history). Belgacom were focused on X25 (DCS - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X.25) so they missed it.\n\n% PP: It was like the french Minitel?\n% JH: Well, at that time we were really jealous about Minitel. Could you imagine that? Terminals?  At home? You could work home with a computer! You could send emails! All in one, a pc computer with a modem! \n\n% PP: How did the research about software evolved in the department?\n% JH: I am mainly talking about network research but here. There were people working on numerical analysis, computing, artificial intelligence ... I was just not involved in those research so I don't know much about it \n\n% PP: You were focused on software and network..\n% JH: Yes, we did produce some software. We did make software to generate compilers, there was some A.I. software in Prolog, numerical analysis  libraries... Some were sold or shared, it depends.  \nWe did sell some software since the beginning I think when it was not even a department but a professor and a couple of students.\n\n% PP: Is it when you joined?\n% JH: No it was already a department. I did study first industrial engeneering in electronics. At the time in electronics you did hear something about computers, I was interested in it. I wanted to know more. I heard Kuleuvenhad started a\n% year before a\ndegree in computer engeneering. It was the first year where industrial engineers could join. The only thing we knew about computer were from movies. I wanted to know how it work. I'm not sure if I know now it now, but I have some ideas...\n\n% PP: How many language do you know?\n% JH: Assembly, FORTRAN, PL-1 the language invented by IBM to be the universal one, C, Cobol. Perl, I don't know, some  more. I'm not fluent in any computer language, but I can read any language especially well written, I know I can understand it and, if needed,  learn it... I know JAVA also. As a system administrator the thing I use most are the command line of UNIX and Perl. But that's because i'm more familiar with those two so it goes faster.\n\n% PP: How did you see the rise of personnal computer and the software that goes with?\n% JH: I have to admit that we missed it. We didn't see the new thing was powerful because available for everybody.  We were not impressed by the software. I remember windows 95, the news on TV, people sleeping on the street to get it. I remember when I get my first windows version, with a box of 22 floppies or so. Then I wanted to do something, to compile a program, but there was no compiler... We were used to Unix, a basic system but with a lot of utilities in it. Software was for us free, and we were used to have it free and on a pc it was not free anymore. \n\n% PP: Does that mean you didn't had a personnal computer until late?\n% JH: Yes. I think it was round 2000. I didn't needed it really. I got one when the belgian UUCP network became commercial. Of course I did not get Windows on it. I think we got Linux here in 1994. There was a guy involved in the kernel studying here. So we did used it very fast.\n\n% PP: So, what is software for you?\n% JH: For me software is the magic that make computer usable. I can only gives examples of what I mean by it. A PC without software most people, even computer scientists, can't do anything with it. You need basic software. Some software is already integrated in the computer hardware. Same for phones, tablets... The main characteristic, for me, is that it should be user friendly. That is very difficult I know, because you have to imagine what the people using your software are going to do with it and how they want to use it, that's the magic you need to solve.\n\n% PP: Is command line user friendly?\n% JH: Well, somehow you have to learn the Unix command language; it is in fact a computer language where you can make all the constructs that other languages offers.\nYou can create loops, you can test, whatever. It's not so different from computer languages like C or JAVA or whatever. It is certainly programmer friendly.\n\n% PP: But it's already software, no? User friendly depends on what you put behind these words, no?\n% JH: Yes it's already software. I don't have a strong opinion about command lines. It depends on people. I can imagine that someone that has never heard about the command line expects that you click somewhere and it happens. But if you know the command language it's sometimes perhaps easier or productive to type commands and let it run. Sometimes, I find it easier if I have a screen and a number of buttons and I don't have to imagine what happens behind that screen. And sometimes I want to do something with the command line, because I'm used to it. That's why I don't trust myself about user friendliness because I have a long experience in computer interfaces. I'm so used to some of them perhaps I can't even imagine that somebody else would like to do it otherwise or doesn't like what I'm used to.\n\n% PP: Apart from maintaining the museum, what do you work on? You are still active in the department even though you are retired?\n% JH: I work on sensors, in the internet of things world in one of the university spin-off. What I do for them is: wireless sensors need power, most  of them are on batteries. They have designed a complete system which should make the battery last for two, three, four years. They need a system to measure that. So I have been working on a mechanism to measure that without waiting four years. That's programming instrumentation computers to measure e.g. power or whatever. Most of it on Unix systems. \nThere are enough new or unknown things and maybe because I'm older, I have another way of looking at things, so we have a lot of discussions. They don't like my Perl, they use python, JAVA and those things... Perl, it has its disadvantage, but you can do a lot of things. Every  character has a meaning, that makes perl programs often unreadable.\nWith Python, you need all those libraries... It's easy when you know the libraries, what  you have to call. When you know the arguments of the librairies... so it's also complicated. And if the library changes for some reasons, there you go.\nIn my humble opinion it's the same with all the languages. It starts easy from scratch but if you have to interface them with existing things from the internet world or whatever it gets complicated.\n\n% PP: Do you have a last word?\n% JH: I was surprised by your group reaction to the visit. I thought all of this was known. Maybe I'm getting old :) Currently I don't do much about the museum department, but sometimes I like to talk about the little stories about it. I remember a lot of little stories, a lot of technics who have been used and forgotten and some kept alive. I thought when I was young that the best techniques would succeed.

HEADER: Interview with Jean Huens\n\n(% CARLINSAYS: Peggy can you fill in the when and where for this intro and add or change it as you see fit?)\nThe following is a transcript of an interview with Jean Huens conducted by Peggy at X date and Y place.\n\n% PP: You have been using computers since a long time, as you explained to us during the tour we had the joy of attending during the TGSO.\nI heard that until recently, let's say the late 1990s, that to learn computer programming you had to start by writing down the program on paper... (% CARLINSAYS: I want to put a period or a question mark here?) \n% JH: In 1973, I did study computer sciences, it was the second year of the Computer Sciense course, here in Leuven. At the time computers were mainframes and you did feed them with programs by punch cards. Programming was writing down the program, then you punched it and the next day you get results, mostly error. That's the way it worked at that time. To teach us programming, they used the language of that time, Fortran and some kind of invented assembly language, it didn't really exist, it was simplified.\n\nMost of the time you wrote down your program, the teacher and the assistant would have to tell you what is wrong or good, you didn't have much practical experience.\n\n% PP: What was it like, tons of pages? \n% JH: No. As an anecdocte, I remember punchcards were a block of papers, we were jealous of the people who came into the computer center with huge stacks of cards (% CARLINSAYS: The \"block of papers\" is a little confusing. Could we say \"punchcards came in huge stacks\"?). They were really small programs, not complicated one. In fact you had to learn to use the computer from scratch, everything was new, you couldn't rely on previous experiences.\n% , everything was new.\nAnd to start with small programs was difficult enough. \n\nThat was also the time when Edsger W. Dijkstra, who fought against the \"goto\" and other common but bad constructs.[@dijksra:1972:goto] I still remember him, in an audience, giving us a lecture on good  techniques in programming at the International computing symposium 1977 in Liège.[@dijksra:1977:craft] It was a rather hard course because Dijkstra expected you to quickly  understand and implement his ideas.\n\nAnd then from '75 on, computers became cheaper and could be bought by departments and smaller entities. And than came the first interactive computer. They were still beasts, about two cubic meters, costing two millions belgian francs. But it was low (% CARLINSAYS: low?) enough to allow people to type in directly commands. I started working here in '75 as a researcher, it has evolved continuously and I saw computers getting cheaper and getting easier to use.The way to use it was simplified, you could start to go to the beast and try it out.\n\nI remember more or less: you wrote down the program in Fortran for instance. We always thought in the beginning that it would work and it didn't, so after a turn around you were giving it back to the operator and you have to wait another half a day or a night to get the results.\n\n% PP: What kind of program were you working on? \n% JH: I remember the first program I had to write was: you got three numbers and you had to make the program decide if you could construct a triangle with the numbers being the sides of the triangle.\n\n% PP: That took an afternoon to be processed?\n% JH: Well, yeah. You had to imagine how to do it which was also one problem, than you prepare the cards with the punching machine and you give the package of cards to the operator who was feeeding the computer with the cards. Operators were people who had the task of feeding the computers by hand, with paper, cards,(% CARLINSAYS: are these paper cards or paper and then cards because the two are separate?) then cards got written on disks and later processed by the mainframe from disk. Finally results got printed on paper. it lasts onto the magnetic disks period. And after a number of hours or a night you got a listing on a piece of paper with the results or program compilation errors.\n\n% PP: When where you able to record the program onto the machine?\n% JH: I think that happened between '75 and '80. After the punching cards, which were already a way to record the program, we had typewriters and then terminals. We could record the programs by typing it on the terminal  and the computer would store them on disk. We had magnetic discs. IBM had number for everything, I remember the 3300  [manufactured from 1970 on] was a magnetic disk. \nWe didn't touch the machines, operators would change the disks, we could only access the typewriter/terminal. That was our most direct connexion to the computer. The times were different. The mainframes were such huge costly beasts that it had operators day and night to keep it busy. Even at night there were two or three guys mounting tapes, disc mounting tapes, that kind of stuff.\nhttps://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/42/IBM_magnetic_disk_drives_3330%2B3333.png/600px-IBM_magnetic_disk_drives_3330%2B3333.png\n\n% PP: When did you stop working with operators?\n% JH: Somewhere between '85 and '90. There were still operators at the main computer of the university, but there were also small computers, so researchers and student could have direct access when needed. \n\n% PP: When did you start to work with software sold by others or given away in order to do your research?\n% JH: You still needed an operating system for the mainframe that was delivered by IBM or the constructor delivereding the mainframe (% CARLINSAYS: does this make sense with these changes?). When you bought mini-computers, which were the  smaller versions of mainframes, in most cases you bought an operating systems, compilers and all the stuff you needed to be able to program or work  those things. \nIn most cases,  the computer sciences department bought the mini-computer from, for instance *Digital Equipment Corporation*,  a manufactorer at that time, but they didn't buy DEC's  software. The DEC software  was not open source or free,  and as a university we could get Unix for free and could run it on those\n% digital equipment \nDEC computers. That is what the computer department of the University of Louvain la Neuve *l'unité d'informatique*, did and so did we.\n\n% PP: When did you start working with Unix as an OS? \n% JH: I took a trip to Amsterdam, it must have been in 1979 or 1980. Well, the story starts in our French sister university (LLN) where they had a PDP-11 with Unix on it. You could get Unix, at the time, when you were a university, from Bell Labs (part of AT&T), the American telephone company. AT&T was a mega organisation at the time [before the [dismantlment of AT&T/Bell system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breakup_of_the_Bell_System)]. Due to monopoly, the US authorities split it up into different Baby Bells. One of the restrictions was that the research Baby Bell, could not sell anything. There were computer scientists there who developed some interesting things (e.g. Unix). Universities got the source code for free, but NO support, nothing not even how to install it. In Unité d'informatique, where they had a [PDP-11/70](https://i0.wp.com/www.utterpower.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/pdp11-70-panel.jpg) they were lucky: they got the same computer that Unix was developed on.  They got the disk by snail mail as a post-office package. They mounted it and it did spin up and they had UNIX (% CARLINSAYS: is there a reason this is all capital letters?).\nHere, we had a cheaper PDP11, [the PDP 11/60](https://dave.cheney.net/tag/pdp-11). We got the Unix disk distribution from Bell Labs but we could not run it, because we got another type of disk(RK07). We could look at it but that was all, because our disc format was different than the one at Bell Labs. Somebody here (P.Verbaeten) wrote a driver for that disk in l'unité d'informatique of LLN. But they did not have a RK07.  It compiled it but we couldn't try it because we did not have (% CARLINSAYS: I think this should read \"It compiled it but we couldn't try it because we did not have a RKO7\"?). The nearest place with Unix and a RK07 was in Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam.  Andrew Tenenbaum, who wrote a number of books on operating systems, was working there. He was learning to speak Dutch. We understood hisEnglish better but his assistant explained that he needed to practice speaking Dutch because he would have to pass an exam. There we compiled Unix with an RK07 driver and stored it on a bootable RK07 disk. With that disk back in Leuven we could start Unix on our PDP11/60. An error in the process meant a trip Leuven-Amsterdam and back.\nIn my opinion the start of open source was Unix because we had to maintain it by ourselves and we learned a lot from the sources. \nIn that time for software distribution you had to store it on magnetic tape and send the tape to different places with associated problems. For example, the agents at the customs at the airport or post office didn't know what to do with the tapes or discs in terms of custom clearance. They used magnetic or x-rays as inspection tools and we had to write on the package that it should not be x-rayed. And sometimes we still got unreadable tapes/discs. \n\n% PP: So it took weeks between the transportation and the customs?\n% JH: Yes, the custom had to clear the packages. I remember I've been in the customs in Zaventem. I had received a letter that my package from Bell Labs had arrived. I went there thinking I would have to pay something and go. But no. It had to be cleared so there was some organisation that had to do administrative stuff, so I only got it a few days later. The response time was huge. (% CARLINSAYS: This is a nice idiosyncratic pharse so maybe we leave it even if it is a bit hard to understand? I think it means it took a long time for things to be shipped back and forth) \n\n% PP: After that period of time, how did you switch from that kind of collaboration on how to make software and make software work, to another kind of collaboration on networks and between universities and researchers?\n% JH: In the Unix systems at that time there was a kind of networking protocol which worked on serial lines (UUCP).\nTo connect two Unix systems together you only need a serial line. We had a line between LLN and Leuven, it's only 25 kms, but we had to ask Belgacom, then La Régie des Télégraphes et Téléphones, to get a modem to connect through their network and than over that modem you could reach an amazing speed of 300 characters per second. And that was the first communication. It happened somewhere around 1985. And then you had connection with another computer by writing something here and doing the transfer to the other computer and executing it there. \n \n% PP: What was the first thing you sent through a network like this?\n% JH: I didn't do it myself, I remember it was a kind of chat program. On the LLN side was Professor Elie Milgrom. He is retired now. On this side, it was Professor  Yves Willems. And I remember that they typed something and they got a response from the other side and that was it.  But I remember that Professor Willems sent \"Ok, we stop now.\" And that Elie Milgrom answered \"See you later, Alligator\" [a reference to Bill Haley and the Comets]. At the time we still had these kind of songs in mind. (lol). \nThose Unix to Unix connexions were first. And there was a worldwide Unix to Unix based network, Usenet (1979). It still exists somewhere.You can download loads of illegal movies and that stuff. That was not what we meant at the time. But that is what is left. And Usenet became gradually replaced by the Internet in USA. \nIn Europe, the Internet came a lot later, but we had limited access to the Internet by mail and even FTP; We could send mail to the Internet and we could receive mail from them because some friendly American university (and later companies) di translated internet mail to UCP mail., moreover they did translate specially formatted mails into FTP request and send the result back to us by mail. That was before the 1990's.\n \n% PP: Your relation to software had changed at the time because you did not have to do all this manipulations with the software your received... Was it already floppy discs?\n% JH: No, magnetic tapes, for the mainframe at least. Even most of the mini-computers had some (cheaper) magnetic tapes. Between 90 and 95 the main machines used for  Unix software development was a VAX from DEC. Once a year the software came from Berkeley, it was still Unix but modified by Berkeley for virtual memory and all the stuff which are common now. We received a tape, with lot of goodies, I still remember we didn't know what was on the tape  but we did scrutinise it  to know what was on there, what we can use....\nIn Europe, companies like Siemens were trying to set up software centers to make software avaiable, they were even trying to set up European networks. But researchers did love the Internet, it worked, it was useful for their researchs. So companies in Europe, were trying to set up their own networks, I remember for example the X/OPEN transport protocol. Their was a lot of standards about what software layers should do, but it didn't succeed because around 1992 IBM decided to quit their own private network and to go forTCP/IP and was the switching point. \nEverything done for X/OPEN were suddently forgotten. For the mainframes, and certainly in Belgium computing was mainly mainframes, I'm talking about universities here, so when IBM decided to go for TCP/IP Univiversities did follow. \nBut the aceptation of TCP/IP was really slow. For example, Belgacom was not interested in running the Domain Name System so we did it here, for some time, starting in 1993 with [Pierre Verbaten](https://www.dnsbelgium.be/en/history). Belgacom were focused on X25 (DCS - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X.25) so they missed it.\n\n% PP: It was like the french Minitel?\n% JH: Well, at that time we were really jealous about Minitel. Could you imagine that? Terminals?  At home? You could work home with a computer! You could send emails! All in one, a pc computer with a modem! \n\n% PP: How did the research about software evolved in the department?\n% JH: I am mainly talking about network research but here. There were people working on numerical analysis, computing, artificial intelligence ... I was just not involved in those research so I don't know much about it \n\n% PP: You were focused on software and network..\n% JH: Yes, we did produce some software. We did make software to generate compilers, there was some A.I. software in Prolog, numerical analysis  libraries... Some were sold or shared, it depends.  \nWe did sell some software since the beginning I think when it was not even a department but a professor and a couple of students.\n\n% PP: Is it when you joined?\n% JH: No it was already a department. I did study first industrial engeneering in electronics. At the time in electronics you did hear something about computers, I was interested in it. I wanted to know more. I heard Kuleuvenhad started a\n% year before a\ndegree in computer engeneering. It was the first year where industrial engineers could join. The only thing we knew about computer were from movies. I wanted to know how it work. I'm not sure if I know now it now, but I have some ideas...\n\n% PP: How many language do you know?\n% JH: Assembly, FORTRAN, PL-1 the language invented by IBM to be the universal one, C, Cobol. Perl, I don't know, some  more. I'm not fluent in any computer language, but I can read any language especially well written, I know I can understand it and, if needed,  learn it... I know JAVA also. As a system administrator the thing I use most are the command line of UNIX and Perl. But that's because i'm more familiar with those two so it goes faster.\n\n% PP: How did you see the rise of personnal computer and the software that goes with?\n% JH: I have to admit that we missed it. We didn't see the new thing was powerful because available for everybody.  We were not impressed by the software. I remember windows 95, the news on TV, people sleeping on the street to get it. I remember when I get my first windows version, with a box of 22 floppies or so. Then I wanted to do something, to compile a program, but there was no compiler... We were used to Unix, a basic system but with a lot of utilities in it. Software was for us free, and we were used to have it free and on a pc it was not free anymore. \n\n% PP: Does that mean you didn't had a personnal computer until late?\n% JH: Yes. I think it was round 2000. I didn't needed it really. I got one when the belgian UUCP network became commercial. Of course I did not get Windows on it. I think we got Linux here in 1994. There was a guy involved in the kernel studying here. So we did used it very fast.\n\n% PP: So, what is software for you?\n% JH: For me software is the magic that make computer usable. I can only gives examples of what I mean by it. A PC without software most people, even computer scientists, can't do anything with it. You need basic software. Some software is already integrated in the computer hardware. Same for phones, tablets... The main characteristic, for me, is that it should be user friendly. That is very difficult I know, because you have to imagine what the people using your software are going to do with it and how they want to use it, that's the magic you need to solve.\n\n% PP: Is command line user friendly?\n% JH: Well, somehow you have to learn the Unix command language; it is in fact a computer language where you can make all the constructs that other languages offers.\nYou can create loops, you can test, whatever. It's not so different from computer languages like C or JAVA or whatever. It is certainly programmer friendly.\n\n% PP: But it's already software, no? User friendly depends on what you put behind these words, no?\n% JH: Yes it's already software. I don't have a strong opinion about command lines. It depends on people. I can imagine that someone that has never heard about the command line expects that you click somewhere and it happens. But if you know the command language it's sometimes perhaps easier or productive to type commands and let it run. Sometimes, I find it easier if I have a screen and a number of buttons and I don't have to imagine what happens behind that screen. And sometimes I want to do something with the command line, because I'm used to it. That's why I don't trust myself about user friendliness because I have a long experience in computer interfaces. I'm so used to some of them perhaps I can't even imagine that somebody else would like to do it otherwise or doesn't like what I'm used to.\n\n% PP: Apart from maintaining the museum, what do you work on? You are still active in the department even though you are retired?\n% JH: I work on sensors, in the internet of things world in one of the university spin-off. What I do for them is: wireless sensors need power, most  of them are on batteries. They have designed a complete system which should make the battery last for two, three, four years. They need a system to measure that. So I have been working on a mechanism to measure that without waiting four years. That's programming instrumentation computers to measure e.g. power or whatever. Most of it on Unix systems. \nThere are enough new or unknown things and maybe because I'm older, I have another way of looking at things, so we have a lot of discussions. They don't like my Perl, they use python, JAVA and those things... Perl, it has its disadvantage, but you can do a lot of things. Every  character has a meaning, that makes perl programs often unreadable.\nWith Python, you need all those libraries... It's easy when you know the libraries, what  you have to call. When you know the arguments of the librairies... so it's also complicated. And if the library changes for some reasons, there you go.\nIn my humble opinion it's the same with all the languages. It starts easy from scratch but if you have to interface them with existing things from the internet world or whatever it gets complicated.\n\n% PP: Do you have a last word?\n% JH: I was surprised by your group reaction to the visit. I thought all of this was known. Maybe I'm getting old :) Currently I don't do much about the museum department, but sometimes I like to talk about the little stories about it. I remember a lot of little stories, a lot of technics who have been used and forgotten and some kept alive. I thought when I was young that the best techniques would succeed. That you would have visionary people who would see the way.

HEADER: Interview with Jean Huens\n\n(% CARLINSAYS: Peggy can you fill in the when and where for this intro and add or change it as you see fit?)\nThe following is a transcript of an interview with Jean Huens conducted by Peggy at X date and Y place.\n\n% PP: You have been using computers since a long time, as you explained to us during the tour we had the joy of attending during the TGSO.\nI heard that until recently, let's say the late 1990s, that to learn computer programming you had to start by writing down the program on paper... (% CARLINSAYS: I want to put a period or a question mark here?) \n% JH: In 1973, I did study computer sciences, it was the second year of the Computer Sciense course, here in Leuven. At the time computers were mainframes and you did feed them with programs by punch cards. Programming was writing down the program, then you punched it and the next day you get results, mostly error. That's the way it worked at that time. To teach us programming, they used the language of that time, Fortran and some kind of invented assembly language, it didn't really exist, it was simplified.\n\nMost of the time you wrote down your program, the teacher and the assistant would have to tell you what is wrong or good, you didn't have much practical experience.\n\n% PP: What was it like, tons of pages? \n% JH: No. As an anecdocte, I remember punchcards were a block of papers, we were jealous of the people who came into the computer center with huge stacks of cards (% CARLINSAYS: The \"block of papers\" is a little confusing. Could we say \"punchcards came in huge stacks\"?). They were really small programs, not complicated one. In fact you had to learn to use the computer from scratch, everything was new, you couldn't rely on previous experiences.\n% , everything was new.\nAnd to start with small programs was difficult enough. \n\nThat was also the time when Edsger W. Dijkstra, who fought against the \"goto\" and other common but bad constructs.[@dijksra:1972:goto] I still remember him, in an audience, giving us a lecture on good  techniques in programming at the International computing symposium 1977 in Liège.[@dijksra:1977:craft] It was a rather hard course because Dijkstra expected you to quickly  understand and implement his ideas.\n\nAnd then from '75 on, computers became cheaper and could be bought by departments and smaller entities. And than came the first interactive computer. They were still beasts, about two cubic meters, costing two millions belgian francs. But it was low (% CARLINSAYS: low?) enough to allow people to type in directly commands. I started working here in '75 as a researcher, it has evolved continuously and I saw computers getting cheaper and getting easier to use.The way to use it was simplified, you could start to go to the beast and try it out.\n\nI remember more or less: you wrote down the program in Fortran for instance. We always thought in the beginning that it would work and it didn't, so after a turn around you were giving it back to the operator and you have to wait another half a day or a night to get the results.\n\n% PP: What kind of program were you working on? \n% JH: I remember the first program I had to write was: you got three numbers and you had to make the program decide if you could construct a triangle with the numbers being the sides of the triangle.\n\n% PP: That took an afternoon to be processed?\n% JH: Well, yeah. You had to imagine how to do it which was also one problem, than you prepare the cards with the punching machine and you give the package of cards to the operator who was feeeding the computer with the cards. Operators were people who had the task of feeding the computers by hand, with paper, cards,(% CARLINSAYS: are these paper cards or paper and then cards because the two are separate?) then cards got written on disks and later processed by the mainframe from disk. Finally results got printed on paper. it lasts onto the magnetic disks period. And after a number of hours or a night you got a listing on a piece of paper with the results or program compilation errors.\n\n% PP: When where you able to record the program onto the machine?\n% JH: I think that happened between '75 and '80. After the punching cards, which were already a way to record the program, we had typewriters and then terminals. We could record the programs by typing it on the terminal  and the computer would store them on disk. We had magnetic discs. IBM had number for everything, I remember the 3300  [manufactured from 1970 on] was a magnetic disk. \nWe didn't touch the machines, operators would change the disks, we could only access the typewriter/terminal. That was our most direct connexion to the computer. The times were different. The mainframes were such huge costly beasts that it had operators day and night to keep it busy. Even at night there were two or three guys mounting tapes, disc mounting tapes, that kind of stuff.\nhttps://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/42/IBM_magnetic_disk_drives_3330%2B3333.png/600px-IBM_magnetic_disk_drives_3330%2B3333.png\n\n% PP: When did you stop working with operators?\n% JH: Somewhere between '85 and '90. There were still operators at the main computer of the university, but there were also small computers, so researchers and student could have direct access when needed. \n\n% PP: When did you start to work with software sold by others or given away in order to do your research?\n% JH: You still needed an operating system for the mainframe that was delivered by IBM or the constructor delivereding the mainframe (% CARLINSAYS: does this make sense with these changes?). When you bought mini-computers, which were the  smaller versions of mainframes, in most cases you bought an operating systems, compilers and all the stuff you needed to be able to program or work  those things. \nIn most cases,  the computer sciences department bought the mini-computer from, for instance *Digital Equipment Corporation*,  a manufactorer at that time, but they didn't buy DEC's  software. The DEC software  was not open source or free,  and as a university we could get Unix for free and could run it on those\n% digital equipment \nDEC computers. That is what the computer department of the University of Louvain la Neuve *l'unité d'informatique*, did and so did we.\n\n% PP: When did you start working with Unix as an OS? \n% JH: I took a trip to Amsterdam, it must have been in 1979 or 1980. Well, the story starts in our French sister university (LLN) where they had a PDP-11 with Unix on it. You could get Unix, at the time, when you were a university, from Bell Labs (part of AT&T), the American telephone company. AT&T was a mega organisation at the time [before the [dismantlment of AT&T/Bell system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breakup_of_the_Bell_System)]. Due to monopoly, the US authorities split it up into different Baby Bells. One of the restrictions was that the research Baby Bell, could not sell anything. There were computer scientists there who developed some interesting things (e.g. Unix). Universities got the source code for free, but NO support, nothing not even how to install it. In Unité d'informatique, where they had a [PDP-11/70](https://i0.wp.com/www.utterpower.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/pdp11-70-panel.jpg) they were lucky: they got the same computer that Unix was developed on.  They got the disk by snail mail as a post-office package. They mounted it and it did spin up and they had UNIX (% CARLINSAYS: is there a reason this is all capital letters?).\nHere, we had a cheaper PDP11, [the PDP 11/60](https://dave.cheney.net/tag/pdp-11). We got the Unix disk distribution from Bell Labs but we could not run it, because we got another type of disk(RK07). We could look at it but that was all, because our disc format was different than the one at Bell Labs. Somebody here (P.Verbaeten) wrote a driver for that disk in l'unité d'informatique of LLN. But they did not have a RK07.  It compiled it but we couldn't try it because we did not have (% CARLINSAYS: I think this should read \"It compiled it but we couldn't try it because we did not have a RKO7\"?). The nearest place with Unix and a RK07 was in Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam.  Andrew Tenenbaum, who wrote a number of books on operating systems, was working there. He was learning to speak Dutch. We understood hisEnglish better but his assistant explained that he needed to practice speaking Dutch because he would have to pass an exam. There we compiled Unix with an RK07 driver and stored it on a bootable RK07 disk. With that disk back in Leuven we could start Unix on our PDP11/60. An error in the process meant a trip Leuven-Amsterdam and back.\nIn my opinion the start of open source was Unix because we had to maintain it by ourselves and we learned a lot from the sources. \nIn that time for software distribution you had to store it on magnetic tape and send the tape to different places with associated problems. For example, the agents at the customs at the airport or post office didn't know what to do with the tapes or discs in terms of custom clearance. They used magnetic or x-rays as inspection tools and we had to write on the package that it should not be x-rayed. And sometimes we still got unreadable tapes/discs. \n\n% PP: So it took weeks between the transportation and the customs?\n% JH: Yes, the custom had to clear the packages. I remember I've been in the customs in Zaventem. I had received a letter that my package from Bell Labs had arrived. I went there thinking I would have to pay something and go. But no. It had to be cleared so there was some organisation that had to do administrative stuff, so I only got it a few days later. The response time was huge. (% CARLINSAYS: This is a nice idiosyncratic pharse so maybe we leave it even if it is a bit hard to understand? I think it means it took a long time for things to be shipped back and forth) \n\n% PP: After that period of time, how did you switch from that kind of collaboration on how to make software and make software work, to another kind of collaboration on networks and between universities and researchers?\n% JH: In the Unix systems at that time there was a kind of networking protocol which worked on serial lines (UUCP).\nTo connect two Unix systems together you only need a serial line. We had a line between LLN and Leuven, it's only 25 kms, but we had to ask Belgacom, then La Régie des Télégraphes et Téléphones, to get a modem to connect through their network and than over that modem you could reach an amazing speed of 300 characters per second. And that was the first communication. It happened somewhere around 1985. And then you had connection with another computer by writing something here and doing the transfer to the other computer and executing it there. \n \n% PP: What was the first thing you sent through a network like this?\n% JH: I didn't do it myself, I remember it was a kind of chat program. On the LLN side was Professor Elie Milgrom. He is retired now. On this side, it was Professor  Yves Willems. And I remember that they typed something and they got a response from the other side and that was it.  But I remember that Professor Willems sent \"Ok, we stop now.\" And that Elie Milgrom answered \"See you later, Alligator\" [a reference to Bill Haley and the Comets]. At the time we still had these kind of songs in mind. (lol). \nThose Unix to Unix connexions were first. And there was a worldwide Unix to Unix based network, Usenet (1979). It still exists somewhere.You can download loads of illegal movies and that stuff. That was not what we meant at the time. But that is what is left. And Usenet became gradually replaced by the Internet in USA. \nIn Europe, the Internet came a lot later, but we had limited access to the Internet by mail and even FTP; We could send mail to the Internet and we could receive mail from them because some friendly American university (and later companiesI translated internet mail to UCP mail. Moreover they translated specially formatted mails into FTP request and sent the result back to us by mail. That was before the 1990's.\n \n% PP: Your relation to software had changed at the time because you did not have to do all this manipulations with the software your received. Was it already floppy discs?\n% JH: No, magnetic tapes, for the mainframe at least. Even most of the mini-computers used some (cheaper) magnetic tapes. Between 1990 and 1995 the main machines used for Unix software development was a VAX from DEC. Once a year the software came from Berkeley. It was still Unix but had been modified by Berkeley for virtual memory and all the stuff which is common now. We received a tape, with lot of goodies, I still remember we didn't know what was on the tape  but we scrutinized it  to find out what was on there, what we could use...\nIn Europe, companies like Siemens were trying to set up software centers to make software avaiable. They were even trying to set up European networks. But researchers loved the Internet. It worked. It was useful for their research. So companies in Europe were trying to set up their own networks, I remember for example the X/OPEN transport protocol, which was a set of standards about what software layers should do. But it didn't succeed because around 1992 IBM decided to quit their own private network and to go for TCP/IP which was the switching point. \nEverything done for X/OPEN were suddently forgotten. For the mainframes, and certainly in Belgium computing was mainly mainframes, I'm talking about universities here, so when IBM decided to go for TCP/IP univversities followed. \nBut the adoption of TCP/IP was really slow. For example, Belgacom was not interested in running the Domain Name System so we did it here, for some time, starting in 1993 with [Pierre Verbaten](https://www.dnsbelgium.be/en/history). Belgacom were focused on X25 (DCS - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X.25) so they missed it.\n\n% PP: It was like the french Minitel?\n% JH: Well, at that time we were really jealous about Minitel. Could you imagine that? Terminals?  At home? You could work home with a computer! You could send emails! All in one, a pc computer with a modem! \n\n% PP: How did the research about software evolved in the department?\n% JH: I am mainly talking about network research but here. There were people working on numerical analysis, computing, artificial intelligence ... I was just not involved in those research so I don't know much about it \n\n% PP: You were focused on software and network..\n% JH: Yes, we did produce some software. We did make software to generate compilers, there was some A.I. software in Prolog, numerical analysis  libraries... Some were sold or shared, it depends.  \nWe did sell some software since the beginning I think when it was not even a department but a professor and a couple of students.\n\n% PP: Is it when you joined?\n% JH: No it was already a department. I did study first industrial engeneering in electronics. At the time in electronics you did hear something about computers, I was interested in it. I wanted to know more. I heard Kuleuvenhad started a\n% year before a\ndegree in computer engeneering. It was the first year where industrial engineers could join. The only thing we knew about computer were from movies. I wanted to know how it work. I'm not sure if I know now it now, but I have some ideas...\n\n% PP: How many language do you know?\n% JH: Assembly, FORTRAN, PL-1 the language invented by IBM to be the universal one, C, Cobol. Perl, I don't know, some  more. I'm not fluent in any computer language, but I can read any language especially well written, I know I can understand it and, if needed,  learn it... I know JAVA also. As a system administrator the thing I use most are the command line of UNIX and Perl. But that's because i'm more familiar with those two so it goes faster.\n\n% PP: How did you see the rise of personnal computer and the software that goes with?\n% JH: I have to admit that we missed it. We didn't see the new thing was powerful because available for everybody.  We were not impressed by the software. I remember windows 95, the news on TV, people sleeping on the street to get it. I remember when I get my first windows version, with a box of 22 floppies or so. Then I wanted to do something, to compile a program, but there was no compiler... We were used to Unix, a basic system but with a lot of utilities in it. Software was for us free, and we were used to have it free and on a pc it was not free anymore. \n\n% PP: Does that mean you didn't had a personnal computer until late?\n% JH: Yes. I think it was round 2000. I didn't needed it really. I got one when the belgian UUCP network became commercial. Of course I did not get Windows on it. I think we got Linux here in 1994. There was a guy involved in the kernel studying here. So we did used it very fast.\n\n% PP: So, what is software for you?\n% JH: For me software is the magic that make computer usable. I can only gives examples of what I mean by it. A PC without software most people, even computer scientists, can't do anything with it. You need basic software. Some software is already integrated in the computer hardware. Same for phones, tablets... The main characteristic, for me, is that it should be user friendly. That is very difficult I know, because you have to imagine what the people using your software are going to do with it and how they want to use it, that's the magic you need to solve.\n\n% PP: Is command line user friendly?\n% JH: Well, somehow you have to learn the Unix command language; it is in fact a computer language where you can make all the constructs that other languages offers.\nYou can create loops, you can test, whatever. It's not so different from computer languages like C or JAVA or whatever. It is certainly programmer friendly.\n\n% PP: But it's already software, no? User friendly depends on what you put behind these words, no?\n% JH: Yes it's already software. I don't have a strong opinion about command lines. It depends on people. I can imagine that someone that has never heard about the command line expects that you click somewhere and it happens. But if you know the command language it's sometimes perhaps easier or productive to type commands and let it run. Sometimes, I find it easier if I have a screen and a number of buttons and I don't have to imagine what happens behind that screen. And sometimes I want to do something with the command line, because I'm used to it. That's why I don't trust myself about user friendliness because I have a long experience in computer interfaces. I'm so used to some of them perhaps I can't even imagine that somebody else would like to do it otherwise or doesn't like what I'm used to.\n\n% PP: Apart from maintaining the museum, what do you work on? You are still active in the department even though you are retired?\n% JH: I work on sensors, in the internet of things world in one of the university spin-off. What I do for them is: wireless sensors need power, most  of them are on batteries. They have designed a complete system which should make the battery last for two, three, four years. They need a system to measure that. So I have been working on a mechanism to measure that without waiting four years. That's programming instrumentation computers to measure e.g. power or whatever. Most of it on Unix systems. \nThere are enough new or unknown things and maybe because I'm older, I have another way of looking at things, so we have a lot of discussions. They don't like my Perl, they use python, JAVA and those things... Perl, it has its disadvantage, but you can do a lot of things. Every  character has a meaning, that makes perl programs often unreadable.\nWith Python, you need all those libraries... It's easy when you know the libraries, what  you have to call. When you know the arguments of the librairies... so it's also complicated. And if the library changes for some reasons, there you go.\nIn my humble opinion it's the same with all the languages. It starts easy from scratch but if you have to interface them with existing things from the internet world or whatever it gets complicated.\n\n% PP: Do you have a last word?\n% JH: I was surprised by your group reaction to the visit. I thought all of this was known. Maybe I'm getting old :) Currently I don't do much about the museum department, but sometimes I like to talk about the little stories about it. I remember a lot of little stories, a lot of technics who have been used and forgotten and some kept alive. I thought when I was young that the best techniques would succeed.

HEADER: Interview with Jean Huens\n\n(% CARLINSAYS: Peggy can you fill in the when and where for this intro and add or change it as you see fit?)\nThe following is a transcript of an interview with Jean Huens conducted by Peggy at X date and Y place.\n\n% PP: You have been using computers since a long time, as you explained to us during the tour we had the joy of attending during the TGSO.\nI heard that until recently, let's say the late 1990s, that to learn computer programming you had to start by writing down the program on paper... (% CARLINSAYS: I want to put a period or a question mark here?) \n% JH: In 1973, I did study computer sciences, it was the second year of the Computer Sciense course, here in Leuven. At the time computers were mainframes and you did feed them with programs by punch cards. Programming was writing down the program, then you punched it and the next day you get results, mostly error. That's the way it worked at that time. To teach us programming, they used the language of that time, Fortran and some kind of invented assembly language, it didn't really exist, it was simplified.\n\nMost of the time you wrote down your program, the teacher and the assistant would have to tell you what is wrong or good, you didn't have much practical experience.\n\n% PP: What was it like, tons of pages? \n% JH: No. As an anecdocte, I remember punchcards were a block of papers, we were jealous of the people who came into the computer center with huge stacks of cards (% CARLINSAYS: The \"block of papers\" is a little confusing. Could we say \"punchcards came in huge stacks\"?). They were really small programs, not complicated one. In fact you had to learn to use the computer from scratch, everything was new, you couldn't rely on previous experiences.\n% , everything was new.\nAnd to start with small programs was difficult enough. \n\nThat was also the time when Edsger W. Dijkstra, who fought against the \"goto\" and other common but bad constructs.[@dijksra:1972:goto] I still remember him, in an audience, giving us a lecture on good  techniques in programming at the International computing symposium 1977 in Liège.[@dijksra:1977:craft] It was a rather hard course because Dijkstra expected you to quickly  understand and implement his ideas.\n\nAnd then from '75 on, computers became cheaper and could be bought by departments and smaller entities. And than came the first interactive computer. They were still beasts, about two cubic meters, costing two millions belgian francs. But it was low (% CARLINSAYS: low?) enough to allow people to type in directly commands. I started working here in '75 as a researcher, it has evolved continuously and I saw computers getting cheaper and getting easier to use.The way to use it was simplified, you could start to go to the beast and try it out.\n\nI remember more or less: you wrote down the program in Fortran for instance. We always thought in the beginning that it would work and it didn't, so after a turn around you were giving it back to the operator and you have to wait another half a day or a night to get the results.\n\n% PP: What kind of program were you working on? \n% JH: I remember the first program I had to write was: you got three numbers and you had to make the program decide if you could construct a triangle with the numbers being the sides of the triangle.\n\n% PP: That took an afternoon to be processed?\n% JH: Well, yeah. You had to imagine how to do it which was also one problem, than you prepare the cards with the punching machine and you give the package of cards to the operator who was feeeding the computer with the cards. Operators were people who had the task of feeding the computers by hand, with paper, cards,(% CARLINSAYS: are these paper cards or paper and then cards because the two are separate?) then cards got written on disks and later processed by the mainframe from disk. Finally results got printed on paper. it lasts onto the magnetic disks period. And after a number of hours or a night you got a listing on a piece of paper with the results or program compilation errors.\n\n% PP: When where you able to record the program onto the machine?\n% JH: I think that happened between '75 and '80. After the punching cards, which were already a way to record the program, we had typewriters and then terminals. We could record the programs by typing it on the terminal  and the computer would store them on disk. We had magnetic discs. IBM had number for everything, I remember the 3300  [manufactured from 1970 on] was a magnetic disk. \nWe didn't touch the machines, operators would change the disks, we could only access the typewriter/terminal. That was our most direct connexion to the computer. The times were different. The mainframes were such huge costly beasts that it had operators day and night to keep it busy. Even at night there were two or three guys mounting tapes, disc mounting tapes, that kind of stuff.\nhttps://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/42/IBM_magnetic_disk_drives_3330%2B3333.png/600px-IBM_magnetic_disk_drives_3330%2B3333.png\n\n% PP: When did you stop working with operators?\n% JH: Somewhere between '85 and '90. There were still operators at the main computer of the university, but there were also small computers, so researchers and student could have direct access when needed. \n\n% PP: When did you start to work with software sold by others or given away in order to do your research?\n% JH: You still needed an operating system for the mainframe that was delivered by IBM or the constructor delivereding the mainframe (% CARLINSAYS: does this make sense with these changes?). When you bought mini-computers, which were the  smaller versions of mainframes, in most cases you bought an operating systems, compilers and all the stuff you needed to be able to program or work  those things. \nIn most cases,  the computer sciences department bought the mini-computer from, for instance *Digital Equipment Corporation*,  a manufactorer at that time, but they didn't buy DEC's  software. The DEC software  was not open source or free,  and as a university we could get Unix for free and could run it on those\n% digital equipment \nDEC computers. That is what the computer department of the University of Louvain la Neuve *l'unité d'informatique*, did and so did we.\n\n% PP: When did you start working with Unix as an OS? \n% JH: I took a trip to Amsterdam, it must have been in 1979 or 1980. Well, the story starts in our French sister university (LLN) where they had a PDP-11 with Unix on it. You could get Unix, at the time, when you were a university, from Bell Labs (part of AT&T), the American telephone company. AT&T was a mega organisation at the time [before the [dismantlment of AT&T/Bell system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breakup_of_the_Bell_System)]. Due to monopoly, the US authorities split it up into different Baby Bells. One of the restrictions was that the research Baby Bell, could not sell anything. There were computer scientists there who developed some interesting things (e.g. Unix). Universities got the source code for free, but NO support, nothing not even how to install it. In Unité d'informatique, where they had a [PDP-11/70](https://i0.wp.com/www.utterpower.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/pdp11-70-panel.jpg) they were lucky: they got the same computer that Unix was developed on.  They got the disk by snail mail as a post-office package. They mounted it and it did spin up and they had UNIX (% CARLINSAYS: is there a reason this is all capital letters?).\nHere, we had a cheaper PDP11, [the PDP 11/60](https://dave.cheney.net/tag/pdp-11). We got the Unix disk distribution from Bell Labs but we could not run it, because we got another type of disk(RK07). We could look at it but that was all, because our disc format was different than the one at Bell Labs. Somebody here (P.Verbaeten) wrote a driver for that disk in l'unité d'informatique of LLN. But they did not have a RK07.  It compiled it but we couldn't try it because we did not have (% CARLINSAYS: I think this should read \"It compiled it but we couldn't try it because we did not have a RKO7\"?). The nearest place with Unix and a RK07 was in Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam.  Andrew Tenenbaum, who wrote a number of books on operating systems, was working there. He was learning to speak Dutch. We understood hisEnglish better but his assistant explained that he needed to practice speaking Dutch because he would have to pass an exam. There we compiled Unix with an RK07 driver and stored it on a bootable RK07 disk. With that disk back in Leuven we could start Unix on our PDP11/60. An error in the process meant a trip Leuven-Amsterdam and back.\nIn my opinion the start of open source was Unix because we had to maintain it by ourselves and we learned a lot from the sources. \nIn that time for software distribution you had to store it on magnetic tape and send the tape to different places with associated problems. For example, the agents at the customs at the airport or post office didn't know what to do with the tapes or discs in terms of custom clearance. They used magnetic or x-rays as inspection tools and we had to write on the package that it should not be x-rayed. And sometimes we still got unreadable tapes/discs. \n\n% PP: So it took weeks between the transportation and the customs?\n% JH: Yes, the custom had to clear the packages. I remember I've been in the customs in Zaventem. I had received a letter that my package from Bell Labs had arrived. I went there thinking I would have to pay something and go. But no. It had to be cleared so there was some organisation that had to do administrative stuff, so I only got it a few days later. The response time was huge. (% CARLINSAYS: This is a nice idiosyncratic pharse so maybe we leave it even if it is a bit hard to understand? I think it means it took a long time for things to be shipped back and forth) \n\n% PP: After that period of time, how did you switch from that kind of collaboration on how to make software and make software work, to another kind of collaboration on networks and between universities and researchers?\n% JH: In the Unix systems at that time there was a kind of networking protocol which worked on serial lines (UUCP).\nTo connect two Unix systems together you only need a serial line. We had a line between LLN and Leuven, it's only 25 kms, but we had to ask Belgacom, then La Régie des Télégraphes et Téléphones, to get a modem to connect through their network and than over that modem you could reach an amazing speed of 300 characters per second. And that was the first communication. It happened somewhere around 1985. And then you had connection with another computer by writing something here and doing the transfer to the other computer and executing it there. \n \n% PP: What was the first thing you sent through a network like this?\n% JH: I didn't do it myself, I remember it was a kind of chat program. On the LLN side was Professor Elie Milgrom. He is retired now. On this side, it was Professor  Yves Willems. And I remember that they typed something and they got a response from the other side and that was it.  But I remember that Professor Willems sent \"Ok, we stop now.\" And that Elie Milgrom answered \"See you later, Alligator\" [a reference to Bill Haley and the Comets]. At the time we still had these kind of songs in mind. (lol). \nThose Unix to Unix connexions were first. And there was a worldwide Unix to Unix based network, Usenet (1979). It still exists somewhere.You can download loads of illegal movies and that stuff. That was not what we meant at the time. But that is what is left. And Usenet became gradually replaced by the Internet in USA. \nIn Europe, the Internet came a lot later, but we had limited access to the Internet by mail and even FTP; We could send mail to the Internet and we could receive mail from them because some friendly American university (and later companiesI translated internet mail to UCP mail. Moreover they translated specially formatted mails into FTP request and sent the result back to us by mail. That was before the 1990's.\n \n% PP: Your relation to software had changed at the time because you did not have to do all this manipulations with the software your received. Was it already floppy discs?\n% JH: No, magnetic tapes, for the mainframe at least. Even most of the mini-computers used some (cheaper) magnetic tapes. Between 1990 and 1995 the main machines used for Unix software development was a VAX from DEC. Once a year the software came from Berkeley. It was still Unix but had been modified by Berkeley for virtual memory and all the stuff which is common now. We received a tape, with lot of goodies, I still remember we didn't know what was on the tape  but we scrutinized it  to find out what was on there, what we could use...\nIn Europe, companies like Siemens were trying to set up software centers to make software avaiable. They were even trying to set up European networks. But researchers loved the Internet. It worked. It was useful for their research. So companies in Europe were trying to set up their own networks, I remember for example the X/OPEN transport protocol, which was a set of standards about what software layers should do. But it didn't succeed because around 1992 IBM decided to quit their own private network and to go for TCP/IP which was the switching point. \nEverything done for X/OPEN were suddently forgotten. For the mainframes, and certainly in Belgium computing was mainly mainframes, I'm talking about universities here, so when IBM decided to go for TCP/IP the universities followed. \nBut the adoption of TCP/IP was really slow. For example, Belgacom was not interested in running the Domain Name System so we did it here, for some time, starting in 1993 with [Pierre Verbaten](https://www.dnsbelgium.be/en/history). Belgacom were focused on X25 (DCS - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X.25) so they missed it.\n\n% PP: It was like the french Minitel?\n% JH: Well, at that time we were really jealous about Minitel. Could you imagine that? Terminals?  At home? You could work home with a computer! You could send emails! All in one, a PC computer with a modem! \n\n% PP: How did the research about software evolve in the department?\n% JH: I am mainly talking about network research but here. There were people working on numerical analysis, computing, artificial intelligence. I was just not involved in that research so I don't know much about it \n\n% PP: You were focused on software and networks?\n% JH: Yes, we produced some software. We made software to generate compilers. There was some A.I. software in Prolog, numerical analysis libraries, etc. Some were sold or shared, it depends.  \nWe sold some software from the beginning I think when it was not even a department but a professor and a couple of students.\n\n% PP: Is that when you joined?\n% JH: No it was already a department. I studied industrial engeneering in electronics first. At the time in electronics you heard something about computers, I was interested in it. I wanted to know more. I heard Kuleuven had started a\n% year before a\ndegree in computer engeneering. It was the first year where industrial engineers could join. The only thing we knew about computers were from movies. I wanted to know how they worked. I'm not sure if I know now it now, but I have some ideas.\n\n% PP: How many languages do you know?\n% JH: Assembly, FORTRAN, PL-1 the language invented by IBM to be the universal one, C, Cobol. Perl...I don't know...some more. I'm not fluent in any computer language, but I can read any language especially well written, I know I can understand it and, if needed, learn it... I know JAVA also. As a system administrator, the thing I use most are the command line of UNIX and Perl. But that's because i'm more familiar with those two so it goes faster.\n\n% PP: How did you see the rise of personnal computer and the software that goes with?\n% JH: I have to admit that we missed it. We didn't see the new thing was powerful because it was available for everybody.  We were not impressed by the software. I remember windows 95, the news on TV, people sleeping on the street to get it. I remember when I got my first windows version, with a box of 22 floppies or so. Then I wanted to do something, to compile a program, but there was no compiler...We were used to Unix, a basic system but with a lot of utilities in it. Software was for us free, and we were used to have it free and on a pc it was not free anymore. \n\n% PP: Does that mean you didn't had a personnal computer until late?\n% JH: Yes. I think it was round 2000. I didn't needed it really. I got one when the belgian UUCP network became commercial. Of course I did not get Windows on it. I think we got Linux here in 1994. There was a guy involved in the kernel studying here. So we did used it very fast.\n\n% PP: So, what is software for you?\n% JH: For me software is the magic that make computer usable. I can only gives examples of what I mean by it. A PC without software most people, even computer scientists, can't do anything with it. You need basic software. Some software is already integrated in the computer hardware. Same for phones, tablets... The main characteristic, for me, is that it should be user friendly. That is very difficult I know, because you have to imagine what the people using your software are going to do with it and how they want to use it, that's the magic you need to solve.\n\n% PP: Is command line user friendly?\n% JH: Well, somehow you have to learn the Unix command language; it is in fact a computer language where you can make all the constructs that other languages offers.\nYou can create loops, you can test, whatever. It's not so different from computer languages like C or JAVA or whatever. It is certainly programmer friendly.\n\n% PP: But it's already software, no? User friendly depends on what you put behind these words, no?\n% JH: Yes it's already software. I don't have a strong opinion about command lines. It depends on people. I can imagine that someone that has never heard about the command line expects that you click somewhere and it happens. But if you know the command language it's sometimes perhaps easier or productive to type commands and let it run. Sometimes, I find it easier if I have a screen and a number of buttons and I don't have to imagine what happens behind that screen. And sometimes I want to do something with the command line, because I'm used to it. That's why I don't trust myself about user friendliness because I have a long experience in computer interfaces. I'm so used to some of them perhaps I can't even imagine that somebody else would like to do it otherwise or doesn't like what I'm used to.\n\n% PP: Apart from maintaining the museum, what do you work on? You are still active in the department even though you are retired?\n% JH: I work on sensors, in the internet of things world in one of the university spin-off. What I do for them is: wireless sensors need power, most  of them are on batteries. They have designed a complete system which should make the battery last for two, three, four years. They need a system to measure that. So I have been working on a mechanism to measure that without waiting four years. That's programming instrumentation computers to measure e.g. power or whatever. Most of it on Unix systems. \nThere are enough new or unknown things and maybe because I'm older, I have another way of looking at things, so we have a lot of discussions. They don't like my Perl, they use python, JAVA and those things... Perl, it has its disadvantage, but you can do a lot of things. Every  character has a meaning, that makes perl programs often unreadable.\nWith Python, you need all those libraries... It's easy when you know the libraries, what  you have to call. When you know the arguments of the librairies... so it's also complicated. And if the library changes for some reasons, there you go.\nIn my humble opinion it's the same with all the languages. It starts easy from scratch but if you have to interface them with existing things from the internet world or whatever it gets complicated.\n\n% PP: Do you have a last word?\n% JH: I was surprised by your group reaction to the visit. I thought all of this was known. Maybe I'm getting old :) Currently I don't do much about the museum department, but sometimes I like to talk about the little stories about it. I remember a lot of little stories, a lot of technics who have been used and forgotten and some kept alive. I thought when I was young that the best techniques would succeed.

add or change it as you see fit?)\nThe following is a transcript of an interview with Jean Huens conducted by Peggy at X date and Y place.\n\n% PP: You have been using computers since a long time, as you explained to us during the tour we had the joy of attending during the TGSO.\nI heard that until recently, let's say the late 1990s, that to learn computer programming you had to start by writing down the program on paper... (% CARLINSAYS: I want to put a period or a question mark here?) \n% JH: In 1973, I did study computer sciences, it was the second year of the Computer Sciense course, here in Leuven. At the time computers were mainframes and you did feed them with programs by punch cards. Programming was writing down the program, then you punched it and the next day you get results, mostly error. That's the way it worked at that time. To teach us programming, they used the language of that time, Fortran and some kind of invented assembly language, it didn't really exist, it was simplified.\n\nMost of the time you wrote down your program, the teacher and the assistant would have to tell you what is wrong or good, you didn't have much practical experience.\n\n% PP: What was it like, tons of pages? \n% JH: No. As an anecdocte, I remember punchcards were a block of papers, we were jealous of the people who came into the computer center with huge stacks of cards (% CARLINSAYS: The \"block of papers\" is a little confusing. Could we say \"punchcards came in huge stacks\"?). They were really small programs, not complicated one. In fact you had to learn to use the computer from scratch, everything was new, you couldn't rely on previous experiences.\n% , everything was new.\nAnd to start with small programs was difficult enough. \n\nThat was also the time when Edsger W. Dijkstra, who fought against the \"goto\" and other common but bad constructs.[@dijksra:1972:goto] I still remember him, in an audience, giving us a lecture on good  techniques in programming at the International computing symposium 1977 in Liège.[@dijksra:1977:craft] It was a rather hard course because Dijkstra expected you to quickly  understand and implement his ideas.\n\nAnd then from '75 on, computers became cheaper and could be bought by departments and smaller entities. And than came the first interactive computer. They were still beasts, about two cubic meters, costing two millions belgian francs. But it was low (% CARLINSAYS: low?) enough to allow people to type in directly commands. I started working here in '75 as a researcher, it has evolved continuously and I saw computers getting cheaper and getting easier to use.The way to use it was simplified, you could start to go to the beast and try it out.\n\nI remember more or less: you wrote down the program in Fortran for instance. We always thought in the beginning that it would work and it didn't, so after a turn around you were giving it back to the operator and you have to wait another half a day or a night to get the results.\n\n% PP: What kind of program were you working on? \n% JH: I remember the first program I had to write was: you got three numbers and you had to make the program decide if you could construct a triangle with the numbers being the sides of the triangle.\n\n% PP: That took an afternoon to be processed?\n% JH: Well, yeah. You had to imagine how to do it which was also one problem, than you prepare the cards with the punching machine and you give the package of cards to the operator who was feeeding the computer with the cards. Operators were people who had the task of feeding the computers by hand, with paper, cards,(% CARLINSAYS: are these paper cards or paper and then cards because the two are separate?) then cards got written on disks and later processed by the mainframe from disk. Finally results got printed on paper. it lasts onto the magnetic disks period. And after a number of hours or a night you got a listing on a piece of paper with the results or program compilation errors.\n\n% PP: When where you able to record the program onto the machine?\n% JH: I think that happened between '75 and '80. After the punching cards, which were already a way to record the program, we had typewriters and then terminals. We could record the programs by typing it on the terminal  and the computer would store them on disk. We had magnetic discs. IBM had number for everything, I remember the 3300  [manufactured from 1970 on] was a magnetic disk. \nWe didn't touch the machines, operators would change the disks, we could only access the typewriter/terminal. That was our most direct connexion to the computer. The times were different. The mainframes were such huge costly beasts that it had operators day and night to keep it busy. Even at night there were two or three guys mounting tapes, disc mounting tapes, that kind of stuff.\nhttps://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/42/IBM_magnetic_disk_drives_3330%2B3333.png/600px-IBM_magnetic_disk_drives_3330%2B3333.png\n\n% PP: When did you stop working with operators?\n% JH: Somewhere between '85 and '90. There were still operators at the main computer of the university, but there were also small computers, so researchers and student could have direct access when needed. \n\n% PP: When did you start to work with software sold by others or given away in order to do your research?\n% JH: You still needed an operating system for the mainframe that was delivered by IBM or the constructor delivereding the mainframe (% CARLINSAYS: does this make sense with these changes?). When you bought mini-computers, which were the  smaller versions of mainframes, in most cases you bought an operating systems, compilers and all the stuff you needed to be able to program or work  those things. \nIn most cases,  the computer sciences department bought the mini-computer from, for instance *Digital Equipment Corporation*,  a manufactorer at that time, but they didn't buy DEC's  software. The DEC software  was not open source or free,  and as a university we could get Unix for free and could run it on those\n% digital equipment \nDEC computers. That is what the computer department of the University of Louvain la Neuve *l'unité d'informatique*, did and so did we.\n\n% PP: When did you start working with Unix as an OS? \n% JH: I took a trip to Amsterdam, it must have been in 1979 or 1980. Well, the story starts in our French sister university (LLN) where they had a PDP-11 with Unix on it. You could get Unix, at the time, when you were a university, from Bell Labs (part of AT&T), the American telephone company. AT&T was a mega organisation at the time [before the [dismantlment of AT&T/Bell system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breakup_of_the_Bell_System)]. Due to monopoly, the US authorities split it up into different Baby Bells. One of the restrictions was that the research Baby Bell, could not sell anything. There were computer scientists there who developed some interesting things (e.g. Unix). Universities got the source code for free, but NO support, nothing not even how to install it. In Unité d'informatique, where they had a [PDP-11/70](https://i0.wp.com/www.utterpower.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/pdp11-70-panel.jpg) they were lucky: they got the same computer that Unix was developed on.  They got the disk by snail mail as a post-office package. They mounted it and it did spin up and they had UNIX (% CARLINSAYS: is there a reason this is all capital letters?).\nHere, we had a cheaper PDP11, [the PDP 11/60](https://dave.cheney.net/tag/pdp-11). We got the Unix disk distribution from Bell Labs but we could not run it, because we got another type of disk(RK07). We could look at it but that was all, because our disc format was different than the one at Bell Labs. Somebody here (P.Verbaeten) wrote a driver for that disk in l'unité d'informatique of LLN. But they did not have a RK07.  It compiled it but we couldn't try it because we did not have (% CARLINSAYS: I think this should read \"It compiled it but we couldn't try it because we did not have a RKO7\"?). The nearest place with Unix and a RK07 was in Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam.  Andrew Tenenbaum, who wrote a number of books on operating systems, was working there. He was learning to speak Dutch. We understood hisEnglish better but his assistant explained that he needed to practice speaking Dutch because he would have to pass an exam. There we compiled Unix with an RK07 driver and stored it on a bootable RK07 disk. With that disk back in Leuven we could start Unix on our PDP11/60. An error in the process meant a trip Leuven-Amsterdam and back.\nIn my opinion the start of open source was Unix because we had to maintain it by ourselves and we learned a lot from the sources. \nIn that time for software distribution you had to store it on magnetic tape and send the tape to different places with associated problems. For example, the agents at the customs at the airport or post office didn't know what to do with the tapes or discs in terms of custom clearance. They used magnetic or x-rays as inspection tools and we had to write on the package that it should not be x-rayed. And sometimes we still got unreadable tapes/discs. \n\n% PP: So it took weeks between the transportation and the customs?\n% JH: Yes, the custom had to clear the packages. I remember I've been in the customs in Zaventem. I had received a letter that my package from Bell Labs had arrived. I went there thinking I would have to pay something and go. But no. It had to be cleared so there was some organisation that had to do administrative stuff, so I only got it a few days later. The response time was huge. (% CARLINSAYS: This is a nice idiosyncratic pharse so maybe we leave it even if it is a bit hard to understand? I think it means it took a long time for things to be shipped back and forth) \n\n% PP: After that period of time, how did you switch from that kind of collaboration on how to make software and make software work, to another kind of collaboration on networks and between universities and researchers?\n% JH: In the Unix systems at that time there was a kind of networking protocol which worked on serial lines (UUCP).\nTo connect two Unix systems together you only need a serial line. We had a line between LLN and Leuven, it's only 25 kms, but we had to ask Belgacom, then La Régie des Télégraphes et Téléphones, to get a modem to connect through their network and than over that modem you could reach an amazing speed of 300 characters per second. And that was the first communication. It happened somewhere around 1985. And then you had connection with another computer by writing something here and doing the transfer to the other computer and executing it there. \n \n% PP: What was the first thing you sent through a network like this?\n% JH: I didn't do it myself, I remember it was a kind of chat program. On the LLN side was Professor Elie Milgrom. He is retired now. On this side, it was Professor  Yves Willems. And I remember that they typed something and they got a response from the other side and that was it.  But I remember that Professor Willems sent \"Ok, we stop now.\" And that Elie Milgrom answered \"See you later, Alligator\" [a reference to Bill Haley and the Comets]. At the time we still had these kind of songs in mind. (lol). \nThose Unix to Unix connexions were first. And there was a worldwide Unix to Unix based network, Usenet (1979). It still exists somewhere.You can download loads of illegal movies and that stuff. That was not what we meant at the time. But that is what is left. And Usenet became gradually replaced by the Internet in USA. \nIn Europe, the Internet came a lot later, but we had limited access to the Internet by mail and even FTP; We could send mail to the Internet and we could receive mail from them because some friendly American university (and later companiesI translated internet mail to UCP mail. Moreover they translated specially formatted mails into FTP request and sent the result back to us by mail. That was before the 1990's.\n \n% PP: Your relation to software had changed at the time because you did not have to do all this manipulations with the software your received. Was it already floppy discs?\n% JH: No, magnetic tapes, for the mainframe at least. Even most of the mini-computers used some (cheaper) magnetic tapes. Between 1990 and 1995 the main machines used for Unix software development was a VAX from DEC. Once a year the software came from Berkeley. It was still Unix but had been modified by Berkeley for virtual memory and all the stuff which is common now. We received a tape, with lot of goodies, I still remember we didn't know what was on the tape  but we scrutinized it  to find out what was on there, what we could use...\nIn Europe, companies like Siemens were trying to set up software centers to make software avaiable. They were even trying to set up European networks. But researchers loved the Internet. It worked. It was useful for their research. So companies in Europe were trying to set up their own networks, I remember for example the X/OPEN transport protocol, which was a set of standards about what software layers should do. But it didn't succeed because around 1992 IBM decided to quit their own private network and to go for TCP/IP which was the switching point. \nEverything done for X/OPEN were suddently forgotten. For the mainframes, and certainly in Belgium computing was mainly mainframes, I'm talking about universities here, so when IBM decided to go for TCP/IP the universities followed. \nBut the adoption of TCP/IP was really slow. For example, Belgacom was not interested in running the Domain Name System so we did it here, for some time, starting in 1993 with [Pierre Verbaten](https://www.dnsbelgium.be/en/history). Belgacom were focused on X25 (DCS - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X.25) so they missed it.\n\n% PP: It was like the french Minitel?\n% JH: Well, at that time we were really jealous about Minitel. Could you imagine that? Terminals?  At home? You could work home with a computer! You could send emails! All in one, a PC computer with a modem! \n\n% PP: How did the research about software evolve in the department?\n% JH: I am mainly talking about network research but here. There were people working on numerical analysis, computing, artificial intelligence. I was just not involved in that research so I don't know much about it \n\n% PP: You were focused on software and networks?\n% JH: Yes, we produced some software. We made software to generate compilers. There was some A.I. software in Prolog, numerical analysis libraries, etc. Some were sold or shared, it depends.  \nWe sold some software from the beginning I think when it was not even a department but a professor and a couple of students.\n\n% PP: Is that when you joined?\n% JH: No it was already a department. I studied industrial engeneering in electronics first. At the time in electronics you heard something about computers, I was interested in it. I wanted to know more. I heard Kuleuven had started a\n% year before a\ndegree in computer engeneering. It was the first year where industrial engineers could join. The only thing we knew about computers were from movies. I wanted to know how they worked. I'm not sure if I know now it now, but I have some ideas.\n\n% PP: How many languages do you know?\n% JH: Assembly, FORTRAN, PL-1 the language invented by IBM to be the universal one, C, Cobol. Perl...I don't know...some more. I'm not fluent in any computer language, but I can read any language especially well written, I know I can understand it and, if needed, learn it... I know JAVA also. As a system administrator, the thing I use most are the command line of UNIX and Perl. But that's because i'm more familiar with those two so it goes faster.\n\n% PP: How did you see the rise of personnal computer and the software that goes with?\n% JH: I have to admit that we missed it. We didn't see the new thing was powerful because it was available for everybody.  We were not impressed by the software. I remember windows 95, the news on TV, people sleeping on the street to get it. I remember when I got my first windows version, with a box of 22 floppies or so. Then I wanted to do something, to compile a program, but there was no compiler. We were used to Unix, which was a basic system but haa lot of utilities in it. Software was for us free, and we were used to having it be free, and on a PC it was not free anymore. \n\n% PP: Does that mean you didn't had a personal computer until late?\n% JH: Yes. I think it was round 2000. I didn't need it really. I got one when the Belgian UUCP network became commercial. Of course I did not get Windows on it. I think we got Linux here in 1994. There was a guy involved in the kernel studying here. So we did used it very fast.\n\n% PP: So, what is software for you?\n% JH: For me, software is the magic that makes computer usable. I can only gives examples of what I mean by it. A PC without software- most people, even computer scientists, can't do anything with it. You need basic software. Some software is already integrated in the computer hardware. It is the same for phones, tablets. The main characteristic, for me, is that it should be user friendly. That is very difficult I know, because you have to imagine what the people using your software are going to do with it and how they want to use it. That's the magic you need to solve.\n\n% PP: Is command line user friendly?\n% JH: Well, somehow you have to learn the Unix command language; it is in fact a computer language where you can make all the constructs that other languages offers.\nYou can create loops, you can test, whatever. It's not so different from computer languages like C or JAVA or whatever. It is certainly programmer friendly.\n\n% PP: But it's already software, no? User friendly depends on what you put behind these words, no?\n% JH: Yes it's already software. I don't have a strong opinion about command lines. It depends on people. I can imagine that someone that has never heard about the command line expects that you click somewhere and it happens. But if you know the command language it's sometimes perhaps easier or productive to type commands and let it run. Sometimes, I find it easier if I have a screen and a number of buttons and I don't have to imagine what happens behind that screen. And sometimes I want to do something with the command line, because I'm used to it. That's why I don't trust myself about user friendliness because I have a long experience in computer interfaces. I'm so used to some of them perhaps I can't even imagine that somebody else would like to do it otherwise or doesn't like what I'm used to.\n\n% PP: Apart from maintaining the museum, what do you work on? You are still active in the department even though you are retired?\n% JH: I work on sensors, in the Internet of Things world in one of the university spin-offs. What I do for them is: wireless sensors need power, most of them are on batteries. They have designed a complete system which should make the battery last for two, three, four years. They need a system to measure that. So I have been working on a mechanism to measure that without waiting four years. That's programming instrumentation computers to measure e.g. power or whatever. Most of it on Unix systems. \nThere are enough new or unknown things and maybe because I'm older, I have another way of looking at things, so we have a lot of discussions. They don't like my Perl, they use python, JAVA and those things... Perl, it has its disadvantages, but you can do a lot of things. Every character has a meaning, that makes Perl programs often unreadable.\nWith Python, you need all those libraries... It's easy when you know the libraries, what you have to call. When you know the arguments of the librairies. So it's also complicated. And if the library changes for some reasons, there you go.\nIn my humble opinion it's the same with all the languages. It starts easy from scratch but if you have to interface them with existing things from the Internet world or whatever it gets complicated.\n\n% PP: Do you have a last word?\n% JH: I was surprised by your group reaction to the visit. I thought all of this was known. Maybe I'm getting old :) (% CARLINSAYS:Do we want to include the smiley face or was Currently I don't do much about the museum department, but sometimes I like to talk about the little stories about it. I remember a lot of little stories, a lot of technics who have been used and forgotten and some kept alive. I thought when I was young that the best techniques would succeed. That you would have visionary people who would see the way. But I realized that a lot of things do happen by accident.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","attribs":"*7+a*7*3+p*7|1+1*g|1+1*f+2*7+1*f|1+2y*f+2v*g|1+1*6|1+1*h+6*5+1u*f*5+3*5+12*f*5+8*5+h*6|1+1*5+1j*f*5+7*5+2c*f*5+1*f+2*7+1*f+1o*5+1*6|1+1*h+6+9*f+1+1o*d+n+1y*f+1+18*f+1+10*d+1+3e*f+1+o*h+1+1t*h+1+1b*6|2+2+l*j+5+31*j+3+q*6|1+1|1+1*h+6*f*5+4*5+c*j*5+1*5+g*6|1+1*h+6+l*h+1+16*e+1+17*f+2+1a*j+30+4*f+2+1e*d+2+3a*h|1+2*h*e+2*e+k+1*h|1+1+1j*6|2+2+1h*f+5+d*j+1+4*j+1+10*7+1*0+k+44*7+1*0+l+2y*6|2+2+e*f+1+3r*j+b+b*j+1+24*j+m+27*f+1+p*d+1+q*f+1+d*d+1+3j*6|2+2+t*f+6+14*f+2+49*d+8+15*6|2+2*h+6*5+l*j*5+8*5+d*6|1+1*h+6+t*h+1+h*d+1+m*j+4+17*d+6+1y*6|2+2*h+6*5+13*6|1+1*h+6+2p*d+1+3f*d+8*j+8+5*j+4+b*j+5+3*d+1+1*j+3+y*j+1+7*j+28+1*j+b+2*d+1+2*d+l+9*d+2a+1*e+14+19*d+1+b*j+3+h*j+1+g*d+u+1*6|2+2*h+6*5+1n*6|1+1*h+6+c*d+1+6*f+2+9*f+1+7*f+1+s*d+1+8*f+3+1k*d+a+9*d+1+1*d+1+r*d+u+1*d+n+e*d*e+4*e+8+1c*h+1+g*d+1+2*d+1+s*d+4+h*d|1+1+2r*d+9+1l*0+1+g*j+2+2c*d+3+24*j+2+z*6|1+1+41*6|2+2*h+6*5+15*6|1+1*h+6+i*f+1+7*f+1+3s*d+4+x*6|2+2*h+6*5+1r*f*5+1*5+z*6|1+1*h+6+8*f+1+5*j+2+l*j+3+1v*j+2*e+3+e*j+1l+2s*j+6+1j*j+6+m*d+9+f*d|1+1+f*d+1+x*j+6+13*d+1+7*d+1+9*d+1+t*d+2+w*d+6+e*d+e+2*d+2+r*d+m+g*d+9+p*h|1+1*h*e+2*e+i*h|1+1+3q*6|2+2*h+6*5+w*j*5+1*5+a*j*5+2*5+2*6|1+1*h+6+1h*j+a+u*j+1+15*j+3+9*0+1+f*0+2+4*d+a+1g*d+n+7*j+1+r*d+2*h+1*d+1+3z*d+1+15*d+3+6*j+2+19*j+1+8*d+6+9*j+1+4*j+1+a*d+4+f*d+1+1c*j+2+4*d+1+j*d+c+2*j+1+c*j+3+b*j+5+1*d+h+7*d+11+p*0+i*h+1*0+9*h+2*0+2a*h+1+1e*j+1+5*d+2+3e*d+4*j+1r+1*6|1+1+9*j+3+g*0+1*h+2*0+d*h+1*0+11+1*0+38+2q*0+4+2*0+s*j+5*0+1m*0*e+s*e+3*j*e+1*e+2*j*e+8*e+1e*j+35*0+1+1*h+2*0+u*j+2*0+1i*h+1*0+a*j+5*0+2d*j+1*0+n*j+1*0+9b*d|1+1*d+1+1j*j+2*d+1+1y*0+1*d|1+1+d*d+t+1*j+3+4*d+5+1*d+2+1*d+l+1*d+c+k*d+p+13*d+1+n*j+7+x*d+9+1n*j+1+4*d+p+1q*h+1*d+p+c*d+6+7*0|2+2*h+6*5+17*j*5+5*5+a*j*5+2*0|1+1*h+6+1i*h+1+2f*0+4+10*h+1+25*j+1+1n*h+1+1l*j+5c*0|2+2*h+6*j+5*5+k*j*5+1*5+2q*j*5+1*5+3*j*5+g*5+q*j*5+4*5+11*j*5+1*0|1+1*h+6+i*d+1+1*d+2+1l*j+6+g*d+7+1*0|1+1*d+2+d*j+1+11*d+7+d*d+6+z*d+1+11*d+1+1*2+e*d*2+1*2+e*d*2+1*2+b+5n*j+2+q*j+5+m*j+3+u*j+3+1*d+19*j+3*d+9+2*0|1+1+1*0|1+1*h+6*5+w*j*5+1*5+t*0|1+1*h+6+n*h+1+15*d+1+2*j+4+d*d+4*j+5*7+1+c*j+1+1*j+3+13*d+2*j+5+1*d+6+d*h+1+2u*h+1+h*7+2*j+5+f*j+3+c*j+1+4l*d|1+1+31*j+3+p*j+1+k*j+1+x*j+3+3i*d|1+1+1h*d+8+m*d+o+m*d+b+10*j+a+d*j+1+8*j+g+f*j+1+a*j+1+r*j+2*d+m*j+1*d+1f*j+1*d+w+r*0|1+1+1*0|1+1*h+6*5+4l*0|1+1*h+6+1c*d+6+q*j+5+5*d+1+6*d+2+p*j+2+7*j+2+l*d+5+4*d+5+9*d+c+1r*j+3+l*j+9+1s*j+2+1i*h+1+1a*d+6+g*j+1+1*j+1+1*d+3+4*j+8+a*d+3+g*j+4+5*d+2*0|1+1+2q*j+3+v*d+9+a*d+5+f*j+1+d*j+1+1*j+1+8*j+3+1j*j+1+16*h+1+1e*j+9+6*j+4+1d*j+1+1*j+1+t*d+b+1o*j+1+7*j+5+q*d|1+1+3n*h+1+20*j+4+1*j+1*d+c+6*j+2*d+1+1*d|1+1*d+9*j+7*d+s+3n*h+1+f*h+1+3m*0|2+2*h+6*5+v*0|1+1*h+6+4w*j+2+o*0|2+2*h+6*5+15*j*5+1*5+j*0|1+1*h+6+1f*d+3+2a*j+1+u*j+2+d*h+1+q*0|2+2*h+6*5+14*j*5+2*0|1+1*h+6+f*j+1+j*j+5+u*j+1+1*j+1+1v*j+6+14*0|1+1+3*j+4+f*j+4+f*h+1+2a*0|2+2*h+6*5+3*j*5+4*5+h*0|1+1*h+6+y*j+7+12*j+6+x*j+5+s*h+1+l*h+1+1*h+1+u*d+8*j+1+d*h|1+1*h*e+2*e+d*h|1+1+27*d+1+1e*j+1+6*d+4+u*j+4+5*j+2+g*d+4+9*d+e+g*0|2+2*h+6*5+d*h*5+1*5+3*j*5+1*5+d*0|1+1*h+6+w*h+1+1n*j+3*h+1+b*j+3+2*d+3+s*d+8+5*h+1+9*h+1+i*h+1+t*d+2+4*h+1*d+1+m*d+a*h+1*d+2+b*h+1+17*j+1+a*d+2+3b*0|2+2*h+6*5+27*0|1+1*h+6+1f*d+2+4*d+6+c*d+9*j+7*d+p+3s*h+1+2*j+1+1u*h+1+21*j+1+m*j+a+j*j+2+23*j+3+1*j+5+5*j+2+4*d+5*j+3+p*0|2+2*h+6*5+1p*0|1+1*h+6+24*j+1+8*d+1+14*h+1+41*0|2+2*h+6*5+t*0|1+1*h+6+6*j+1+w*j+1+1g*h+1+y*j+2+2x*d+3+19*j+b+o*j+1+2k*h+1+3e*j+3+y*0|2+2*h+6*5+u*0|1+1*h+6+10*d+5+c*h+1+3*d+4+r*h+1+1l*h+1+c*0|1+1+2e*h+1+w*d+11*0|2+2*h+6*5+p*h*5+1*5+1u*0|1+1*h+6+3q*h+1+16*h+1+22*h+1+2k*h+1+j*h+1+17*h+1+1y*h+1+1h*h+1+q*h+1+1g*h+1+2c*h+1+2i*h+1+b*0|2+2*h+6*5+3f*0|1+1*h+6+q*j+1+b*j+1+19*j+1+7*h+1+f*d+1+a*d+8+c*d+5+4l*d+6+3f*d+1+5*d+5+h*d+1+1*d+e+e*d|1+1+1l*h+1+a*h+1+3c*d+4*h+1+c*j+2*d+1+l*h+1+7*j+1+b*d+2+i*d+9+n*d+d*j+1*d|1+v+18*h+1+11*d+4*h+1*d+2+1s*h+1*j+1+q*h+1+n*d+1+w*d|1+1+1g*h+1+2f*d+1+a*j+1+1a*0|2+2*h+6*5+o*0|1+1*h+6+24*d+2+e*h+1+h*j+1o+3*h+1+6*h+1+1m*h+1+4s*h+1+37*h+1+t*d+4+k*0|1+1*6|3+3*0|1+1*j|1+1|1+1"}}},"pad:observatory.guide.jeanhuensitvextended:revs:10801":{"changeset":"Z:g22>5|2z=flj=4w*j+5$that

HEADER: Interview with Jean Huens\n\n(% CARLINSAYS: Peggy can you fill in the when and where for this intro and add or change it as you see fit?)\nThe following is a transcript of an interview with Jean Huens conducted by Peggy at X date and Y place.\n\n% PP: You have been using computers since a long time, as you explained to us during the tour we had the joy of attending during the TGSO.\nI heard that until recently, let's say the late 1990s, that to learn computer programming you had to start by writing down the program on paper...\n% CARLINSAYS: I want to put a period or a question mark here?\n% JH: In 1973, I did study computer sciences, it was the second year of the Computer Sciense course, here in Leuven. At the time computers were mainframes and you did feed them with programs by punch cards. Programming was writing down the program, then you punched it and the next day you get results, mostly error. That's the way it worked at that time. To teach us programming, they used the language of that time, Fortran and some kind of invented assembly language, it didn't really exist, it was simplified.\n\nMost of the time you wrote down your program, the teacher and the assistant would have to tell you what is wrong or good, you didn't have much practical experience.\n\n% PP: What was it like, tons of pages? \n% JH: No. As an anecdocte, I remember punchcards were a block of papers, we were jealous of the people who came into the computer center with huge stacks of cards.\n% CARLINSAYS: The \"block of papers\" is a little confusing. Could we say \"punchcards came in huge stacks\"?\nThey were really small programs, not complicated one. In fact you had to learn to use the computer from scratch, everything was new, you couldn't rely on previous experiences.\n% , everything was new.\nAnd to start with small programs was difficult enough. \n\nThat was also the time when Edsger W. Dijkstra, who fought against the \"goto\" and other common but bad constructs.[@dijksra:1972:goto] I still remember him, in an audience, giving us a lecture on good  techniques in programming at the International computing symposium 1977 in Liège.[@dijksra:1977:craft] It was a rather hard course because Dijkstra expected you to quickly  understand and implement his ideas.\n\nAnd then from '75 on, computers became cheaper and could be bought by departments and smaller entities. And than came the first interactive computer. They were still beasts, about two cubic meters, costing two millions belgian francs. But it was low\n% CARLINSAYS: low?\nenough to allow people to type in directly commands. I started working here in '75 as a researcher, it has evolved continuously and I saw computers getting cheaper and getting easier to use.The way to use it was simplified, you could start to go to the beast and try it out.\n\nI remember more or less: you wrote down the program in Fortran for instance. We always thought in the beginning that it would work and it didn't, so after a turn around you were giving it back to the operator and you have to wait another half a day or a night to get the results.\n\n% PP: What kind of program were you working on? \n% JH: I remember the first program I had to write was: you got three numbers and you had to make the program decide if you could construct a triangle with the numbers being the sides of the triangle.\n\n% PP: That took an afternoon to be processed?\n% JH: Well, yeah. You had to imagine how to do it which was also one problem, than you prepare the cards with the punching machine and you give the package of cards to the operator who was feeeding the computer with the cards. Operators were people who had the task of feeding the computers by hand, with paper, cards,\n% CARLINSAYS: are these paper cards or paper and then cards because the two are separate?\nthen cards got written on disks and later processed by the mainframe from disk. Finally results got printed on paper.\n% it lasts onto the magnetic disks period.\nAnd after a number of hours or a night you got a listing on a piece of paper with the results or program compilation errors.\n\n% PP: When where you able to record the program onto the machine?\n% JH: I think that happened between '75 and '80. After the punching cards, which were already a way to record the program, we had typewriters and then terminals. We could record the programs by typing it on the terminal  and the computer would store them on disk. We had magnetic discs. IBM had number for everything, I remember the 3300  [manufactured from 1970 on] was a magnetic disk. \nWe didn't touch the machines, operators would change the disks, we could only access the typewriter/terminal. That was our most direct connexion to the computer. The times were different. The mainframes were such huge costly beasts that it had operators day and night to keep it busy. Even at night there were two or three guys mounting tapes, disc mounting tapes, that kind of stuff.\nhttps://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/42/IBM_magnetic_disk_drives_3330%2B3333.png/600px-IBM_magnetic_disk_drives_3330%2B3333.png\n\n% PP: When did you stop working with operators?\n% JH: Somewhere between '85 and '90. There were still operators at the main computer of the university, but there were also small computers, so researchers and student could have direct access when needed. \n\n% PP: When did you start to work with software sold by others or given away in order to do your research?\n% JH: You still needed an operating system for the mainframe that was delivered by IBM or the constructor delivered\n% ing\nthe mainframe.\n% CARLINSAYS: does this make sense with these changes?\nWhen you bought mini-computers, which were the  smaller versions of mainframes, in most cases you bought an operating systems, compilers and all the stuff you needed to be able to program or work  those things. \nIn most cases,  the computer sciences department bought the mini-computer from, for instance *Digital Equipment Corporation*,  a manufactorer at that time, but they didn't buy DEC's  software. The DEC software  was not open source or free,  and as a university we could get Unix for free and could run it on those\n% digital equipment \nDEC computers. That is what the computer department of the University of Louvain la Neuve *l'unité d'informatique*, did and so did we.\n\n% PP: When did you start working with Unix as an OS? \n% JH: I took a trip to Amsterdam, it must have been in 1979 or 1980. Well, the story starts in our French sister university (LLN) where they had a PDP-11 with Unix on it. You could get Unix, at the time, when you were a university, from Bell Labs (part of AT&T), the American telephone company. AT&T was a mega organisation at the time [before the [dismantlment of AT&T/Bell system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breakup_of_the_Bell_System)]. Due to monopoly, the US authorities split it up into different Baby Bells. One of the restrictions was that the research Baby Bell, could not sell anything. There were computer scientists there who developed some interesting things (e.g. Unix). Universities got the source code for free, but NO support, nothing not even how to install it. In Unité d'informatique, where they had a [PDP-11/70](https://i0.wp.com/www.utterpower.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/pdp11-70-panel.jpg) they were lucky: they got the same computer that Unix was developed on.  They got the disk by snail mail as a post-office package. They mounted it and it did spin up and they had UNIX.\n% CARLINSAYS: is there a reason this is all capital letters?\nHere, we had a cheaper PDP11, [the PDP 11/60](https://dave.cheney.net/tag/pdp-11). We got the Unix disk distribution from Bell Labs but we could not run it, because we got another type of disk(RK07). We could look at it but that was all, because our disc format was different than the one at Bell Labs. Somebody here (P.Verbaeten) wrote a driver for that disk in l'unité d'informatique of LLN.\n% But they did not have a RK07.  It compiled it but we couldn't try it because we did not have \n% CARLINSAYS: I think this should read \"It compiled it but we couldn't try it because we did not have a RKO7\"?)\nThe nearest place with Unix and a RK07 was in Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam.  Andrew Tenenbaum, who wrote a number of books on operating systems, was working there. He was learning to speak Dutch. We understood hisEnglish better but his assistant explained that he needed to practice speaking Dutch because he would have to pass an exam. There we compiled Unix with an RK07 driver and stored it on a bootable RK07 disk. With that disk back in Leuven we could start Unix on our PDP11/60. An error in the process meant a trip Leuven-Amsterdam and back.\nIn my opinion the start of open source was Unix because we had to maintain it by ourselves and we learned a lot from the sources. \nIn that time for software distribution you had to store it on magnetic tape and send the tape to different places with associated problems. For example, the agents at the customs at the airport or post office didn't know what to do with the tapes or discs in terms of custom clearance. They used magnetic or x-rays as inspection tools and we had to write on the package that it should not be x-rayed. And sometimes we still got unreadable tapes/discs. \n\n% PP: So it took weeks between the transportation and the customs?\n% JH: Yes, the custom had to clear the packages. I remember I've been in the customs in Zaventem. I had received a letter that my package from Bell Labs had arrived. I went there thinking I would have to pay something and go. But no. It had to be cleared so there was some organisation that had to do administrative stuff, so I only got it a few days later. The response time was huge.\n% CARLINSAYS: This is a nice idiosyncratic pharse so maybe we leave it even if it is a bit hard to understand? I think it means it took a long time for things to be shipped back and forth) \n\n% PP: After that period of time, how did you switch from that kind of collaboration on how to make software and make software work, to another kind of collaboration on networks and between universities and researchers?\n% JH: In the Unix systems at that time there was a kind of networking protocol which worked on serial lines (UUCP).\nTo connect two Unix systems together you only need a serial line. We had a line between LLN and Leuven, it's only 25 kms, but we had to ask Belgacom, then La Régie des Télégraphes et Téléphones, to get a modem to connect through their network and than over that modem you could reach an amazing speed of 300 characters per second. And that was the first communication. It happened somewhere around 1985. And then you had connection with another computer by writing something here and doing the transfer to the other computer and executing it there. \n \n% PP: What was the first thing you sent through a network like this?\n% JH: I didn't do it myself, I remember it was a kind of chat program. On the LLN side was Professor Elie Milgrom. He is retired now. On this side, it was Professor  Yves Willems. And I remember that they typed something and they got a response from the other side and that was it.  But I remember that Professor Willems sent \"Ok, we stop now.\" And that Elie Milgrom answered \"See you later, Alligator\" [a reference to Bill Haley and the Comets]. At the time we still had these kind of songs in mind. (lol). \nThose Unix to Unix connexions were first. And there was a worldwide Unix to Unix based network, Usenet (1979). It still exists somewhere.You can download loads of illegal movies and that stuff. That was not what we meant at the time. But that is what is left. And Usenet became gradually replaced by the Internet in USA. \nIn Europe, the Internet came a lot later, but we had limited access to the Internet by mail and even FTP; We could send mail to the Internet and we could receive mail from them because some friendly American university (and later companiesI translated internet mail to UCP mail. Moreover they translated specially formatted mails into FTP request and sent the result back to us by mail. That was before the 1990's.\n \n% PP: Your relation to software had changed at the time because you did not have to do all this manipulations with the software your received. Was it already floppy discs?\n% JH: No, magnetic tapes, for the mainframe at least. Even most of the mini-computers used some (cheaper) magnetic tapes. Between 1990 and 1995 the main machines used for Unix software development was a VAX from DEC. Once a year the software came from Berkeley. It was still Unix but had been modified by Berkeley for virtual memory and all the stuff which is common now. We received a tape, with lot of goodies, I still remember we didn't know what was on the tape  but we scrutinized it  to find out what was on there, what we could use...\nIn Europe, companies like Siemens were trying to set up software centers to make software avaiable. They were even trying to set up European networks. But researchers loved the Internet. It worked. It was useful for their research. So companies in Europe were trying to set up their own networks, I remember for example the X/OPEN transport protocol, which was a set of standards about what software layers should do. But it didn't succeed because around 1992 IBM decided to quit their own private network and to go for TCP/IP which was the switching point. \nEverything done for X/OPEN were suddently forgotten. For the mainframes, and certainly in Belgium computing was mainly mainframes, I'm talking about universities here, so when IBM decided to go for TCP/IP the universities followed. \nBut the adoption of TCP/IP was really slow. For example, Belgacom was not interested in running the Domain Name System so we did it here, for some time, starting in 1993 with [Pierre Verbaten](https://www.dnsbelgium.be/en/history). Belgacom were focused on X25 (DCS - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X.25) so they missed it.\n\n% PP: It was like the french Minitel?\n% JH: Well, at that time we were really jealous about Minitel. Could you imagine that? Terminals?  At home? You could work home with a computer! You could send emails! All in one, a PC computer with a modem! \n\n% PP: How did the research about software evolve in the department?\n% JH: I am mainly talking about network research but here. There were people working on numerical analysis, computing, artificial intelligence. I was just not involved in that research so I don't know much about it \n\n% PP: You were focused on software and networks?\n% JH: Yes, we produced some software. We made software to generate compilers. There was some A.I. software in Prolog, numerical analysis libraries, etc. Some were sold or shared, it depends.  \nWe sold some software from the beginning I think when it was not even a department but a professor and a couple of students.\n\n% PP: Is that when you joined?\n% JH: No it was already a department. I studied industrial engeneering in electronics first. At the time in electronics you heard something about computers, I was interested in it. I wanted to know more. I heard Kuleuven had started a\n% year before a\ndegree in computer engeneering. It was the first year where industrial engineers could join. The only thing we knew about computers were from movies. I wanted to know how they worked. I'm not sure if I know now it now, but I have some ideas.\n\n% PP: How many languages do you know?\n% JH: Assembly, FORTRAN, PL-1 the language invented by IBM to be the universal one, C, Cobol. Perl...I don't know...some more. I'm not fluent in any computer language, but I can read any language especially well written, I know I can understand it and, if needed, learn it... I know JAVA also. As a system administrator, the thing I use most are the command line of UNIX and Perl. But that's because i'm more familiar with those two so it goes faster.\n\n% PP: How did you see the rise of personnal computer and the software that goes with?\n% JH: I have to admit that we missed it. We didn't see the new thing was powerful because it was available for everybody.  We were not impressed by the software. I remember windows 95, the news on TV, people sleeping on the street to get it. I remember when I got my first windows version, with a box of 22 floppies or so. Then I wanted to do something, to compile a program, but there was no compiler. We were used to Unix, which was a basic system but haa lot of utilities in it. Software was for us free, and we were used to having it be free, and on a PC it was not free anymore. \n\n% PP: Does that mean you didn't had a personal computer until late?\n% JH: Yes. I think it was round 2000. I didn't need it really. I got one when the Belgian UUCP network became commercial. Of course I did not get Windows on it. I think we got Linux here in 1994. There was a guy involved in the kernel studying here. So we did used it very fast.\n\n% PP: So, what is software for you?\n% JH: For me, software is the magic that makes computer usable. I can only gives examples of what I mean by it. A PC without software- most people, even computer scientists, can't do anything with it. You need basic software. Some software is already integrated in the computer hardware. It is the same for phones, tablets. The main characteristic, for me, is that it should be user friendly. That is very difficult I know, because you have to imagine what the people using your software are going to do with it and how they want to use it. That's the magic you need to solve.\n\n% PP: Is command line user friendly?\n% JH: Well, somehow you have to learn the Unix command language; it is in fact a computer language where you can make all the constructs that other languages offers.\nYou can create loops, you can test, whatever. It's not so different from computer languages like C or JAVA or whatever. It is certainly programmer friendly.\n\n% PP: But it's already software, no? User friendly depends on what you put behind these words, no?\n% JH: Yes it's already software. I don't have a strong opinion about command lines. It depends on people. I can imagine that someone that has never heard about the command line expects that you click somewhere and it happens. But if you know the command language it's sometimes perhaps easier or productive to type commands and let it run. Sometimes, I find it easier if I have a screen and a number of buttons and I don't have to imagine what happens behind that screen. And sometimes I want to do something with the command line, because I'm used to it. That's why I don't trust myself about user friendliness because I have a long experience in computer interfaces. I'm so used to some of them perhaps I can't even imagine that somebody else would like to do it otherwise or doesn't like what I'm used to.\n\n% PP: Apart from maintaining the museum, what do you work on? You are still active in the department even though you are retired?\n% JH: I work on sensors, in the Internet of Things world in one of the university spin-offs. What I do for them is: wireless sensors need power, most of them are on batteries. They have designed a complete system which should make the battery last for two, three, four years. They need a system to measure that. So I have been working on a mechanism to measure that without waiting four years. That's programming instrumentation computers to measure e.g. power or whatever. Most of it on Unix systems. \nThere are enough new or unknown things and maybe because I'm older, I have another way of looking at things, so we have a lot of discussions. They don't like my Perl, they use python, JAVA and those things... Perl, it has its disadvantages, but you can do a lot of things. Every character has a meaning, that makes Perl programs often unreadable.\nWith Python, you need all those libraries... It's easy when you know the libraries, what you have to call. When you know the arguments of the librairies. So it's also complicated. And if the library changes for some reasons, there you go.\nIn my humble opinion it's the same with all the languages. It starts easy from scratch but if you have to interface them with existing things from the Internet world or whatever it gets complicated.\n\n% PP: Do you have a last word?\n% JH: I was surprised by your group reaction to the visit. I thought all of this was known. Maybe I'm getting old :)\n% CARLINSAYS:Do we want to include the smiley face or was that just an impulse during the transcription?\nCurrently I don't do much about the museum department, but sometimes I like to talk about the little stories about it. I remember a lot of little stories, a lot of techniques that  have been used and forgotten, and some techniques that have been kept alive. I thought when I was young that the best techniques would succeed. That you would have visionary people who would see the way. But I realized that a lot of things happen by accident.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","attribs":"*7|1+1*7+a*7*3+p*7|1+1*g|1+1*f+2*7+1*f|1+2y*f+2v*g|1+1*6|1+1*h+6*5+1u*f*5+3*5+12*f*5+8*5+h*6|1+1*5+1j*f*5+7*5+2c*7|1+1*f+1*7+1*f+1n*6|1+1*h+6+9*f+1+1o*d+n+1y*f+1+18*f+1+10*d+1+3e*f+1+o*h+1+1t*h+1+1b*6|2+2+l*j+5+31*j+3+q*6|1+1|1+1*h+6*f*5+4*5+c*j*5+1*5+g*6|1+1*h+6+l*h+1+16*e+1+17*f+2+1a*7|1+2*j+2x*7|1+1+2*f+2+1e*d+2+3a*h|1+2*h*e+2*e+k+1*h|1+1+1j*6|2+2+1h*f+5+d*j+1+4*j+1+10*7+1*0+k+44*7+1*0+l+2y*6|2+2+e*f+1+3r*j+b+b*j+1+24*7|1+1*j+i*7|1+1+27*f+1+p*d+1+q*f+1+d*d+1+3j*6|2+2+t*f+6+14*f+2+49*d+8+15*6|2+2*h+6*5+l*j*5+8*5+d*6|1+1*h+6+t*h+1+h*d+1+m*j+4+17*d+6+1y*6|2+2*h+6*5+13*6|1+1*h+6+2p*d+1+3f*d+8*j+8+5*j+4+b*j+5+3*d+1+1*j+3+y*j+1+6*7|1+2*j+27+1*j+9*7|1+1+2*d+1+2*d+l+9*d+2a*7|1+1*7*e+2*e+14*7|1+1+18*d+1+b*j+3+h*j+1+g*d+u+1*6|2+2*h+6*5+1n*6|1+1*h+6+c*d+1+6*f+2+9*f+1+7*f+1+s*d+1+8*f+3+1k*d+a+9*d+1+1*d+1+r*d+u+1*d+n+e*d*e+4*e+8+1c*h+1+g*d+1+2*d+1+s*d+4+h*d|1+1+2r*d+9+1l*0+1+g*j+2+2c*d+3+24*j+2+z*6|1+1+41*6|2+2*h+6*5+15*6|1+1*h+6+i*f+1+7*f+1+3s*d+4+x*6|2+2*h+6*5+1r*f*5+1*5+z*6|1+1*h+6+8*f+1+5*j+2+l*j+3+1v*j+2*7|1+1*7*e+2*e+3*7|1+1+d*7|1+2*j+1i*7|1+1+2q*j+6+1j*j+6+m*d+9+f*d|1+1+f*d+1+x*j+6+13*d+1+7*d+1+9*d+1+t*d+2+w*d+6+e*d+e+2*d+2+r*d+m+g*d+9+p*h|1+1*h*e+2*e+i*h|1+1+3q*6|2+2*h+6*5+w*j*5+1*5+a*j*5+2*5+2*6|1+1*h+6+1h*j+a+u*j+1+15*j+3+9*0+1+f*0+2+4*d+a+1g*d+n+7*j+1+r*d+2*h+1*d+1+3z*d+1+15*d+3+6*j+2+19*j+1+8*d+6+9*j+1+4*j+1+a*d+4+f*d+1+1c*j+2+4*d+1+j*d+c+2*j+1+c*j+3+b*j+5+1*d+h+7*d+11+p*0+i*h+1*0+9*h+2*0+2a*h+1+1e*j+1+5*d+2+3e*d+4*7|1+2*j+1o*6|1+1+9*j+3+g*0+1*h+2*0+d*h+1*0+11+1*0+38+2q*0+4+2*0+s*j+5*0+1l*7|1+1*7*e+2*0*e+s*e+3*j*e+1*e+2*j*e+8*e+1e*j+1*7|1+1*j+33*7|1+1*h+2*0+u*j+2*0+1i*h+1*0+a*j+5*0+2d*j+1*0+n*j+1*0+9b*d|1+1*d+1+1j*j+2*d+1+1y*0+1*d|1+1+d*d+t+1*j+3+4*d+5+1*d+2+1*d+l+1*d+c+k*d+p+13*d+1+n*j+7+x*d+9+1n*j+1+4*d+p+1q*h+1*d+p+c*d+6+7*0|2+2*h+6*5+17*j*5+5*5+a*j*5+2*0|1+1*h+6+1i*h+1+2f*0+4+10*h+1+25*j+1+1n*h+1+1l*j+1*7|1+1*j+59*0|2+2*h+6*j+5*5+k*j*5+1*5+2q*j*5+1*5+3*j*5+g*5+q*j*5+4*5+11*j*5+1*0|1+1*h+6+i*d+1+1*d+2+1l*j+6+g*d+7+1*0|1+1*d+2+d*j+1+11*d+7+d*d+6+z*d+1+11*d+1+1*2+e*d*2+1*2+e*d*2+1*2+b+5n*j+2+q*j+5+m*j+3+u*j+3+1*d+19*j+3*d+9+2*0|1+1+1*0|1+1*h+6*5+w*j*5+1*5+t*0|1+1*h+6+n*h+1+15*d+1+2*j+4+d*d+4*j+5*7+1+c*j+1+1*j+3+13*d+2*j+5+1*d+6+d*h+1+2u*h+1+h*7+2*j+5+f*j+3+c*j+1+4l*d|1+1+31*j+3+p*j+1+k*j+1+x*j+3+3i*d|1+1+1h*d+8+m*d+o+m*d+b+10*j+a+d*j+1+8*j+g+f*j+1+a*j+1+r*j+2*d+m*j+1*d+1f*j+1*d+w+r*0|1+1+1*0|1+1*h+6*5+4l*0|1+1*h+6+1c*d+6+q*j+5+5*d+1+6*d+2+p*j+2+7*j+2+l*d+5+4*d+5+9*d+c+1r*j+3+l*j+9+1s*j+2+1i*h+1+1a*d+6+g*j+1+1*j+1+1*d+3+4*j+8+a*d+3+g*j+4+5*d+2*0|1+1+2q*j+3+v*d+9+a*d+5+f*j+1+d*j+1+1*j+1+8*j+3+1j*j+1+16*h+1+1e*j+9+6*j+4+1d*j+1+1*j+1+t*d+b+1o*j+1+7*j+5+q*d|1+1+3n*h+1+20*j+4+1*j+1*d+c+6*j+2*d+1+1*d|1+1*d+9*j+7*d+s+3n*h+1+f*h+1+3m*0|2+2*h+6*5+v*0|1+1*h+6+4w*j+2+o*0|2+2*h+6*5+15*j*5+1*5+j*0|1+1*h+6+1f*d+3+2a*j+1+u*j+2+d*h+1+q*0|2+2*h+6*5+14*j*5+2*0|1+1*h+6+f*j+1+j*j+5+u*j+1+1*j+1+1v*j+6+14*0|1+1+3*j+4+f*j+4+f*h+1+2a*0|2+2*h+6*5+3*j*5+4*5+h*0|1+1*h+6+y*j+7+12*j+6+x*j+5+s*h+1+l*h+1+1*h+1+u*d+8*j+1+d*h|1+1*h*e+2*e+d*h|1+1+27*d+1+1e*j+1+6*d+4+u*j+4+5*j+2+g*d+4+9*d+e+g*0|2+2*h+6*5+d*h*5+1*5+3*j*5+1*5+d*0|1+1*h+6+w*h+1+1n*j+3*h+1+b*j+3+2*d+3+s*d+8+5*h+1+9*h+1+i*h+1+t*d+2+4*h+1*d+1+m*d+a*h+1*d+2+b*h+1+17*j+1+a*d+2+3b*0|2+2*h+6*5+27*0|1+1*h+6+1f*d+2+4*d+6+c*d+9*j+7*d+p+3s*h+1+2*j+1+1u*h+1+21*j+1+m*j+a+j*j+2+23*j+3+1*j+5+5*j+2+4*d+5*j+3+p*0|2+2*h+6*5+1p*0|1+1*h+6+24*j+1+8*d+1+14*h+1+41*0|2+2*h+6*5+t*0|1+1*h+6+6*j+1+w*j+1+1g*h+1+y*j+2+2x*d+3+19*j+b+o*j+1+2k*h+1+3e*j+3+y*0|2+2*h+6*5+u*0|1+1*h+6+10*d+5+c*h+1+3*d+4+r*h+1+1l*h+1+c*0|1+1+2e*h+1+w*d+11*0|2+2*h+6*5+p*h*5+1*5+1u*0|1+1*h+6+3q*h+1+16*h+1+22*h+1+2k*h+1+j*h+1+17*h+1+1y*h+1+1h*h+1+q*h+1+1g*h+1+2c*h+1+2i*h+1+b*0|2+2*h+6*5+3f*0|1+1*h+6+q*j+1+b*j+1+19*j+1+7*h+1+f*d+1+a*d+8+c*d+5+4l*d+6+3f*d+1+5*d+5+h*d+1+1*d+e+e*d|1+1+1l*h+1+a*h+1+3c*d+4*h+1+c*j+2*d+1+l*h+1+7*j+1+b*d+2+i*d+9+n*d+d*j+1*d|1+v+18*h+1+11*d+4*h+1*d+2+1s*h+1*j+1+q*h+1+n*d+1+w*d|1+1+1g*h+1+2f*d+1+a*j+1+1a*0|2+2*h+6*5+o*0|1+1*h+6+24*d+2+e*h+1+h*7|1+1*j+2w*7|1+1+3*h+1+6*h+1+1m*h+1+2s*j+4+1*j+6+s*j+1+9*j+q+s*h+1+37*h+1+t*d+2+j*0|1+1*6|3+3*0|1+1*j|1+1|1+1"}}},"pad:observatory.guide.jeanhuensitvextended:revs:10901":{"changeset":"Z:g3y>1|1=1*7|1+1$\n","meta":{"author":"a.PRabeGfk5jCXUq8V","timestamp":1520333706266}},"pad:observatory.guide.jeanhuensitvextended:revs:10902":{"changeset":"Z:g3z>1|2=2*7|1+1$\n","meta":{"author":"a.PRabeGfk5jCXUq8V","timestamp":1520333706827}},"pad:observatory.guide.jeanhuensitvextended:revs:10903":{"changeset":"Z:g40>t*7+t$%

__NOPUBLISH__\n\n\n**You have been using computers since a long time, as you explained us during the tour we had the joy of assisting during the TGSO.**\n**I heard that that until recently, let's say the late 1990's, when learning computer programming you had to start by  writing down the program on paper... ** \n\nIn 1973, i did study computer sciences, it was the second year of the department, here in Leuven. At the time computers were mainframes and you did fed them with programms by punch cards. Programing was writing down the program, than you punched it and the next day you get results, mostly error. That's the way it worked at that time. To teach us programing, they used the langage of that time, Fortran and some kind of invented assembly langage, it didn't really exist, it was simplified.\n\nMost of the time you did write down your program, the teacher and the assistant would have to tell you what is wrong or good, you didn't had much practical experience.\n\n**How was it like, tons of pages ?** \n\nNo. As an anecdocte, i remember punchcards were a block of papers, we were jealous of the people who came in the computer center with huge stacks of cards. That were really small programs, not complicated one. The fact you had to learn to use the computer from scratch, everything was new, you couldn't rely on previous experiences, everything was new. And to start with small programs was difficult enough. \n\nThat was also the time when Edsger W. Dijkstra who forked the goto... i still remember him, in an audience, giving us a lecture on modernisation in programming at the International computing symposium 1977 in Liège (programming: from craft to scientific discipline https://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/EWD/transcriptions/EWD05xx/EWD566.html). He told usxx (i'll complete it as soon as possible. i need Jean's input)\"\n\nAnd then from 75 on, computers became cheaper and could be bought by departments and smaller entities. And than came the first interactive computer. Still beasts about two cubic meters, costing two millions belgian francs. But it was low enough to allow people to type in directly commands. I started working here in 75 as a researcher, it have evolved continuously and i saw computer getting cheaper and getting easier to use.The way to use it was simplified, you could start to go to the beast and try it out.\n\nI remember more or less: you did write down the program in Fortran for instance… We always thought in the beginning that it would work and it didn't, so after a turn around you were giving it back to the operator and you have to wait half a day or a night to get the results.\n\n**What kind of program you were working on?** \n\nI remember the first program i had to write was you got three numbers, you had to make the program decide if you construct a triangle with the numbers being the sides of the triangle.\n\n**That took an afternoon to be processed ?** \n\nWell, yeah. You had to imagine how to do it which was also one problem, than you prepare the card with the punching machine and you give the package of cards to the operator who was feeeding the computer with the cards. People had the taks to fed the computers by hands, with paper, cards, than disks and it lasts onto the magnetic disks period. And after a number of hours or a night you get a listing, a piece of paper, with the results.\n\n**When where you able to record the program onto the machine?**\n\nI think that happens between 75 and 80. After the punching cards which was already a way to record the program, we had  typewriters, terminals but we could record the programs, we could store them on the computer. We had magnetic discs. IBM had number for everything, i remember the 33-30 [manufactured from 1970 on] had a magnetic disk. We didn't touch the machines, operators would change the disks, we could only access the typewriter. That was our most direct connexion to the computer. Thetimes were diffent. The mainframes were such huge costly beasts that it had operators day and night keeping it busy. Even at night there were two or three guys mounting tapes, dismounting tapes, that kind of stuff.\nhttps://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/42/IBM_magnetic_disk_drives_3330%2B3333.png/600px-IBM_magnetic_disk_drives_3330%2B3333.png\n\n**When did you stop working with operators?** \n\nSomewhere between 85 and 90. There were still operators at the main computer of the university, but there were also small computers, so researchers and student can have direct access when needed. \n\n**When did you start to work with software sold by others or gived away in order to do your research?** \n\nYou stil need an operating system on the mainframe that was delivered by IBM or the constructor delivering the mainframe. When you bought mini-computers, which were the  smaller versions of mainframes, in most cases you did buy an operating systems, compilers and all the stuff you need to be able to program those things. In most cases, because the computer sciences department did buy the mini-computer from, for instance *digital equipment corporation*,  a manufactorer of that time, but they didn't buy their software. They were not open source or free,  but you could get Unix and could run it on those digital equipment (DEC) computers. That is what the computer department of the University of Louvain la Neuve *l'unité d'informatique*, did and so did we.\n\n**When did you start working with unix as an os?** \n\nI took a trip to Amsterdam, it must have been in 1979/80… Well, the story starts in our french sister university (LLN) where they did have a PDP-11 with Unix on it https://hackadaycom.files.wordpress.com/2016/08/full-size-pdp11.jpg. You got Unix, at the time, when you were a university, from Bell Aps (Ma Bell), the american telephone company. It was a mega organisation at the time [before the [dismantlment of AT&T/Bell system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breakup_of_the_Bell_System)].Due to monopoly, the US authorities splitted up in different Baby Bells. One of the restriction was there was a research baby bell, they couldn't really sell anything.There were computer scientists there, who did developped some Unix interesting things.  For universities you did get the source and no support for free. How to install it, no idea. In Unité d'informatique, they were lucky: they got the same computer that unix were developped on.  They got the disk by snail mail as a post-office package. They mounted it and it did spin up and they had it.\nHere, we did have a cheaper PDP11 (DEC - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PDP-11) We go the disk source from Bell Aps but we could not run it. We could look at it but that was all, because our disc format was different than the one at Bell Aps. Somebody here did write a driver for that disk and we did compiled it in l'unité d'informatique of LLN.  it did compile it but we couldn't try it because we did not have So we find the nearest Unix system compatiblewith ours, it was in Amsterdam.  Andrew Tenebaum who did write since then a number of books about operating systems and became quite an authority. He was working there. It was the young Tanenbaum, just arriving from United States to Amsterdam. He was learning to speak dutch. We did understood his english better but his assistant insisted that he speaks dutch because he will have to pass an exam in dutch. There we got a disk, than also the one with the driver we compiled, than we got here and we start using Unix.  Than in my opinion the start of open source was Unix because we had to maintain it by ourselves and we learned a lot from the sources.\nIn that time we did had to get soft\n\n\n\n\n\n","attribs":"|1+g*6|2+2*5+3p*6|1+1*5+4f*6|2+2+dm*6|2+2+4n*6|1+1|1+1*5+11*6|2+2+bc*6|2+2+5z*2+3e*3+1*4*3+20*4+1*6|2+2+e7*6|2+2+7n*6|2+2*5+1a*6|2+2+53*6|2+2*5+19*6|2+2+c7*6|2+2*5+1r*6|2+2+jo*6|1+1+41*6|2+2*5+1a*6|2+2+5g*6|2+2*5+2w*6|2+2+l6*6|2+2*5+1f*6|2+2+8f*5+7+kh*6|1+1+uu*0|1+1*0+z*6|5+5|1+1"}}},"pad:observatory.guide.jeanhuensitvextended:revs:11000":{"changeset":"Z:g8m<1|1z=7mi=58-1$","meta":{"author":"a.Yuc89brzNTYjBp89","timestamp":1522595495216,"atext":{"text":"%__NOPUBLISH__\n% SHOW: tgsoimages.svg jean H\n\n\n% HEADER: Interview with Jean Huens\n\n(% CARLINSAYS: Peggy can you fill in the when and where for this intro and add or change it as you see fit?)\nThe following is a transcript of an interview with Jean Huens conducted by Peggy at X date and Y place.\n\n% PP: You have been using computers since a long time, as you explained to us during the tour we had the joy of attending during the TGSO.\nI heard that until recently, let's say the late 1990s, that to learn computer programming you had to start by writing down the program on paper...\n% CARLINSAYS: I want to put a period or a question mark here? FS: go for it :-)\n% JH: In 1973, I did study computer sciences, it was the second year of the Computer Sciense course, here in Leuven. At the time computers were mainframes and you did feed them with programs by punch cards. Programming was writing down the program, then you punched it and the next day you get results, mostly error. That's the way it worked at that time. To teach us programming, they used the language of that time, Fortran and some kind of invented assembly language, it didn't really exist, it was simplified.\n\nMost of the time you wrote down your program, the teacher and the assistant would have to tell you what is wrong or good, you didn't have much practical experience.\n\n% PP: What was it like, tons of pages? \n% JH: No. As an anecdocte, I remember punchcards were a block of papers, we were jealous of the people who came into the computer center with huge stacks of cards.\n% CARLINSAYS: The \"block of papers\" is a little confusing. Could we say \"punchcards came in huge stacks\"? FS: YES\nThey were really small programs, not complicated one. In fact you had to learn to use the computer from scratch, everything was new, you couldn't rely on previous experiences.\n% , everything was new.\nAnd to start with small programs was difficult enough. \n\nThat was also the time when Edsger W. Dijkstra, who fought against the \"goto\" and other common but bad constructs.[@dijksra:1972:goto] I still remember him, in an audience, giving us a lecture on good  techniques in programming at the International computing symposium 1977 in Liège.[@dijksra:1977:craft] It was a rather hard course because Dijkstra expected you to quickly  understand and implement his ideas.\n\nAnd then from '75 on, computers became cheaper and could be bought by departments and smaller entities. And than came the first interactive computer. They were still beasts, about two cubic meters, costing two millions belgian francs. But it was low\n% CARLINSAYS: low? FS: guess: cheap enough\nenough to allow people to type in directly commands. I started working here in '75 as a researcher, it has evolved continuously and I saw computers getting cheaper and getting easier to use.The way to use it was simplified, you could start to go to the beast and try it out.\n\nI remember more or less: you wrote down the program in Fortran for instance. We always thought in the beginning that it would work and it didn't, so after a turn around you were giving it back to the operator and you have to wait another half a day or a night to get the results.\n\n% PP: What kind of program were you working on? \n% JH: I remember the first program I had to write was: you got three numbers and you had to make the program decide if you could construct a triangle with the numbers being the sides of the triangle.\n\n% PP: That took an afternoon to be processed?\n% JH: Well, yeah. You had to imagine how to do it which was also one problem, than you prepare the cards with the punching machine and you give the package of cards to the operator who was feeding the computer with the cards. Operators were people who had the task of feeding the computers by hand, with paper, cards,\n% CARLINSAYS: are these paper cards or paper and then cards because the two are separate? FS: guess it should be either paper or cards or paper cards\nthen cards got written on disks and later processed by the mainframe from disk. Finally results got printed on paper.\n% it lasts onto the magnetic disks period.\nAnd after a number of hours or a night you got a listing on a piece of paper with the results or program compilation errors.\n\n% PP: When where you able to record the program onto the machine?\n% JH: I think that happened between '75 and '80. After the punching cards, which were already a way to record the program, we had typewriters and then terminals. We could record the programs by typing it on the terminal  and the computer would store them on disk. We had magnetic discs. IBM had number for everything, I remember the 3300  [manufactured from 1970 on] was a magnetic disk. \nWe didn't touch the machines, operators would change the disks, we could only access the typewriter/terminal. That was our most direct connexion to the computer. The times were different. The mainframes were such huge costly beasts that it had operators day and night to keep it busy. Even at night there were two or three guys mounting tapes, disc mounting tapes, that kind of stuff.\nhttps://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/42/IBM_magnetic_disk_drives_3330%2B3333.png/600px-IBM_magnetic_disk_drives_3330%2B3333.png\n\n% PP: When did you stop working with operators?\n% JH: Somewhere between '85 and '90. There were still operators at the main computer of the university, but there were also small computers, so researchers and student could have direct access when needed. \n\n% PP: When did you start to work with software sold by others or given away in order to do your research?\n% JH: You still needed an operating system for the mainframe that was delivered by IBM or the constructor delivered\n% ing\nthe mainframe.\n% CARLINSAYS: does this make sense with these changes?\nWhen you bought mini-computers, which were the  smaller versions of mainframes, in most cases you bought an operating systems, compilers and all the stuff you needed to be able to program or work  those things. \nIn most cases,  the computer sciences department bought the mini-computer from, for instance *Digital Equipment Corporation*,  a manufactorer at that time, but they didn't buy DEC's  software. The DEC software  was not open source or free,  and as a university we could get Unix for free and could run it on those\n% digital equipment \nDEC computers. That is what the computer department of the University of Louvain la Neuve *l'unité d'informatique*, did and so did we.\n\n% PP: When did you start working with Unix as an OS? \n% JH: I took a trip to Amsterdam, it must have been in 1979 or 1980. Well, the story starts in our French sister university (LLN) where they had a PDP-11 with Unix on it. You could get Unix, at the time, when you were a university, from Bell Labs (part of AT&T), the American telephone company. AT&T was a mega organisation at the time [before the [dismantlment of AT&T/Bell system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breakup_of_the_Bell_System). Due to monopoly, the US authorities split it up into different Baby Bells. One of the restrictions was that the research Baby Bell, could not sell anything. There were computer scientists there who developed some interesting things (e.g. Unix). Universities got the source code for free, but NO support, nothing not even how to install it. In Unité d'informatique, where they had a [PDP-11/70](https://i0.wp.com/www.utterpower.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/pdp11-70-panel.jpg) they were lucky: they got the same computer that Unix was developed on.  They got the disk by snail mail as a post-office package. They mounted it and it did spin up and they had UNIX.\n% CARLINSAYS: is there a reason this is all capital letters? FS Unix\nHere, we had a cheaper PDP11, [the PDP 11/60](https://dave.cheney.net/tag/pdp-11). We got the Unix disk distribution from Bell Labs but we could not run it, because we got another type of disk(RK07). We could look at it but that was all, because our disc format was different than the one at Bell Labs. Somebody here (P.Verbaeten) wrote a driver for that disk in l'unité d'informatique of LLN.\n% But they did not have a RK07.  It compiled it but we couldn't try it because we did not have \n% CARLINSAYS: I think this should read \"It compiled it but we couldn't try it because we did not have a RKO7\"? FS: yes\nThe nearest place with Unix and a RK07 was in Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam.  Andrew Tenenbaum, who wrote a number of books on operating systems, was working there. He was learning to speak Dutch. We understood hisEnglish better but his assistant explained that he needed to practice speaking Dutch because he would have to pass an exam. There we compiled Unix with an RK07 driver and stored it on a bootable RK07 disk. With that disk back in Leuven we could start Unix on our PDP11/60. An error in the process meant a trip Leuven-Amsterdam and back.\nIn my opinion the start of open source was Unix because we had to maintain it by ourselves and we learned a lot from the sources. \nIn that time for software distribution you had to store it on magnetic tape and send the tape to different places with associated problems. For example, the agents at the customs at the airport or post office didn't know what to do with the tapes or discs in terms of custom clearance. They used magnetic or x-rays as inspection tools and we had to write on the package that it should not be x-rayed. And sometimes we still got unreadable tapes/discs. \n\n% PP: So it took weeks between the transportation and the customs?\n% JH: Yes, the custom had to clear the packages. I remember I've been in the customs in Zaventem. I had received a letter that my package from Bell Labs had arrived. I went there thinking I would have to pay something and go. But no. It had to be cleared so there was some organisation that had to do administrative stuff, so I only got it a few days later. The response time was huge.\n% CARLINSAYS: This is a nice idiosyncratic pharse so maybe we leave it even if it is a bit hard to understand? I think it means it took a long time for things to be shipped back and forth)\n\n% PP: After that period of time, how did you switch from that kind of collaboration on how to make software and make software work, to another kind of collaboration on networks and between universities and researchers?\n% JH: In the Unix systems at that time there was a kind of networking protocol which worked on serial lines (UUCP).\nTo connect two Unix systems together you only need a serial line. We had a line between LLN and Leuven, it's only 25 kms, but we had to ask Belgacom, then La Régie des Télégraphes et Téléphones, to get a modem to connect through their network and than over that modem you could reach an amazing speed of 300 characters per second. And that was the first communication. It happened somewhere around 1985. And then you had connection with another computer by writing something here and doing the transfer to the other computer and executing it there. \n \n% PP: What was the first thing you sent through a network like this?\n% JH: I didn't do it myself, I remember it was a kind of chat program. On the LLN side was Professor Elie Milgrom. He is retired now. On this side, it was Professor  Yves Willems. And I remember that they typed something and they got a response from the other side and that was it.  But I remember that Professor Willems sent \"Ok, we stop now.\" And that Elie Milgrom answered \"See you later, Alligator\" [a reference to Bill Haley and the Comets]. At the time we still had these kind of songs in mind. (lol). \nThose Unix to Unix connexions were first. And there was a worldwide Unix to Unix based network, Usenet (1979). It still exists somewhere.You can download loads of illegal movies and that stuff. That was not what we meant at the time. But that is what is left. And Usenet became gradually replaced by the Internet in USA. \nIn Europe, the Internet came a lot later, but we had limited access to the Internet by mail and even FTP; We could send mail to the Internet and we could receive mail from them because some friendly American university (and later companiesI translated internet mail to UCP mail. Moreover they translated specially formatted mails into FTP request and sent the result back to us by mail. That was before the 1990's.\n \n% PP: Your relation to software had changed at the time because you did not have to do all this manipulations with the software your received. Was it already floppy discs?\n% JH: No, magnetic tapes, for the mainframe at least. Even most of the mini-computers used some (cheaper) magnetic tapes. Between 1990 and 1995 the main machines used for Unix software development was a VAX from DEC. Once a year the software came from Berkeley. It was still Unix but had been modified by Berkeley for virtual memory and all the stuff which is common now. We received a tape, with lot of goodies, I still remember we didn't know what was on the tape  but we scrutinized it  to find out what was on there, what we could use...\nIn Europe, companies like Siemens were trying to set up software centers to make software avaiable. They were even trying to set up European networks. But researchers loved the Internet. It worked. It was useful for their research. So companies in Europe were trying to set up their own networks, I remember for example the X/OPEN transport protocol, which was a set of standards about what software layers should do. But it didn't succeed because around 1992 IBM decided to quit their own private network and to go for TCP/IP which was the switching point. \nEverything done for X/OPEN were suddently forgotten. For the mainframes, and certainly in Belgium computing was mainly mainframes, I'm talking about universities here, so when IBM decided to go for TCP/IP the universities followed. \nBut the adoption of TCP/IP was really slow. For example, Belgacom was not interested in running the Domain Name System so we did it here, for some time, starting in 1993 with [Pierre Verbaten](https://www.dnsbelgium.be/en/history). Belgacom were focused on X25 (DCS - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X.25) so they missed it.\n\n% PP: It was like the french Minitel?\n% JH: Well, at that time we were really jealous about Minitel. Could you imagine that? Terminals?  At home? You could work home with a computer! You could send emails! All in one, a PC computer with a modem! \n\n% PP: How did the research about software evolve in the department?\n% JH: I am mainly talking about network research but here. There were people working on numerical analysis, computing, artificial intelligence. I was just not involved in that research so I don't know much about it \n\n% PP: You were focused on software and networks?\n% JH: Yes, we produced some software. We made software to generate compilers. There was some A.I. software in Prolog, numerical analysis libraries, etc. Some were sold or shared, it depends.  \nWe sold some software from the beginning I think when it was not even a department but a professor and a couple of students.\n\n% PP: Is that when you joined?\n% JH: No it was already a department. I studied industrial engeneering in electronics first. At the time in electronics you heard something about computers, I was interested in it. I wanted to know more. I heard Kuleuven had started a\n% year before a\ndegree in computer engeneering. It was the first year where industrial engineers could join. The only thing we knew about computers were from movies. I wanted to know how they worked. I'm not sure if I know now it now, but I have some ideas.\n\n% PP: How many languages do you know?\n% JH: Assembly, FORTRAN, PL-1 the language invented by IBM to be the universal one, C, Cobol. Perl...I don't know...some more. I'm not fluent in any computer language, but I can read any language especially well written, I know I can understand it and, if needed, learn it... I know JAVA also. As a system administrator, the thing I use most are the command line of UNIX and Perl. But that's because i'm more familiar with those two so it goes faster.\n\n% PP: How did you see the rise of personnal computer and the software that goes with?\n% JH: I have to admit that we missed it. We didn't see the new thing was powerful because it was available for everybody.  We were not impressed by the software. I remember windows 95, the news on TV, people sleeping on the street to get it. I remember when I got my first windows version, with a box of 22 floppies or so. Then I wanted to do something, to compile a program, but there was no compiler. We were used to Unix, which was a basic system but haa lot of utilities in it. Software was for us free, and we were used to having it be free, and on a PC it was not free anymore. \n\n% PP: Does that mean you didn't had a personal computer until late?\n% JH: Yes. I think it was round 2000. I didn't need it really. I got one when the Belgian UUCP network became commercial. Of course I did not get Windows on it. I think we got Linux here in 1994. There was a guy involved in the kernel studying here. So we did used it very fast.\n\n% PP: So, what is software for you?\n% JH: For me, software is the magic that makes computer usable. I can only give examples of what I mean by it. A PC without software- most people, even computer scientists, can't do anything with it. You need basic software. Some software is already integrated in the computer hardware. It is the same for phones, tablets. The main characteristic, for me, is that it should be user friendly. That is very difficult I know, because you have to imagine what the people using your software are going to do with it and how they want to use it. That's the magic you need to solve.\n\n% PP: Is command line user friendly?\n% JH: Well, somehow you have to learn the Unix command language; it is in fact a computer language where you can make all the constructs that other languages offers.\nYou can create loops, you can test, whatever. It's not so different from computer languages like C or JAVA or whatever. It is certainly programmer friendly.\n\n% PP: But it's already software, no? User friendly depends on what you put behind these words, no?\n% JH: Yes it's already software. I don't have a strong opinion about command lines. It depends on people. I can imagine that someone that has never heard about the command line expects that you click somewhere and it happens. But if you know the command language it's sometimes perhaps easier or productive to type commands and let it run. Sometimes, I find it easier if I have a screen and a number of buttons and I don't have to imagine what happens behind that screen. And sometimes I want to do something with the command line, because I'm used to it. That's why I don't trust myself about user friendliness because I have a long experience in computer interfaces. I'm so used to some of them perhaps I can't even imagine that somebody else would like to do it otherwise or doesn't like what I'm used to.\n\n% PP: Apart from maintaining the museum, what do you work on? You are still active in the department even though you are retired?\n% JH: I work on sensors, in the Internet of Things world in one of the university spin-offs. What I do for them is: wireless sensors need power, most of them are on batteries. They have designed a complete system which should make the battery last for two, three, four years. They need a system to measure that. So I have been working on a mechanism to measure that without waiting four years. That's programming instrumentation computers to measure e.g. power or whatever. Most of it on Unix systems. \nThere are enough new or unknown things and maybe because I'm older, I have another way of looking at things, so we have a lot of discussions. They don't like my Perl, they use python, JAVA and those things... Perl, it has its disadvantages, but you can do a lot of things. Every character has a meaning, that makes Perl programs often unreadable.\nWith Python, you need all those libraries... It's easy when you know the libraries, what you have to call. When you know the arguments of the librairies. So it's also complicated. And if the library changes for some reasons, there you go.\nIn my humble opinion it's the same with all the languages. It starts easy from scratch but if you have to interface them with existing things from the Internet world or whatever it gets complicated.\n\n% PP: Do you have a last word?\n% JH: I was surprised by your group reaction to the visit. I thought all of this was known. Maybe I'm getting old :)\n% CARLINSAYS:Do we want to include the smiley face or was that just an impulse during the transcription?\nCurrently I don't do much about the museum department, but sometimes I like to talk about the little stories about it. I remember a lot of little stories, a lot of techniques that  have been used and forgotten, and some techniques that have been kept alive. I thought when I was young that the best techniques would succeed. That you would have visionary people who would see the way. But I realized that a lot of things happen by

SHOW: tgsoimages.svg jean H\n\n\n% HEADER: Interview with Jean Huens\n\n% PP: You have been using computers since a long time, as you explained to us during the tour we had the joy of attending during the TGSO.\nI heard that until recently, let's say the late 1990s, that to learn computer programming you had to start by writing down the program on paper?\n\n% JH: In 1973, I did study computer sciences, it was the second year of the Computer Science course, here in Leuven. At the time computers were mainframes and you did feed them with programs by punch cards. Programming was writing down the program, then you punched it and the next day you get results, mostly error. That's the way it worked at that time. To teach us programming, they used the language of that time, Fortran and some kind of invented assembly language, it didn't really exist, it was simplified.\n\nMost of the time you wrote down your program, the teacher and the assistant would have to tell you what is wrong or good, you didn't have much practical experience.\n\n% PP: What was it like, tons of pages? \n% JH: No. As an anecdocte, I remember punchcards came in huge stacks, we were jealous of the people who came into the computer center with piles of cards.\nThey were really small programs, not complicated one. In fact you had to learn to use the computer from scratch, everything was new, you couldn't rely on previous experiences.\n% , everything was new.\nAnd to start with small programs was difficult enough. \n\nThat was also the time when Edsger W. Dijkstra, who fought against the \"goto\" can this be _goto_? and other common but bad constructs.[@dijksra:1972:goto] I still remember him, in an audience, giving us a lecture on good  techniques in programming at the International computing symposium 1977 in Liège.[@dijksra:1977:craft] It was a rather hard course because Dijkstra expected you to quickly  understand and implement his ideas.\n\nAnd then from '75 on, computers became cheaper and could be bought by departments and smaller entities. And than came the first interactive computer. They were still beasts, about two cubic meters, costing two millions belgian francs. But it was cheap enough to allow people to type in directly commands. I started working here in '75 as a researcher, it has evolved continuously and I saw computers getting cheaper and getting easier to use.The way to use it was simplified, you could start to go to the beast and try it out.\n\nI remember more or less: you wrote down the program in Fortran for instance. We always thought in the beginning that it would work and it didn't, so after a turn around you were giving it back to the operator and you have to wait another half a day or a night to get the results.\n\n% PP: What kind of program were you working on? \n% JH: I remember the first program I had to write was: you got three numbers and you had to make the program decide if you could construct a triangle with the numbers being the sides of the triangle.\n\n% PP: That took an afternoon to be processed?\n% JH: Well, yeah. You had to imagine how to do it which was also one problem, than you prepare the cards with the punching machine and you give the package of cards to the operator who was feeding the computer with the cards. Operators were people who had the task of feeding the computers by hand, with paper cards, and then the cards got written on disks and later processed by the mainframe from disk. Finally results got printed on paper.\n% it lasts onto the magnetic disks period.\nAnd after a number of hours or a night you got a listing on a piece of paper with the results or program compilation errors.\n\n% PP: When where you able to record the program onto the machine?\n% JH: I think that happened between '75 and '80. After the punching cards, which were already a way to record the program, we had typewriters and then terminals. We could record the programs by typing it on the terminal  and the computer would store them on disk. We had magnetic discs. IBM had number for everything, I remember the 3300  [manufactured from 1970 on] was a magnetic disk. \nWe didn't touch the machines, operators would change the disks, we could only access the typewriter/terminal. That was our most direct connexion to the computer. The times were different. The mainframes were such huge costly beasts that it had operators day and night to keep it busy. Even at night there were two or three guys mounting tapes, disc mounting tapes, that kind of stuff.\nhttps://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/42/IBM_magnetic_disk_drives_3330%2B3333.png/600px-IBM_magnetic_disk_drives_3330%2B3333.png\n\n% PP: When did you stop working with operators?\n% JH: Somewhere between '85 and '90. There were still operators at the main computer of the university, but there were also small computers, so researchers and student could have direct access when needed. \n\n% PP: When did you start to work with software sold by others or given away in order to do your research?\n% JH: You still needed an operating system for the mainframe that was delivered by IBM or the constructor delivered the mainframe.\n% CARLINSAYS: does this make sense with these changes?\nWhen you bought mini-computers, which were the  smaller versions of mainframes, in most cases you bought an operating systems, compilers and all the stuff you needed to be able to program or work  those things. \nIn most cases,  the computer sciences department bought the mini-computer from, for instance *Digital Equipment Corporation*,  a manufactorer at that time, but they didn't buy DEC's  software. The DEC software  was not open source or free,  and as a university we could get Unix for free and could run it on thoseDEC computers. That is what the computer department of the University of Louvain la Neuve *l'unité d'informatique*, did and so did we.\n\n% PP: When did you start working with Unix as an OS? \n% JH: I took a trip to Amsterdam, it must have been in 1979 or 1980. Well, the story starts in our French sister university (LLN) where they had a PDP-11 with Unix on it. You could get Unix, at the time, when you were a university, from Bell Labs (part of AT&T), the American telephone company. AT&T was a mega organisation at the time [before the [dismantlment of AT&T/Bell system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breakup_of_the_Bell_System). Due to monopoly, the US authorities split it up into different Baby Bells. One of the restrictions was that the research Baby Bell, could not sell anything. There were computer scientists there who developed some interesting things (e.g. Unix). Universities got the source code for free, but NO support, nothing not even how to install it. In Unité d'informatique, where they had a [PDP-11/70](https://i0.wp.com/www.utterpower.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/pdp11-70-panel.jpg) they were lucky: they got the same computer that Unix was developed on.  They got the disk by snail mail as a post-office package. They mounted it and it did spin up and they had UNIX.\n% CARLINSAYS: is there a reason this is all capital letters? FS Unix\nHere, we had a cheaper PDP11, [the PDP 11/60](https://dave.cheney.net/tag/pdp-11). We got the Unix disk distribution from Bell Labs but we could not run it, because we got another type of disk(RK07). We could look at it but that was all, because our disc format was different than the one at Bell Labs. Somebody here (P.Verbaeten) wrote a driver for that disk in l'unité d'informatique of LLN.\n% But they did not have a RK07.  It compiled it but we couldn't try it because we did not have \n% CARLINSAYS: I think this should read \"It compiled it but we couldn't try it because we did not have a RKO7\"? FS: yes\nThe nearest place with Unix and a RK07 was in Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam.  Andrew Tenenbaum, who wrote a number of books on operating systems, was working there. He was learning to speak Dutch. We understood his English better but his assistant explained that he needed to practice speaking Dutch because he would have to pass an exam. There we compiled Unix with an RK07 driver and stored it on a bootable RK07 disk. With that disk back in Leuven we could start Unix on our PDP11/60. An error in the process meant a trip Leuven-Amsterdam and back.\nIn my opinion the start of Open Source was Unix because we had to maintain it by ourselves and we learned a lot from the sources. \nIn that time for software distribution you had to store it on magnetic tape and send the tape to different places with associated problems. For example, the agents at the customs at the airport or post office didn't know what to do with the tapes or discs in terms of custom clearance. They used magnetic or x-rays as inspection tools and we had to write on the package that it should not be x-rayed. And sometimes we still got unreadable tapes/discs. \n\n% PP: So it took weeks between the transportation and the customs?\n% JH: Yes, the custom had to clear the packages. I remember I've been in the customs in Zaventem. I had received a letter that my package from Bell Labs had arrived. I went there thinking I would have to pay something and go. But no. It had to be cleared so there was some organisation that had to do administrative stuff, so I only got it a few days later. The response time was huge.\n% CARLINSAYS: This is a nice idiosyncratic pharse so maybe we leave it even if it is a bit hard to understand? I think it means it took a long time for things to be shipped back and forth FS: OK!\n\n% PP: After that period of time, how did you switch from that kind of collaboration on how to make software and make software work, to another kind of collaboration on networks and between universities and researchers?\n% JH: In the Unix systems at that time there was a kind of networking protocol which worked on serial lines (UUCP).\nTo connect two Unix systems together you only need a serial line. We had a line between LLN and Leuven, it's only 25 kms, but we had to ask Belgacom, then La Régie des Télégraphes et Téléphones, to get a modem to connect through their network and than over that modem you could reach an amazing speed of 300 characters per second. And that was the first communication. It happened somewhere around 1985. And then you had connection with another computer by writing something here and doing the transfer to the other computer and executing it there. \n \n% PP: What was the first thing you sent through a network like this?\n% JH: I didn't do it myself, I remember it was a kind of chat program. On the LLN side was Professor Elie Milgrom. He is retired now. On this side, it was Professor  Yves Willems. And I remember that they typed something and they got a response from the other side and that was it.  But I remember that Professor Willems sent \"Ok, we stop now.\" And that Elie Milgrom answered \"See you later, Alligator\" [a reference to Bill Haley and the Comets]. At the time we still had these kind of songs in mind. (lol). \nThose Unix to Unix connexions were first. And there was a worldwide Unix to Unix based network, Usenet (1979). It still exists somewhere.You can download loads of illegal movies and that stuff. That was not what we meant at the time. But that is what is left. And Usenet became gradually replaced by the Internet in USA. \nIn Europe, the Internet came a lot later, but we had limited access to the Internet by mail and even FTP; We could send mail to the Internet and we could receive mail from them because some friendly American university (and later companiesI translated internet mail to UCP mail. Moreover they translated specially formatted mails into FTP request and sent the result back to us by mail. That was before the 1990's.\n \n% PP: Your relation to software had changed at the time because you did not have to do all this manipulations with the software your received. Was it already floppy discs?\n% JH: No, magnetic tapes, for the mainframe at least. Even most of the mini-computers used some (cheaper) magnetic tapes. Between 1990 and 1995 the main machines used for Unix software development was a VAX from DEC. Once a year the software came from Berkeley. It was still Unix but had been modified by Berkeley for virtual memory and all the stuff which is common now. We received a tape, with lot of goodies, I still remember we didn't know what was on the tape  but we scrutinized it  to find out what was on there, what we could use...\nIn Europe, companies like Siemens were trying to set up software centers to make software avaiable. They were even trying to set up European networks. But researchers loved the Internet. It worked. It was useful for their research. So companies in Europe were trying to set up their own networks, I remember for example the X/OPEN transport protocol, which was a set of standards about what software layers should do. But it didn't succeed because around 1992 IBM decided to quit their own private network and to go for TCP/IP which was the switching point. \nEverything done for X/OPEN were suddently forgotten. For the mainframes, and certainly in Belgium computing was mainly mainframes, I'm talking about universities here, so when IBM decided to go for TCP/IP the universities followed. \nBut the adoption of TCP/IP was really slow. For example, Belgacom was not interested in running the Domain Name System so we did it here, for some time, starting in 1993 with [Pierre Verbaten](https://www.dnsbelgium.be/en/history). Belgacom were focused on X25 (DCS - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X.25) so they missed it.\n\n% PP: It was like the french Minitel?\n% JH: Well, at that time we were really jealous about Minitel. Could you imagine that? Terminals?  At home? You could work home with a computer! You could send emails! All in one, a PC computer with a modem! \n\n% PP: How did the research about software evolve in the department?\n% JH: I am mainly talking about network research but here. There were people working on numerical analysis, computing, artificial intelligence. I was just not involved in that research so I don't know much about it \n\n% PP: You were focused on software and networks?\n% JH: Yes, we produced some software. We made software to generate compilers. There was some A.I. software in Prolog, numerical analysis libraries, etc. Some were sold or shared, it depends.  \nWe sold some software from the beginning I think when it was not even a department but a professor and a couple of students.\n\n% PP: Is that when you joined?\n% JH: No it was already a department. I studied industrial engeneering in electronics first. At the time in electronics you heard something about computers, I was interested in it. I wanted to know more. I heard Kuleuven had started a\n% year before a\ndegree in computer engeneering. It was the first year where industrial engineers could join. The only thing we knew about computers were from movies. I wanted to know how they worked. I'm not sure if I know now it now, but I have some ideas.\n\n% PP: How many languages do you know?\n% JH: Assembly, FORTRAN, PL-1 the language invented by IBM to be the universal one, C, Cobol. Perl...I don't know...some more. I'm not fluent in any computer language, but I can read any language especially well written, I know I can understand it and, if needed, learn it... I know JAVA also. As a system administrator, the thing I use most are the command line of UNIX and Perl. But that's because i'm more familiar with those two so it goes faster.\n\n% PP: How did you see the rise of personnal computer and the software that goes with?\n% JH: I have to admit that we missed it. We didn't see the new thing was powerful because it was available for everybody.  We were not impressed by the software. I remember windows 95, the news on TV, people sleeping on the street to get it. I remember when I got my first windows version, with a box of 22 floppies or so. Then I wanted to do something, to compile a program, but there was no compiler. We were used to Unix, which was a basic system but haa lot of utilities in it. Software was for us free, and we were used to having it be free, and on a PC it was not free anymore. \n\n% PP: Does that mean you didn't had a personal computer until late?\n% JH: Yes. I think it was round 2000. I didn't need it really. I got one when the Belgian UUCP network became commercial. Of course I did not get Windows on it. I think we got Linux here in 1994. There was a guy involved in the kernel studying here. So we did used it very fast.\n\n% PP: So, what is software for you?\n% JH: For me, software is the magic that makes computer usable. I can only give examples of what I mean by it. A PC without software- most people, even computer scientists, can't do anything with it. You need basic software. Some software is already integrated in the computer hardware. It is the same for phones, tablets. The main characteristic, for me, is that it should be user friendly. That is very difficult I know, because you have to imagine what the people using your software are going to do with it and how they want to use it. That's the magic you need to solve.\n\n% PP: Is command line user friendly?\n% JH: Well, somehow you have to learn the Unix command language; it is in fact a computer language where you can make all the constructs that other languages offers.\nYou can create loops, you can test, whatever. It's not so different from computer languages like C or JAVA or whatever. It is certainly programmer friendly.\n\n% PP: But it's already software, no? User friendly depends on what you put behind these words, no?\n% JH: Yes it's already software. I don't have a strong opinion about command lines. It depends on people. I can imagine that someone that has never heard about the command line expects that you click somewhere and it happens. But if you know the command language it's sometimes perhaps easier or productive to type commands and let it run. Sometimes, I find it easier if I have a screen and a number of buttons and I don't have to imagine what happens behind that screen. And sometimes I want to do something with the command line, because I'm used to it. That's why I don't trust myself about user friendliness because I have a long experience in computer interfaces. I'm so used to some of them perhaps I can't even imagine that somebody else would like to do it otherwise or doesn't like what I'm used to.\n\n% PP: Apart from maintaining the museum, what do you work on? You are still active in the department even though you are retired?\n% JH: I work on sensors, in the Internet of Things world in one of the university spin-offs. What I do for them is: wireless sensors need power, most of them are on batteries. They have designed a complete system which should make the battery last for two, three, four years. They need a system to measure that. So I have been working on a mechanism to measure that without waiting four years. That's programming instrumentation computers to measure e.g. power or whatever. Most of it on Unix systems. \nThere are enough new or unknown things and maybe because I'm older, I have another way of looking at things, so we have a lot of discussions. They don't like my Perl, they use python, JAVA and those things... Perl, it has its disadvantages, but you can do a lot of things. Every character has a meaning, that makes Perl programs often unreadable.\nWith Python, you need all those libraries... It's easy when you know the libraries, what you have to call. When you know the arguments of the librairies. So it's also complicated. And if the library changes for some reasons, there you go.\nIn my humble opinion it's the same with all the languages. It starts easy from scratch but if you have to interface them with existing things from the Internet world or whatever it gets complicated.\n\n% PP: Do you have a last word?\n% JH: I was surprised by your group reaction to the visit. I thought all of this was known. Maybe I'm getting old :)\n% CARLINSAYS:Do we want to include the smiley face or was that just an impulse during the transcription? FS: let's take it out\nCurrently I don't do much about the museum department, but sometimes I like to talk about the little stories about it. I remember a lot of little stories, a lot of techniques that  have been used and forgotten, and some techniques that have been kept alive. I thought when I was young that the best techniques would succeed. That you would have visionary people who would see the way. But I realized that a lot of things happen by accident.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","attribs":"+e*7|4+x*7+a*7*3+p*g|1+1*6|1+1*h+6*5+1u*f*5+3*5+12*f*5+8*5+h*6|1+1*5+1j*f*5+7*5+29*m*5+1*7|1+1*6|1+1*h+6+9*f+1+1o*d+e*m+2*d+7+1y*f+1+18*f+1+10*d+1+3e*f+1+o*h+1+1t*h+1+1b*6|2+2+l*j+5+31*j+3+q*6|1+1|1+1*h+6*f*5+4*5+c*j*5+1*5+g*6|1+1*h+6+l*h+1+l*m+j+17*f+2+q*n+5+9*7|1+2+2*f+2+1e*d+2+3a*h|1+2*h*e+2*e+k+1*h|1+1+1j*6|2+2+1h*f+5+d*j+1+4*j+1*m+k+10*7+1*0+k+44*7+1*0+l+2y*6|2+2+e*f+1+3r*j+b+b*j+1+21*m+6+27*f+1+p*d+1+q*f+1+d*d+1+3j*6|2+2+t*f+6+14*f+2+49*d+8+15*6|2+2*h+6*5+l*j*5+8*5+d*6|1+1*h+6+t*h+1+h*d+1+m*j+4+17*d+6+1y*6|2+2*h+6*5+13*6|1+1*h+6+2p*d+1+3e*d+8*j+8+5*j+4+b*j+5+3*d+1+1*j+3+y*m+1+5*7+1*m+5+2*d+1+2*m+4*d+l+9*d+2a*7|1+1*7*e+2*e+14*7|1+1+18*d+1+b*j+3+h*j+1+g*d+u+1*6|2+2*h+6*5+1n*6|1+1*h+6+c*d+1+6*f+2+9*f+1+7*f+1+s*d+1+8*f+3+1k*d+a+9*d+1+1*d+1+r*d+u+1*d+n+e*d*e+4*e+8+1c*h+1+g*d+1+2*d+1+s*d+4+h*d|1+1+2r*d+9+1l*0+1+g*j+2+2c*d+3+24*j+2+z*6|1+1+41*6|2+2*h+6*5+15*6|1+1*h+6+i*f+1+7*f+1+3s*d+4+x*6|2+2*h+6*5+1r*f*5+1*5+z*6|1+1*h+6+8*f+1+5*j+2+l*j+3+1v*j+2*m+1+d*7|1+2*j+1i*7|1+1+2q*j+6+1j*j+6+m*d+9+f*d|1+1+f*d+1+x*j+6+13*d+1+7*d+1+9*d+1+t*d+2+w*d+6+e*d+e+2*d+2+r*d+m+g*d+9+4f*6|2+2*h+6*5+w*j*5+1*5+a*j*5+2*5+2*6|1+1*h+6+1h*j+a+u*j+1+15*j+3+9*0+1+f*0+2+4*d+a+1g*d+n+7*j+1+r*d+2*h+1*d+1+3y*d+1+15*d+3+6*j+2+19*j+1+8*d+6+9*j+1+4*j+1+a*d+4+f*d+1+1c*j+2+4*d+1+j*d+c+2*j+1+c*j+3+b*j+5+1*d+h+7*d+11+p*0+i*h+1*0+9*h+2*0+2a*h+1+1e*j+1+5*d+2+3e*d+4*7|1+2*j+1o*n+8*6|1+1+9*j+3+g*0+1*h+2*0+d*h+1*0+11+1*0+38+2q*0+4+2*0+s*j+5*0+1l*7|1+1*7*e+2*0*e+s*e+3*j*e+1*e+2*j*e+8*e+1e*j+1*7|1+1*j+32*n+8*7|1+1*h+2*0+u*j+2*0+1i*h+1*0+a*j+5*0+2d*j+1*0+n*n+1*j+1*0+9b*d|1+1*d+1+q*n+1+4*n+1+n*j+2*d+1+1y*0+1*d|1+1+d*d+t+1*j+3+4*d+5+1*d+2+1*d+l+1*d+c+k*d+p+13*d+1+n*j+7+x*d+9+1n*j+1+4*d+p+1q*h+1*d+p+c*d+6+7*0|2+2*h+6*5+17*j*5+5*5+a*j*5+2*0|1+1*h+6+1i*h+1+2f*0+4+10*h+1+25*j+1+1n*h+1+1l*j+1*7|1+1*j+57*n+8*0|2+2*h+6*j+5*5+k*j*5+1*5+2q*j*5+1*5+3*j*5+g*5+q*j*5+4*5+11*j*5+1*0|1+1*h+6+i*d+1+1*d+2+1l*j+6+g*d+7+1*0|1+1*d+2+d*j+1+11*d+7+d*d+6+z*d+1+11*d+1+1*2+e*d*2+1*2+e*d*2+1*2+b+5n*j+2+q*j+5+m*j+3+u*j+3+1*d+19*j+3*d+9+2*0|1+1+1*0|1+1*h+6*5+w*j*5+1*5+t*0|1+1*h+6+n*h+1+15*d+1+2*j+4+d*d+4*j+5*7+1+c*j+1+1*j+3+13*d+2*j+5+1*d+6+d*h+1+2u*h+1+h*7+2*j+5+f*j+3+c*j+1+4l*d|1+1+31*j+3+p*j+1+k*j+1+x*j+3+3i*d|1+1+1h*d+8+m*d+o+m*d+b+10*j+a+d*j+1+8*j+g+f*j+1+a*j+1+r*j+2*d+m*j+1*d+1f*j+1*d+w+r*0|1+1+1*0|1+1*h+6*5+4l*0|1+1*h+6+1c*d+6+q*j+5+5*d+1+6*d+2+p*j+2+7*j+2+l*d+5+4*d+5+9*d+c+1r*j+3+l*j+9+1s*j+2+1i*h+1+1a*d+6+g*j+1+1*j+1+1*d+3+4*j+8+a*d+3+g*j+4+5*d+2*0|1+1+2q*j+3+v*d+9+a*d+5+f*j+1+d*j+1+1*j+1+8*j+3+1j*j+1+16*h+1+1e*j+9+6*j+4+1d*j+1+1*j+1+t*d+b+1o*j+1+7*j+5+q*d|1+1+3n*h+1+20*j+4+1*j+1*d+c+6*j+2*d+1+1*d|1+1*d+9*j+7*d+s+3n*h+1+f*h+1+3m*0|2+2*h+6*5+v*0|1+1*h+6+4w*j+2+o*0|2+2*h+6*5+15*j*5+1*5+j*0|1+1*h+6+1f*d+3+2a*j+1+u*j+2+d*h+1+q*0|2+2*h+6*5+14*j*5+2*0|1+1*h+6+f*j+1+j*j+5+u*j+1+1*j+1+1v*j+6+14*0|1+1+3*j+4+f*j+4+f*h+1+2a*0|2+2*h+6*5+3*j*5+4*5+h*0|1+1*h+6+y*j+7+12*j+6+x*j+5+s*h+1+l*h+1+1*h+1+u*d+8*j+1+d*h|1+1*h*e+2*e+d*h|1+1+27*d+1+1e*j+1+6*d+4+u*j+4+5*j+2+g*d+4+9*d+e+g*0|2+2*h+6*5+d*h*5+1*5+3*j*5+1*5+d*0|1+1*h+6+w*h+1+1n*j+3*h+1+b*j+3+2*d+3+s*d+8+5*h+1+9*h+1+i*h+1+t*d+2+4*h+1*d+1+m*d+a*h+1*d+2+b*h+1+17*j+1+a*d+2+3b*0|2+2*h+6*5+27*0|1+1*h+6+1f*d+2+4*d+6+c*d+9*j+7*d+p+3s*h+1+2*j+1+1u*h+1+21*j+1+m*j+a+j*j+2+23*j+3+1*j+5+5*j+2+4*d+5*j+3+p*0|2+2*h+6*5+1p*0|1+1*h+6+24*j+1+8*d+1+14*h+1+41*0|2+2*h+6*5+t*0|1+1*h+6+6*j+1+w*j+1+1f*h+1+y*j+2+2x*d+3+19*j+b+o*j+1+2k*h+1+3e*j+3+y*0|2+2*h+6*5+u*0|1+1*h+6+10*d+5+c*h+1+3*d+4+r*h+1+1l*h+1+c*0|1+1+2e*h+1+w*d+11*0|2+2*h+6*5+p*h*5+1*5+1u*0|1+1*h+6+3q*h+1+16*h+1+22*h+1+2k*h+1+j*h+1+17*h+1+1y*h+1+1h*h+1+q*h+1+1g*h+1+2c*h+1+2i*h+1+b*0|2+2*h+6*5+3f*0|1+1*h+6+q*j+1+b*j+1+19*j+1+7*h+1+f*d+1+a*d+8+c*d+5+4l*d+6+3f*d+1+5*d+5+h*d+1+1*d+e+e*d|1+1+1l*h+1+a*h+1+3c*d+4*h+1+c*j+2*d+1+l*h+1+7*j+1+b*d+2+i*d+9+n*d+d*j+1*d|1+v+18*h+1+11*d+4*h+1*d+2+1s*h+1*j+1+q*h+1+n*d+1+w*d|1+1+1g*h+1+2f*d+1+a*j+1+1a*0|2+2*h+6*5+o*0|1+1*h+6+24*d+2+e*h+1+h*7|1+1*j+2w*n+m*7|1+1+3*h+1+6*h+1+1m*h+1+2s*j+4+1*j+6+s*j+1+9*j+q+s*h+1+37*h+1+t*d+2+j*0|1+1*6|3+3*0|1+1*j|1+1|1+1"}}},"pad:observatory.guide.jeanhuensitvextended:revs:11101":{"changeset":"Z:fsh>1|19=45y=8p*m+1$

We got the Unix disk distribution from Bell Labs but we could not run it, because we got another type of disk(RK07). We could look at it but that was all, because our disc format was different than the one at Bell Labs. Somebody here (P.Verbaeten) wrote a driver for that disk in l'unité d'informatique of LLN. It compiled it but we couldn't try it because we did not have a RKO7. The nearest place with Unix and a RK07 was in Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam.  Andrew Tenenbaum, who wrote a number of books on operating systems, was working there. He was learning to speak Dutch.

transcript of an interview with Jean Huens conducted by Peggy Pierrot on december 21, 2017 in an office ofDepartement Computerwetenschappen, .\n\n% PP: You have been using computers since a long time, as you explained to us during the tour we had the joy of attending during the TGSO.\nI heard that until recently, let's say the late 1990s, that to learn computer programming you had to start by writing down the program on paper?\n\n% JH: In 1973, I did study computer sciences, it was the second year of the Computer Science course, here in Leuven. At the time computers were mainframes and you did feed them with programs by punch cards. Programming was writing down the program, then you punched it and the next day you get results, mostly error. That's the way it worked at that time. To teach us programming, they used the language of that time, Fortran and some kind of invented assembly language, it didn't really exist, it was simplified.\n\nMost of the time you wrote down your program, the teacher and the assistant would have to tell you what is wrong or good, you didn't have much practical experience.\n\n% PP: What was it like, tons of pages? \n% JH: No. As an anecdocte, I remember punchcards came in huge stacks, we were jealous of the people who came into the computer center with piles of cards.\nThey were really small programs, not complicated one. In fact you had to learn to use the computer from scratch, everything was new, you couldn't rely on previous experiences. And to start with small programs was difficult enough. \n\nThat was also the time when Edsger W. Dijkstra, who fought against the \"goto\" can this be _goto_? and other common but bad constructs.[@dijksra:1972:goto] I still remember him, in an audience, giving us a lecture on good  techniques in programming at the International computing symposium 1977 in Liège.[@dijksra:1977:craft] It was a rather hard course because Dijkstra expected you to quickly  understand and implement his ideas.\n\nAnd then from '75 on, computers became cheaper and could be bought by departments and smaller entities. And than came the first interactive computer. They were still beasts, about two cubic meters, costing two millions belgian francs. But it was cheap enough to allow people to type in directly commands. I started working here in '75 as a researcher, it has evolved continuously and I saw computers getting cheaper and getting easier to use.The way to use it was simplified, you could start to go to the beast and try it out.\n\nI remember more or less: you wrote down the program in Fortran for instance. We always thought in the beginning that it would work and it didn't, so after a turn around you were giving it back to the operator and you have to wait another half a day or a night to get the results.\n\n% PP: What kind of program were you working on? \n% JH: I remember the first program I had to write was: you got three numbers and you had to make the program decide if you could construct a triangle with the numbers being the sides of the triangle.\n\n% PP: That took an afternoon to be processed?\n% JH: Well, yeah. You had to imagine how to do it which was also one problem, than you prepare the cards with the punching machine and you give the package of cards to the operator who was feeding the computer with the cards. Operators were people who had the task of feeding the computers by hand, with paper cards, and then the cards got written on disks and later processed by the mainframe from disk. Finally results got printed on paper. And after a number of hours or a night you got a listing on a piece of paper with the results or program compilation errors.\n\n% PP: When where you able to record the program onto the machine?\n% JH: I think that happened between '75 and '80. After the punching cards, which were already a way to record the program, we had typewriters and then terminals. We could record the programs by typing it on the terminal  and the computer would store them on magnetic discs. IBM had number for everything, I remember the 3300  [manufactured from 1970 on] was a magnetic disk. \nWe didn't touch the machines, operators would change the disks, we could only access the typewriter/terminal. That was our most direct connexion to the computer. The times were different. The mainframes were such huge costly beasts that it had operators day and night to keep it busy. Even at night there were two or three guys mounting tapes, disc mounting tapes, that kind of stuff.\nhttps://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/42/IBM_magnetic_disk_drives_3330%2B3333.png/600px-IBM_magnetic_disk_drives_3330%2B3333.png\n\n% PP: When did you stop working with operators?\n% JH: Somewhere between '85 and '90. There were still operators at the main computer of the university, but there were also small computers, so researchers and student could have direct access when needed. \n\n% PP: When did you start to work with software sold by others or given away in order to do your research?\n% JH: You still needed an operating system for the mainframe that was delivered by IBM or the constructor delivered the mainframe.\nWhen you bought mini-computers, which were the  smaller versions of mainframes, in most cases you bought an operating systems, compilers and all the stuff you needed to be able to program or work  those things. \nIn most cases,  the computer sciences department bought the mini-computer from, for instance *Digital Equipment Corporation*,  a manufactorer at that time, but they didn't buy DEC's  software. The DEC software  was not open source or free,  and as a university we could get Unix for free and could run it on those DEC computers. That is what the computer department of the University of Louvain la Neuve *l'unité d'informatique*, did and so did we.\n\n% PP: When did you start working with Unix as an OS? \n% JH: I took a trip to Amsterdam, it must have been in 1979 or 1980. Well, the story starts in our French sister university (LLN) where they had a PDP-11 with Unix on it. You could get Unix, at the time, when you were a university, from Bell Labs (part of AT&T), the American telephone company. AT&T was a mega organisation at the time [before the [dismantlment of AT&T/Bell system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breakup_of_the_Bell_System). Due to monopoly, the US authorities split it up into different Baby Bells. One of the restrictions was that the research Baby Bell, could not sell anything. There were computer scientists there who developed some interesting things (e.g. Unix). Universities got the source code for free, but NO support, nothing not even how to install it. In Unité d'informatique, where they had a [PDP-11/70](https://i0.wp.com/www.utterpower.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/pdp11-70-panel.jpg) they were lucky: they got the same computer that Unix was developed on.  They got the disk by snail mail as a post-office package. They mounted it and it did spin up and they had Unix. Here, we had a cheaper PDP11, [the PDP 11/60](https://dave.cheney.net/tag/pdp-11). We got the Unix disk distribution from Bell Labs but we could not run it, because we got another type of disk(RK07). We could look at it but that was all, because our disc format was different than the one at Bell Labs. Somebody here (P.Verbaeten) wrote a driver for that disk in l'unité d'informatique of LLN. It compiled it but we couldn't try it because we did not have a RKO7. The nearest place with Unix and a RK07 was in Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam.  Andrew Tenenbaum, who wrote a number of books on operating systems, was working there. He was learning to speak Dutch. We understood his English better but his assistant explained that he needed to practice speaking Dutch because he would have to pass an exam. There we compiled Unix with an RK07 driver and stored it on a bootable RK07 disk. With that d\nisk back in Leuven we could start Unix on our PDP11/60. An error in the process meant a trip Leuven-Amsterdam and back.\nIn my opinion the start of Open Source was Unix because we had to maintain it by ourselves and we learned a lot from the sources. \nIn that time for software distribution you had to store it on magnetic tape and send the tape to different places with associated problems. For example, the agents at the customs at the airport or post office didn't know what to do with the tapes or discs in terms of custom clearance. They used magnetic or x-rays as inspection tools and we had to write on the package that it should not be x-rayed. And sometimes we still got unreadable tapes/discs. \n\n% PP: So it took weeks between the transportation and the customs?\n% JH: Yes, the custom had to clear the packages. I remember I've been in the customs in Zaventem. I had received a letter that my package from Bell Labs had arrived. I went there thinking I would have to pay something and go. But no. It had to be cleared so there was some organisation that had to do administrative stuff, so I only got it a few days later. The response time was huge.\n\n% PP: After that period of time, how did you switch from that kind of collaboration on how to make software and make software work, to another kind of collaboration on networks and between universities and researchers?\n% JH: In the Unix systems at that time there was a kind of networking protocol which worked on serial lines (UUCP).\nTo connect two Unix systems together you only need a serial line. We had a line between LLN and Leuven, it's only 25 kms, but we had to ask Belgacom, then La Régie des Télégraphes et Téléphones, to get a modem to connect through their network and than over that modem you could reach an amazing speed of 300 characters per second. And that was the first communication. It happened somewhere around 1985. And then you had connection with another computer by writing something here and doing the transfer to the other computer and executing it there. \n \n% PP: What was the first thing you sent through a network like this?\n% JH: I didn't do it myself, I remember it was a kind of chat program. On the LLN side was Professor Elie Milgrom. He is retired now. On this side, it was Professor  Yves Willems. And I remember that they typed something and they got a response from the other side and that was it.  But I remember that Professor Willems sent \"Ok, we stop now.\" And that Elie Milgrom answered \"See you later, Alligator\" [a reference to Bill Haley and the Comets]. At the time we still had these kind of songs in mind. (lol). \nThose Unix to Unix connexions were first. And there was a worldwide Unix to Unix based network, Usenet (1979). It still exists somewhere.You can download loads of illegal movies and that stuff. That was not what we meant at the time. But that is what is left. And Usenet became gradually replaced by the Internet in USA. \nIn Europe, the Internet came a lot later, but we had limited access to the Internet by mail and even FTP; We could send mail to the Internet and we could receive mail from them because some friendly American university (and later companiesI translated internet mail to UCP mail. Moreover they translated specially formatted mails into FTP request and sent the result back to us by mail. That was before the 1990's.\n \n% PP: Your relation to software had changed at the time because you did not have to do all this manipulations with the software your received. Was it already floppy discs?\n% JH: No, magnetic tapes, for the mainframe at least. Even most of the mini-computers used some (cheaper) magnetic tapes. Between 1990 and 1995 the main machines used for Unix software development was a VAX from DEC. Once a year the software came from Berkeley. It was still Unix but had been modified by Berkeley for virtual memory and all the stuff which is common now. We received a tape, with lot of goodies, I still remember we didn't know what was on the tape  but we scrutinized it  to find out what was on there, what we could use...\nIn Europe, companies like Siemens were trying to set up software centers to make software avaiable. They were even trying to set up European networks. But researchers loved the Internet. It worked. It was useful for their research. So companies in Europe were trying to set up their own networks, I remember for example the X/OPEN transport protocol, which was a set of standards about what software layers should do. But it didn't succeed because around 1992 IBM decided to quit their own private network and to go for TCP/IP which was the switching point. \nEverything done for X/OPEN were suddently forgotten. For the mainframes, and certainly in Belgium computing was mainly mainframes, I'm talking about universities here, so when IBM decided to go for TCP/IP the universities followed. \nBut the adoption of TCP/IP was really slow. For example, Belgacom was not interested in running the Domain Name System so we did it here, for some time, starting in 1993 with [Pierre Verbaten](https://www.dnsbelgium.be/en/history). Belgacom were focused on X25 (DCS - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X.25) so they missed it.\n\n% PP: It was like the french Minitel?\n% JH: Well, at that time we were really jealous about Minitel. Could you imagine that? Terminals?  At home? You could work home with a computer! You could send emails! All in one, a PC computer with a modem! \n\n% PP: How did the research about software evolve in the department?\n% JH: I am mainly talking about network research but here. There were people working on numerical analysis, computing, artificial intelligence. I was just not involved in that research so I don't know much about it \n\n% PP: You were focused on software and networks?\n% JH: Yes, we produced some software. We made software to generate compilers. There was some A.I. software in Prolog, numerical analysis libraries, etc. Some were sold or shared, it depends.  \nWe sold some software from the beginning I think when it was not even a department but a professor and a couple of students.\n\n% PP: Is that when you joined?\n% JH: No it was already a department. I studied industrial engeneering in electronics first. At the time in electronics you heard something about computers, I was interested in it. I wanted to know more. I heard Kuleuven had started a degree in computer engineering. It was the first year where industrial engineers could join. The only thing we knew about computers were from movies. I wanted to know how they worked. I'm not sure if I know now it now, but I have some ideas.\n\n% PP: How many languages do you know?\n% JH: Assembly, FORTRAN, PL-1 the language invented by IBM to be the universal one, C, Cobol. Perl...I don't know...some more. I'm not fluent in any computer language, but I can read any language especially well written, I know I can understand it and, if needed, learn it... I know JAVA also. As a system administrator, the thing I use most are the command line of UNIX and Perl. But that's because i'm more familiar with those two so it goes faster.\n\n% PP: How did you see the rise of personnal computer and the software that goes with?\n% JH: I have to admit that we missed it. We didn't see the new thing was powerful because it was available for everybody.  We were not impressed by the software. I remember windows 95, the news on TV, people sleeping on the street to get it. I remember when I got my first windows version, with a box of 22 floppies or so. Then I wanted to do something, to compile a program, but there was no compiler. We were used to Unix, which was a basic system but haa lot of utilities in it. Software was for us free, and we were used to having it be free, and on a PC it was not free anymore. \n\n% PP: Does that mean you didn't had a personal computer until late?\n% JH: Yes. I think it was round 2000. I didn't need it really. I got one when the Belgian UUCP network became commercial. Of course I did not get Windows on it. I think we got Linux here in 1994. There was a guy involved in the kernel studying here. So we did used it very fast.\n\n% PP: So, what is software for you?\n% JH: For me, software is the magic that makes computer usable. I can only give examples of what I mean by it. A PC without software- most people, even computer scientists, can't do anything with it. You need basic software. Some software is already integrated in the computer hardware. It is the same for phones, tablets. The main characteristic, for me, is that it should be user friendly. That is very difficult I know, because you have to imagine what the people using your software are going to do with it and how they want to use it. That's the magic you need to solve.\n\n% PP: Is command line user friendly?\n% JH: Well, somehow you have to learn the Unix command language; it is in fact a computer language where you can make all the constructs that other languages offers.\nYou can create loops, you can test, whatever. It's not so different from computer languages like C or JAVA or whatever. It is certainly programmer friendly.\n\n% PP: But it's already software, no? User friendly depends on what you put behind these words, no?\n% JH: Yes it's already software. I don't have a strong opinion about command lines. It depends on people. I can imagine that someone that has never heard about the command line expects that you click somewhere and it happens. But if you know the command language it's sometimes perhaps easier or productive to type commands and let it run. Sometimes, I find it easier if I have a screen and a number of buttons and I don't have to imagine what happens behind that screen. And sometimes I want to do something with the command line, because I'm used to it. That's why I don't trust myself about user friendliness because I have a long experience in computer interfaces. I'm so used to some of them perhaps I can't even imagine that somebody else would like to do it otherwise or doesn't like what I'm used to.\n\n% PP: Apart from maintaining the museum, what do you work on? You are still active in the department even though you are retired?\n% JH: I work on sensors, in the Internet of Things world in one of the university spin-offs. What I do for them is: wireless sensors need power, most of them are on batteries. They have designed a complete system which should make the battery last for two, three, four years. They need a system to measure that. So I have been working on a mechanism to measure that without waiting four years. That's programming instrumentation computers to measure e.g. power or whatever. Most of it on Unix systems. \nThere are enough new or unknown things and maybe because I'm older, I have another way of looking at things, so we have a lot of discussions. They don't like my Perl, they use python, JAVA and those things... Perl, it has its disadvantages, but you can do a lot of things. Every character has a meaning, that makes Perl programs often unreadable.\nWith Python, you need all those libraries... It's easy when you know the libraries, what you have to call. When you know the arguments of the librairies. So it's also complicated. And if the library changes for some reasons, there you go.\nIn my humble opinion it's the same with all the languages. It starts easy from scratch but if you have to interface them with existing things from the Internet world or whatever it gets complicated.\n\n% PP: Do you have a last word?\n% JH: I was surprised by your group reaction to the visit. I thought all of this was known. Maybe I'm getting old.\nCurrently I don't do much about the museum department, but sometimes I like to talk about the little stories about it. I remember a lot of little stories, a lot of techniques that  have been used and forgotten, and some techniques that have been kept alive. I thought when I was young that the best techniques would succeed. That you would have visionary people who would see the way.

We could look at it but that was all, because our disc format was different than the one at Bell Labs. Somebody here (P. Verbaeten) wrote a driver for that disk in l'unité d'informatique of LLN.

Andrew Tenenbaum, who wrote a number of books on operating systems, was working there. He was learning to speak Dutch.

__NOPUBLISH__\n\n\n**You have been using computers since a long time, as you explained us during the tour we had the joy of assisting during the TGSO.**\n**I heard that that until recently, let's say the late 1990's, when learning computer programming you had to start by  writing down the program on paper... ** \n\nIn 1973, i did study computer sciences, it was the second year of the department, here in Leuven. At the time computers were mainframes and you did fed them with programms by punch cards. Programing was writing down the program, than you punched it and the next day you get results, mostly error. That's the way it worked at that time. To teach us programing, they used the langage of that time, Fortran and some kind of invented assembly langage, it didn't really exist, it was simplified.\n\nMost of the time you did write down your program, the teacher and the assistant would have to tell you what is wrong or good, you didn't had much practical experience.\n\n**How was it like, tons of pages ?** \n\nNo. As an anecdocte, i remember punchcards were a block of papers, we were jealous of the people who came in the computer center with huge stacks of cards. That were really small programs, not complicated one. The fact you had to learn to use the computer from scratch, everything was new, you couldn't rely on previous experiences, everything was new. And to start with small programs was difficult enough. \n\nThat was also the time when Edsger W. Dijkstra who forked the goto... i still remember him, in an audience, giving us a lecture on modernisation in programming at the International computing symposium 1977 in Liège (programming: from craft to scientific discipline https://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/EWD/transcriptions/EWD05xx/EWD566.html). He told usxx (i'll complete it as soon as possible. i need Jean's input)\"\n\nAnd then from 75 on, computers became cheaper and could be bought by departments and smaller entities. And than came the first interactive computer. Still beasts about two cubic meters, costing two millions belgian francs. But it was low enough to allow people to type in directly commands. I started working here in 75 as a researcher, it have evolved continuously and i saw computer getting cheaper and getting easier to use.The way to use it was simplified, you could start to go to the beast and try it out.\n\nI remember more or less: you did write down the program in Fortran for instance… We always thought in the beginning that it would work and it didn't, so after a turn around you were giving it back to the operator and you have to wait half a day or a night to get the results.\n\n**What kind of program you were working on?** \n\nI remember the first program i had to write was you got three numbers, you had to make the program decide if you construct a triangle with the numbers being the sides of the triangle.\n\n**That took an afternoon to be processed ?** \n\nWell, yeah. You had to imagine how to do it which was also one problem, than you prepare the card with the punching machine and you give the package of cards to the operator who was feeeding the computer with the cards. People had the taks to fed the computers by hands, with paper, cards, than disks and it lasts onto the magnetic disks period. And after a number of hours or a night you get a listing, a piece of paper, with the results.\n\n**When where you able to record the program onto the machine?**\n\nI think that happens between 75 and 80. After the punching cards which was already a way to record the program, we had  typewriters, terminals but we could record the programs, we could store them on the computer. We had magnetic discs. IBM had number for everything, i remember the 33-30 [manufactured from 1970 on] had a magnetic disk. We didn't touch the machines, operators would change the disks, we could only access the typewriter. That was our most direct connexion to the computer. Thetimes were diffent. The mainframes were such huge costly beasts that it had operators day and night keeping it busy. Even at night there were two or three guys mounting tapes, dismounting tapes, that kind of stuff.\nhttps://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/42/IBM_magnetic_disk_drives_3330%2B3333.png/600px-IBM_magnetic_disk_drives_3330%2B3333.png\n\n**When did you stop working with operators?** \n\nSomewhere between 85 and 90. There were still operators at the main computer of the university, but there were also small computers, so researchers and student can have direct access when needed. \n\n**When did you start to work with software sold by others or gived away in order to do your research?** \n\nYou stil need an operating system on the mainframe that was delivered by IBM or the constructor delivering the mainframe. When you bought mini-computers, which were the  smaller versions of mainframes, in most cases you did buy an operating systems, compilers and all the stuff you need to be able to program those things. In most cases, because the computer sciences department did buy the mini-computer from, for instance *digital equipment corporation*,  a manufactorer of that time, but they didn't buy their software. They were not open source or free,  but you could get Unix and could run it on those digital equipment (DEC) computers. That is what the computer department of the University of Louvain la Neuve *l'unité d'informatique*, did and so did we.\n\n**When did you start working with unix as an os?** \n\nI took a trip to Amsterdam, it must have been in 1979/80… Well, the story starts in our french sister university (LLN) where they did have a PDP-11 with Unix on it https://hackadaycom.files.wordpress.com/2016/08/full-size-pdp11.jpg. You got Unix, at the time, when you were a university, from Bell Aps (Ma Bell), the american telephone company. It was a mega organisation at the time [before the [dismantlment of AT&T/Bell system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breakup_of_the_Bell_System)].Due to monopoly, the US authorities splitted up in different Baby Bells. One of the restriction was there was a research baby bell, they couldn't really sell anything.There were computer scientists there, who did developped some Unix interesting things.  For universities you did get the source and no support for free. How to install it, no idea. In Unité d'informatique, they were lucky: they got the same computer that unix were developped on.  They got the disk by snail mail as a post-office package. They mounted it and it did spin up and they had it.\nHere, we did have a cheaper PDP11 (DEC - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PDP-11) We go the disk source from Bell Aps but we could not run it. We could look at it but that was all, because our disc format was different than the one at Bell Aps. Somebody here did write a driver for that disk and we did compiled it in l'unité d'informatique of LLN.  it did compile it but we couldn't try it because we did not have So we find the nearest Unix system compatiblewith ours, it was in Amsterdam.  Andrew Tenebaum who did write since then a number of books about operating systems and became quite an authority. He was working there. It was the young Tanenbaum, just arriving from United States to Amsterdam. He was learning to speak dutch. We did understood his english better but his assistant insisted that he speaks dutch because he will have to pass an exam in dutch. There we got a disk, than also the one with the driver we compiled, than we got here and we start using Unix.  Than in my opinion the start of open source was Unix because we had to maintain it by ourselves and we learned a lot from the sources.\nIn that time we did had to get software and it brings us to different places. For example, at the time the agents at the custom at the airport or post didn't know what to do with the discs in terms of custom clearance. They used

__NOPUBLISH__\n\n\n**You have been using computers since a long time, as you explained us during the tour we had the joy of assisting during the TGSO.**\n**I heard that that until recently, let's say the late 1990's, when learning computer programming you had to start by  writing down the program on paper... ** \n\nIn 1973, i did study computer sciences, it was the second year of the department, here in Leuven. At the time computers were mainframes and you did fed them with programms by punch cards. Programing was writing down the program, than you punched it and the next day you get results, mostly error. That's the way it worked at that time. To teach us programing, they used the langage of that time, Fortran and some kind of invented assembly langage, it didn't really exist, it was simplified.\n\nMost of the time you did write down your program, the teacher and the assistant would have to tell you what is wrong or good, you didn't had much practical experience.\n\n**How was it like, tons of pages ?** \n\nNo. As an anecdocte, i remember punchcards were a block of papers, we were jealous of the people who came in the computer center with huge stacks of cards. That were really small programs, not complicated one. The fact you had to learn to use the computer from scratch, everything was new, you couldn't rely on previous experiences, everything was new. And to start with small programs was difficult enough. \n\nThat was also the time when Edsger W. Dijkstra who forked the goto... i still remember him, in an audience, giving us a lecture on modernisation in programming at the International computing symposium 1977 in Liège (programming: from craft to scientific discipline https://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/EWD/transcriptions/EWD05xx/EWD566.html). He told usxx (i'll complete it as soon as possible. i need Jean's input)\"\n\nAnd then from 75 on, computers became cheaper and could be bought by departments and smaller entities. And than came the first interactive computer. Still beasts about two cubic meters, costing two millions belgian francs. But it was low enough to allow people to type in directly commands. I started working here in 75 as a researcher, it have evolved continuously and i saw computer getting cheaper and getting easier to use.The way to use it was simplified, you could start to go to the beast and try it out.\n\nI remember more or less: you did write down the program in Fortran for instance… We always thought in the beginning that it would work and it didn't, so after a turn around you were giving it back to the operator and you have to wait half a day or a night to get the results.\n\n**What kind of program you were working on?** \n\nI remember the first program i had to write was you got three numbers, you had to make the program decide if you construct a triangle with the numbers being the sides of the triangle.\n\n**That took an afternoon to be processed ?** \n\nWell, yeah. You had to imagine how to do it which was also one problem, than you prepare the card with the punching machine and you give the package of cards to the operator who was feeeding the computer with the cards. People had the taks to fed the computers by hands, with paper, cards, than disks and it lasts onto the magnetic disks period. And after a number of hours or a night you get a listing, a piece of paper, with the results.\n\n**When where you able to record the program onto the machine?**\n\nI think that happens between 75 and 80. After the punching cards which was already a way to record the program, we had  typewriters, terminals but we could record the programs, we could store them on the computer. We had magnetic discs. IBM had number for everything, i remember the 33-30 [manufactured from 1970 on] had a magnetic disk. We didn't touch the machines, operators would change the disks, we could only access the typewriter. That was our most direct connexion to the computer. Thetimes were diffent. The mainframes were such huge costly beasts that it had operators day and night keeping it busy. Even at night there were two or three guys mounting tapes, dismounting tapes, that kind of stuff.\nhttps://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/42/IBM_magnetic_disk_drives_3330%2B3333.png/600px-IBM_magnetic_disk_drives_3330%2B3333.png\n\n**When did you stop working with operators?** \n\nSomewhere between 85 and 90. There were still operators at the main computer of the university, but there were also small computers, so researchers and student can have direct access when needed. \n\n**When did you start to work with software sold by others or gived away in order to do your research?** \n\nYou stil need an operating system on the mainframe that was delivered by IBM or the constructor delivering the mainframe. When you bought mini-computers, which were the  smaller versions of mainframes, in most cases you did buy an operating systems, compilers and all the stuff you need to be able to program those things. In most cases, because the computer sciences department did buy the mini-computer from, for instance *digital equipment corporation*,  a manufactorer of that time, but they didn't buy their software. They were not open source or free,  but you could get Unix and could run it on those digital equipment (DEC) computers. That is what the computer department of the University of Louvain la Neuve *l'unité d'informatique*, did and so did we.\n\n**When did you start working with unix as an os?** \n\nI took a trip to Amsterdam, it must have been in 1979/80… Well, the story starts in our french sister university (LLN) where they did have a PDP-11 with Unix on it https://hackadaycom.files.wordpress.com/2016/08/full-size-pdp11.jpg. You got Unix, at the time, when you were a university, from Bell Aps (Ma Bell), the american telephone company. It was a mega organisation at the time [before the [dismantlment of AT&T/Bell system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breakup_of_the_Bell_System)].Due to monopoly, the US authorities splitted up in different Baby Bells. One of the restriction was there was a research baby bell, they couldn't really sell anything.There were computer scientists there, who did developped some Unix interesting things.  For universities you did get the source and no support for free. How to install it, no idea. In Unité d'informatique, they were lucky: they got the same computer that unix were developped on.  They got the disk by snail mail as a post-office package. They mounted it and it did spin up and they had it.\nHere, we did have a cheaper PDP11 (DEC - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PDP-11) We go the disk source from Bell Aps but we could not run it. We could look at it but that was all, because our disc format was different than the one at Bell Aps. Somebody here did write a driver for that disk and we did compiled it in l'unité d'informatique of LLN.  it did compile it but we couldn't try it because we did not have So we find the nearest Unix system compatiblewith ours, it was in Amsterdam.  Andrew Tenebaum who did write since then a number of books about operating systems and became quite an authority. He was working there. It was the young Tanenbaum, just arriving from United States to Amsterdam. He was learning to speak dutch. We did understood his english better but his assistant insisted that he speaks dutch because he will have to pass an exam in dutch. There we got a disk, than also the one with the driver we compiled, than we got here and we start using Unix.  Than in my opinion the start of open source was Unix because we had to maintain it by ourselves and we learned a lot from the sources.\nIn that time we did had to get software and it brings us to different places. For example, at the time the agents at the custom at the airport or post didn't know what to do with the discs in terms of custom clearance. They used magnetic or xrays, we had to write on the package that it should not be x-rayed. But we got time to time unreadable discs. \n\nSo it took like weeks between the transportation, the custom..\n\n\n\n\n\n","attribs":"|1+g*6|2+2*5+3p*6|1+1*5+4f*6|2+2+dm*6|2+2+4n*6|1+1|1+1*5+11*6|2+2+bc*6|2+2+5z*2+3e*3+1*4*3+20*4+1*6|2+2+e7*6|2+2+7n*6|2+2*5+1a*6|2+2+53*6|2+2*5+19*6|2+2+c7*6|2+2*5+1r*6|2+2+jo*6|1+1+41*6|2+2*5+1a*6|2+2+5g*6|2+2*5+2w*6|2+2+l6*6|2+2*5+1f*6|2+2+8f*5+7+kh*6|1+1+uu*0|3+9v*0+1q*6|5+5|1+1"}}},"pad:observatory.guide.jeanhuensitvextended:revs:1301":{"changeset":"Z:66q>1|1b=64u=1q*0+1$.","meta":{"author":"a.kqv62Q3nhchdwIuK","timestamp":1518091154908}},"pad:observatory.guide.jeanhuensitvextended:revs:1302":{"changeset":"Z:66r>1|1b=64u=1r*0|1+1$\n","meta":{"author":"a.kqv62Q3nhchdwIuK","timestamp":1518091155408}},"pad:observatory.guide.jeanhuensitvextended:revs:1303":{"changeset":"Z:66s>1|1c=66m*0+1$Y","meta":{"author":"a.kqv62Q3nhchdwIuK","timestamp":1518091155907}},"pad:observatory.guide.jeanhuensitvextended:revs:1304":{"changeset":"Z:66t>3|1c=66m=1*0+3$eah","meta":{"author":"a.kqv62Q3nhchdwIuK","timestamp":1518091156408}},"pad:observatory.guide.jeanhuensitvextended:revs:1305":{"changeset":"Z:66w<2|1c=66m=2-2$","meta":{"author":"a.kqv62Q3nhchdwIuK","timestamp":1518091156908}},"pad:observatory.guide.jeanhuensitvextended:revs:1306":{"changeset":"Z:66u>0|1c=66m=1-1*0+1$s","meta":{"author":"a.kqv62Q3nhchdwIuK","timestamp":1518091157410}},"pad:observatory.guide.jeanhuensitvextended:revs:1307":{"changeset":"Z:66u>2|1c=66m=1-1*0+3$es,","meta":{"author":"a.kqv62Q3nhchdwIuK","timestamp":1518091157924}},"pad:observatory.guide.jeanhuensitvextended:revs:1308":{"changeset":"Z:66w>2|1c=66m=4*0+2$ t","meta":{"author":"a.kqv62Q3nhchdwIuK","timestamp":1518091158426}},"pad:observatory.guide.jeanhuensitvextended:revs:1309":{"changeset":"Z:66y>3|1c=66m=6*0+3$he ","meta":{"author":"a.kqv62Q3nhchdwIuK","timestamp":1518091158931}},"pad:observatory.guide.jeanhuensitvextended:revs:131":{"changeset":"Z:34x>1|v=2rg=35*0+1$ ","meta":{"author":"a.kqv62Q3nhchdwIuK","timestamp":1518015318819}},"pad:observatory.guide.jeanhuensitvextended:revs:1310":{"changeset":"Z:671>3|1c=66m=9*0+3$cus","meta":{"author":"a.kqv62Q3nhchdwIuK","timestamp":1518091159434}},"pad:observatory.guide.jeanhuensitvextended:revs:1311":{"changeset":"Z:674>2|1c=66m=c*0+2$to","meta":{"author":"a.kqv62Q3nhchdwIuK","timestamp":1518091159947}},"pad:observatory.guide.jeanhuensitvextended:revs:1312":{"changeset":"Z:676>1|1c=66m=e*0+1$m","meta":{"author":"a.kqv62Q3nhchdwIuK","timestamp":1518091160447}},"pad:observatory.guide.jeanhuensitvextended:revs:1313":{"changeset":"Z:677>1|1c=66m=f*0+1$ ","meta":{"author":"a.kqv62Q3nhchdwIuK","timestamp":1518091161112}},"pad:observatory.guide.jeanhuensitvextended:revs:1314":{"changeset":"Z:678>4|1c=66m=g*0+4$had ","meta":{"author":"a.kqv62Q3nhchdwIuK","timestamp":1518091161613}},"pad:observatory.guide.jeanhuensitvextended:revs:1315":{"changeset":"Z:67c>2|1c=66m=k*0+2$to","meta":{"author":"a.kqv62Q3nhchdwIuK","timestamp":1518091162115}},"pad:observatory.guide.jeanhuensitvextended:revs:1316":{"changeset":"Z:67e>3|1c=66m=m*0+3$ cl","meta":{"author":"a.kqv62Q3nhchdwIuK","timestamp":1518091162615}},"pad:observatory.guide.jeanhuensitvextended:revs:1317":{"changeset":"Z:67h>5|1c=66m=p*0+5$ear t","meta":{"author":"a.kqv62Q3nhchdwIuK","timestamp":1518091163122}},"pad:observatory.guide.jeanhuensitvextended:revs:1318":{"changeset":"Z:67m>3|1c=66m=u*0+3$he ","meta":{"author":"a.kqv62Q3nhchdwIuK","timestamp":1518091163622}},"pad:observatory.guide.jeanhuensitvextended:revs:1319":{"changeset":"Z:67p>3|1c=66m=x*0+3$pac","meta":{"author":"a.kqv62Q3nhchdwIuK","timestamp":1518091164122}},"pad:observatory.guide.jeanhuensitvextended:revs:132":{"changeset":"Z:34y>2|v=2rg=36*0+2$ha","meta":{"author":"a.kqv62Q3nhchdwIuK","timestamp":1518015319289}},"pad:observatory.guide.jeanhuensitvextended:revs:1320":{"changeset":"Z:67s>3|1c=66m=10*0+3$kag","meta":{"author":"a.kqv62Q3nhchdwIuK","timestamp":1518091164623}},"pad:observatory.guide.jeanhuensitvextended:revs:1321":{"changeset":"Z:67v>2|1c=66m=13*0+2$es","meta":{"author":"a.kqv62Q3nhchdwIuK","timestamp":1518091165127}},"pad:observatory.guide.jeanhuensitvextended:revs:1322":{"changeset":"Z:67x>2|1c=66m=15*0+2$.

__NOPUBLISH__\n\n\n**You have been using computers since a long time, as you explained us during the tour we had the joy of assisting during the TGSO.**\n**I heard that that until recently, let's say the late 1990's, when learning computer programming you had to start by  writing down the program on paper... ** \n\nIn 1973, i did study computer sciences, it was the second year of the department, here in Leuven. At the time computers were mainframes and you did fed them with programms by punch cards. Programing was writing down the program, than you punched it and the next day you get results, mostly error. That's the way it worked at that time. To teach us programing, they used the langage of that time, Fortran and some kind of invented assembly langage, it didn't really exist, it was simplified.\n\nMost of the time you did write down your program, the teacher and the assistant would have to tell you what is wrong or good, you didn't had much practical experience.\n\n**How was it like, tons of pages ?** \n\nNo. As an anecdocte, i remember punchcards were a block of papers, we were jealous of the people who came in the computer center with huge stacks of cards. That were really small programs, not complicated one. The fact you had to learn to use the computer from scratch, everything was new, you couldn't rely on previous experiences, everything was new. And to start with small programs was difficult enough. \n\nThat was also the time when Edsger W. Dijkstra who forked the goto... i still remember him, in an audience, giving us a lecture on modernisation in programming at the International computing symposium 1977 in Liège (programming: from craft to scientific discipline https://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/EWD/transcriptions/EWD05xx/EWD566.html). He told usxx (i'll complete it as soon as possible. i need Jean's input)\"\n\nAnd then from 75 on, computers became cheaper and could be bought by departments and smaller entities. And than came the first interactive computer. Still beasts about two cubic meters, costing two millions belgian francs. But it was low enough to allow people to type in directly commands. I started working here in 75 as a researcher, it have evolved continuously and i saw computer getting cheaper and getting easier to use.The way to use it was simplified, you could start to go to the beast and try it out.\n\nI remember more or less: you did write down the program in Fortran for instance… We always thought in the beginning that it would work and it didn't, so after a turn around you were giving it back to the operator and you have to wait half a day or a night to get the results.\n\n**What kind of program you were working on?** \n\nI remember the first program i had to write was you got three numbers, you had to make the program decide if you construct a triangle with the numbers being the sides of the triangle.\n\n**That took an afternoon to be processed ?** \n\nWell, yeah. You had to imagine how to do it which was also one problem, than you prepare the card with the punching machine and you give the package of cards to the operator who was feeeding the computer with the cards. People had the taks to fed the computers by hands, with paper, cards, than disks and it lasts onto the magnetic disks period. And after a number of hours or a night you get a listing, a piece of paper, with the results.\n\n**When where you able to record the program onto the machine?**\n\nI think that happens between 75 and 80. After the punching cards which was already a way to record the program, we had  typewriters, terminals but we could record the programs, we could store them on the computer. We had magnetic discs. IBM had number for everything, i remember the 33-30 [manufactured from 1970 on] had a magnetic disk. We didn't touch the machines, operators would change the disks, we could only access the typewriter. That was our most direct connexion to the computer. Thetimes were diffent. The mainframes were such huge costly beasts that it had operators day and night keeping it busy. Even at night there were two or three guys mounting tapes, dismounting tapes, that kind of stuff.\nhttps://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/42/IBM_magnetic_disk_drives_3330%2B3333.png/600px-IBM_magnetic_disk_drives_3330%2B3333.png\n\n**When did you stop working with operators?** \n\nSomewhere between 85 and 90. There were still operators at the main computer of the university, but there were also small computers, so researchers and student can have direct access when needed. \n\n**When did you start to work with software sold by others or gived away in order to do your research?** \n\nYou stil need an operating system on the mainframe that was delivered by IBM or the constructor delivering the mainframe. When you bought mini-computers, which were the  smaller versions of mainframes, in most cases you did buy an operating systems, compilers and all the stuff you need to be able to program those things. In most cases, because the computer sciences department did buy the mini-computer from, for instance *digital equipment corporation*,  a manufactorer of that time, but they didn't buy their software. They were not open source or free,  but you could get Unix and could run it on those digital equipment (DEC) computers. That is what the computer department of the University of Louvain la Neuve *l'unité d'informatique*, did and so did we.\n\n**When did you start working with unix as an os?** \n\nI took a trip to Amsterdam, it must have been in 1979/80… Well, the story starts in our french sister university (LLN) where they did have a PDP-11 with Unix on it https://hackadaycom.files.wordpress.com/2016/08/full-size-pdp11.jpg. You got Unix, at the time, when you were a university, from Bell Aps (Ma Bell), the american telephone company. It was a mega organisation at the time [before the [dismantlment of AT&T/Bell system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breakup_of_the_Bell_System)].Due to monopoly, the US authorities splitted up in different Baby Bells. One of the restriction was there was a research baby bell, they couldn't really sell anything.There were computer scientists there, who did developped some Unix interesting things.  For universities you did get the source and no support for free. How to install it, no idea. In Unité d'informatique, they were lucky: they got the same computer that unix were developped on.  They got the disk by snail mail as a post-office package. They mounted it and it did spin up and they had it.\nHere, we did have a cheaper PDP11 (DEC - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PDP-11) We go the disk source from Bell Aps but we could not run it. We could look at it but that was all, because our disc format was different than the one at Bell Aps. Somebody here did write a driver for that disk and we did compiled it in l'unité d'informatique of LLN.  it did compile it but we couldn't try it because we did not have So we find the nearest Unix system compatiblewith ours, it was in Amsterdam.  Andrew Tenebaum who did write since then a number of books about operating systems and became quite an authority. He was working there. It was the young Tanenbaum, just arriving from United States to Amsterdam. He was learning to speak dutch. We did understood his english better but his assistant insisted that he speaks dutch because he will have to pass an exam in dutch. There we got a disk, than also the one with the driver we compiled, than we got here and we start using Unix.  Than in my opinion the start of open source was Unix because we had to maintain it by ourselves and we learned a lot from the sources.\nIn that time we did had to get software and it brings us to different places. For example, at the time the agents at the custom at the airport or post didn't know what to do with the discs in terms of custom clearance. They used magnetic or xrays, we had to write on the package that it should not be x-rayed. But we got time to time unreadable discs. \n\nSo it took like weeks between the transportation, the custom...\nYes, the custom had to clear the packages. I remember i've been in the customs in Zaventem. I had received a letter that my package from Bell Aps had arrived. I went there thinki\n\n\n\n\n\n","attribs":"|1+g*6|2+2*5+3p*6|1+1*5+4f*6|2+2+dm*6|2+2+4n*6|1+1|1+1*5+11*6|2+2+bc*6|2+2+5z*2+3e*3+1*4*3+20*4+1*6|2+2+e7*6|2+2+7n*6|2+2*5+1a*6|2+2+53*6|2+2*5+19*6|2+2+c7*6|2+2*5+1r*6|2+2+jo*6|1+1+41*6|2+2*5+1a*6|2+2+5g*6|2+2*5+2w*6|2+2+l6*6|2+2*5+1f*6|2+2+8f*5+7+kh*6|1+1+uu*0|4+bn*0+4y*6|5+5|1+1"}}},"pad:observatory.guide.jeanhuensitvextended:revs:1401":{"changeset":"Z:6bq>3|1c=66m=4y*0+3$ng ","meta":{"author":"a.kqv62Q3nhchdwIuK","timestamp":1518091225619}},"pad:observatory.guide.jeanhuensitvextended:revs:1402":{"changeset":"Z:6bt>2|1c=66m=51*0+2$i ","meta":{"author":"a.kqv62Q3nhchdwIuK","timestamp":1518091226120}},"pad:observatory.guide.jeanhuensitvextended:revs:1403":{"changeset":"Z:6bv>2|1c=66m=53*0+2$wo","meta":{"author":"a.kqv62Q3nhchdwIuK","timestamp":1518091226620}},"pad:observatory.guide.jeanhuensitvextended:revs:1404":{"changeset":"Z:6bx>1|1c=66m=55*0+1$u","meta":{"author":"a.kqv62Q3nhchdwIuK","timestamp":1518091227274}},"pad:observatory.guide.jeanhuensitvextended:revs:1405":{"changeset":"Z:6by>2|1c=66m=56*0+2$ld","meta":{"author":"a.kqv62Q3nhchdwIuK","timestamp":1518091227775}},"pad:observatory.guide.jeanhuensitvextended:revs:1406":{"changeset":"Z:6c0>6|1c=66m=58*0+6$ have ","meta":{"author":"a.kqv62Q3nhchdwIuK","timestamp":1518091228275}},"pad:observatory.guide.jeanhuensitvextended:revs:1407":{"changeset":"Z:6c6>3|1c=66m=5e*0+3$to ","meta":{"author":"a.kqv62Q3nhchdwIuK","timestamp":1518091228779}},"pad:observatory.guide.jeanhuensitvextended:revs:1408":{"changeset":"Z:6c9>4|1c=66m=5h*0+4$pay ","meta":{"author":"a.kqv62Q3nhchdwIuK","timestamp":1518091229293}},"pad:observatory.guide.jeanhuensitvextended:revs:1409":{"changeset":"Z:6cd>2|1c=66m=5l*0+2$so","meta":{"author":"a.kqv62Q3nhchdwIuK","timestamp":1518091229813}},"pad:observatory.guide.jeanhuensitvextended:revs:141":{"changeset":"Z:3fq>nf|12=3fm*0|4+nf$**When did you start to work with software sold by others or gived away in order to do your research?** \n\nYou did need an operating system on the mainframe that was delivered by IBM or \nthe constructor delivering the mainframe.

__NOPUBLISH__\n\n\n**You have been using computers since a long time, as you explained us during the tour we had the joy of assisting during the TGSO.**\n**I heard that that until recently, let's say the late 1990's, when learning computer programming you had to start by  writing down the program on paper... ** \n\nIn 1973, i did study computer sciences, it was the second year of the department, here in Leuven. At the time computers were mainframes and you did fed them with programms by punch cards. Programing was writing down the program, than you punched it and the next day you get results, mostly error. That's the way it worked at that time. To teach us programing, they used the langage of that time, Fortran and some kind of invented assembly langage, it didn't really exist, it was simplified.\n\nMost of the time you did write down your program, the teacher and the assistant would have to tell you what is wrong or good, you didn't had much practical experience.\n\n**How was it like, tons of pages ?** \n\nNo. As an anecdocte, i remember punchcards were a block of papers, we were jealous of the people who came in the computer center with huge stacks of cards. That were really small programs, not complicated one. The fact you had to learn to use the computer from scratch, everything was new, you couldn't rely on previous experiences, everything was new. And to start with small programs was difficult enough. \n\nThat was also the time when Edsger W. Dijkstra who forked the goto... i still remember him, in an audience, giving us a lecture on modernisation in programming at the International computing symposium 1977 in Liège (programming: from craft to scientific discipline https://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/EWD/transcriptions/EWD05xx/EWD566.html). He told usxx (i'll complete it as soon as possible. i need Jean's input)\"\n\nAnd then from 75 on, computers became cheaper and could be bought by departments and smaller entities. And than came the first interactive computer. Still beasts about two cubic meters, costing two millions belgian francs. But it was low enough to allow people to type in directly commands. I started working here in 75 as a researcher, it have evolved continuously and i saw computer getting cheaper and getting easier to use.The way to use it was simplified, you could start to go to the beast and try it out.\n\nI remember more or less: you did write down the program in Fortran for instance… We always thought in the beginning that it would work and it didn't, so after a turn around you were giving it back to the operator and you have to wait half a day or a night to get the results.\n\n**What kind of program you were working on?** \n\nI remember the first program i had to write was you got three numbers, you had to make the program decide if you construct a triangle with the numbers being the sides of the triangle.\n\n**That took an afternoon to be processed ?** \n\nWell, yeah. You had to imagine how to do it which was also one problem, than you prepare the card with the punching machine and you give the package of cards to the operator who was feeeding the computer with the cards. People had the taks to fed the computers by hands, with paper, cards, than disks and it lasts onto the magnetic disks period. And after a number of hours or a night you get a listing, a piece of paper, with the results.\n\n**When where you able to record the program onto the machine?**\n\nI think that happens between 75 and 80. After the punching cards which was already a way to record the program, we had  typewriters, terminals but we could record the programs, we could store them on the computer. We had magnetic discs. IBM had number for everything, i remember the 33-30 [manufactured from 1970 on] had a magnetic disk. We didn't touch the machines, operators would change the disks, we could only access the typewriter. That was our most direct connexion to the computer. Thetimes were diffent. The mainframes were such huge costly beasts that it had operators day and night keeping it busy. Even at night there were two or three guys mounting tapes, dismounting tapes, that kind of stuff.\nhttps://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/42/IBM_magnetic_disk_drives_3330%2B3333.png/600px-IBM_magnetic_disk_drives_3330%2B3333.png\n\n**When did you stop working with operators?** \n\nSomewhere between 85 and 90. There were still operators at the main computer of the university, but there were also small computers, so researchers and student can have direct access when needed. \n\n**When did you start to work with software sold by others or gived away in order to do your research?** \n\nYou stil need an operating system on the mainframe that was delivered by IBM or the constructor delivering the mainframe. When you bought mini-computers, which were the  smaller versions of mainframes, in most cases you did buy an operating systems, compilers and all the stuff you need to be able to program those things. In most cases, because the computer sciences department did buy the mini-computer from, for instance *digital equipment corporation*,  a manufactorer of that time, but they didn't buy their software. They were not open source or free,  but you could get Unix and could run it on those digital equipment (DEC) computers. That is what the computer department of the University of Louvain la Neuve *l'unité d'informatique*, did and so did we.\n\n**When did you start working with unix as an os?** \n\nI took a trip to Amsterdam, it must have been in 1979/80… Well, the story starts in our french sister university (LLN) where they did have a PDP-11 with Unix on it https://hackadaycom.files.wordpress.com/2016/08/full-size-pdp11.jpg. You got Unix, at the time, when you were a university, from Bell Aps (Ma Bell), the american telephone company. It was a mega organisation at the time [before the [dismantlment of AT&T/Bell system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breakup_of_the_Bell_System)].Due to monopoly, the US authorities splitted up in different Baby Bells. One of the restriction was there was a research baby bell, they couldn't really sell anything.There were computer scientists there, who did developped some Unix interesting things.  For universities you did get the source and no support for free. How to install it, no idea. In Unité d'informatique, they were lucky: they got the same computer that unix were developped on.  They got the disk by snail mail as a post-office package. They mounted it and it did spin up and they had it.\nHere, we did have a cheaper PDP11 (DEC - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PDP-11) We go the disk source from Bell Aps but we could not run it. We could look at it but that was all, because our disc format was different than the one at Bell Aps. Somebody here did write a driver for that disk and we did compiled it in l'unité d'informatique of LLN.  it did compile it but we couldn't try it because we did not have So we find the nearest Unix system compatiblewith ours, it was in Amsterdam.  Andrew Tenebaum who did write since then a number of books about operating systems and became quite an authority. He was working there. It was the young Tanenbaum, just arriving from United States to Amsterdam. He was learning to speak dutch. We did understood his english better but his assistant insisted that he speaks dutch because he will have to pass an exam in dutch. There we got a disk, than also the one with the driver we compiled, than we got here and we start using Unix.  Than in my opinion the start of open source was Unix because we had to maintain it by ourselves and we learned a lot from the sources.\nIn that time we did had to get software and it brings us to different places. For example, at the time the agents at the custom at the airport or post didn't know what to do with the discs in terms of custom clearance. They used magnetic or xrays, we had to write on the package that it should not be x-rayed. But we got time to time unreadable discs. \n\nSo it took like weeks between the transportation, the custom...\nYes, the custom had to clear the packages. I remember i've been in the customs in Zaventem. I had received a letter that my package from Bell Aps had arrived. I went there thinking i would have to pay something and go. But no. It had to be cleared so there wa some organisation that had to do administrative stuff, so i only got it a few days later. The response time was huge :)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","attribs":"|1+g*6|2+2*5+3p*6|1+1*5+4f*6|2+2+dm*6|2+2+4n*6|1+1|1+1*5+11*6|2+2+bc*6|2+2+5z*2+3e*3+1*4*3+20*4+1*6|2+2+e7*6|2+2+7n*6|2+2*5+1a*6|2+2+53*6|2+2*5+19*6|2+2+c7*6|2+2*5+1r*6|2+2+jo*6|1+1+41*6|2+2*5+1a*6|2+2+5g*6|2+2*5+2w*6|2+2+l6*6|2+2*5+1f*6|2+2+8f*5+7+kh*6|1+1+uu*0|3+9v*0*5+1r*0|3+am*6|5+5|1+1"}}},"pad:observatory.guide.jeanhuensitvextended:revs:1501":{"changeset":"Z:6hd>0|1b=64u*1=1r$","meta":{"author":"a.kqv62Q3nhchdwIuK","timestamp":1518091310349}},"pad:observatory.guide.jeanhuensitvextended:revs:1502":{"changeset":"Z:6hd>0*1=f|3=3*1=3p|1=1*1=4f|2=2*1=dm|2=2*1=4n|2=2*1=11|2=2*1=bc|2=2*1=bf|2=2*1=e7|2=2*1=7n|2=2*1=1a|2=2*1=53|2=2*1=19|2=2*1=c7|2=2*1=1r|2=2*1=jo|1=1*1=41|2=2*1=1a|2=2*1=5g|2=2*1=2w|2=2*1=l6|2=2*1=1f|2=2*1=t3|1=1*1=uu|1=1*1=9s|2=2*1=1r|1=1*1=aj$","meta":{"author":"a.kqv62Q3nhchdwIuK","timestamp":1518091315399}},"pad:observatory.guide.jeanhuensitvextended:revs:1503":{"changeset":"Z:6hd>1|1c=66m=aj*0|1+1$\n","meta":{"author":"a.kqv62Q3nhchdwIuK","timestamp":1518091316764}},"pad:observatory.guide.jeanhuensitvextended:revs:1504":{"changeset":"Z:6he>1|1d=6h6*0|1+1$\n","meta":{"author":"a.kqv62Q3nhchdwIuK","timestamp":1518091317271}},"pad:observatory.guide.jeanhuensitvextended:revs:1505":{"changeset":"Z:6hf>1|1e=6h7*0+1$Y","meta":{"author":"a.kqv62Q3nhchdwIuK","timestamp":1518091317771}},"pad:observatory.guide.jeanhuensitvextended:revs:1506":{"changeset":"Z:6hg>4|1e=6h7=1*0+4$ou

At the time computers were mainframes and you did fed them with programms by punch cards. Programing was writing down the program, than you punched it and the next day you get results, mostly error. That's the way it worked at that time. To teach us programing, they used the langage of that time, Fortran and some kind of invented assembly langage, it didn't really exist, it was simplified.\n\nMost of the time you did write down your program, the teacher and the assistant would have to tell you what is wrong or good, you didn't had much practical experience.\n\n**How was it like, tons of pages ?** \n\nNo. As an anecdocte, i remember punchcards were a block of papers, we were jealous of the people who came in the computer center with huge stacks of cards. That were really small programs, not complicated one. The fact you had to learn to use the computer from scratch, everything was new, you couldn't rely on previous experiences, everything was new. And to start with small programs was difficult enough. \n\nThat was also the time when Edsger W. Dijkstra who forked the goto... i still remember him, in an audience, giving us a lecture on modernisation in programming at the International computing symposium 1977 in Liège (programming: from craft to scientific discipline https://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/EWD/transcriptions/EWD05xx/EWD566.html). He told usxx (i'll complete it as soon as possible. i need Jean's input)\"\n\nAnd then from 75 on, computers became cheaper and could be bought by departments and smaller entities. And than came the first interactive computer. Still beasts about two cubic meters, costing two millions belgian francs. But it was low enough to allow people to type in directly commands. I started working here in 75 as a researcher, it have evolved continuously and i saw computer getting cheaper and getting easier to use.The way to use it was simplified, you could start to go to the beast and try it out.\n\nI remember more or less: you did write down the program in Fortran for instance… We always thought in the beginning that it would work and it didn't, so after a turn around you were giving it back to the operator and you have to wait half a day or a night to get the results.\n\n**What kind of program you were working on?** \n\nI remember the first program i had to write was you got three numbers, you had to make the program decide if you construct a triangle with the numbers being the sides of the triangle.\n\n**That took an afternoon to be processed ?** \n\nWell, yeah. You had to imagine how to do it which was also one problem, than you prepare the card with the punching machine and you give the package of cards to the operator who was feeeding the computer with the cards. People had the taks to fed the computers by hands, with paper, cards, than disks and it lasts onto the magnetic disks period. And after a number of hours or a night you get a listing, a piece of paper, with the results.\n\n**When where you able to record the program onto the machine?**\n\nI think that happens between 75 and 80. After the punching cards which was already a way to record the program, we had  typewriters, terminals but we could record the programs, we could store them on the computer. We had magnetic discs. IBM had number for everything, i remember the 33-30 [manufactured from 1970 on] had a magnetic disk. We didn't touch the machines, operators would change the disks, we could only access the typewriter. That was our most direct connexion to the computer. Thetimes were diffent. The mainframes were such huge costly beasts that it had operators day and night keeping it busy. Even at night there were two or three guys mounting tapes, dismounting tapes, that kind of stuff.\nhttps://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/42/IBM_magnetic_disk_drives_3330%2B3333.png/600px-IBM_magnetic_disk_drives_3330%2B3333.png\n\n**When did you stop working with operators?** \n\nSomewhere between 85 and 90. There were still operators at the main computer of the university, but there were also small computers, so researchers and student can have direct access when needed. \n\n**When did you start to work with software sold by others or gived away in order to do your research?** \n\nYou stil need an operating system on the mainframe that was delivered by IBM or the constructor delivering the mainframe. When you bought mini-computers, which were the  smaller versions of mainframes, in most cases you did buy an operating systems, compilers and all the stuff you need to be able to program those things. In most cases, because the computer sciences department did buy the mini-computer from, for instance *digital equipment corporation*,  a manufactorer of that time, but they didn't buy their software. They were not open source or free,  but you could get Unix and could run it on those digital equipment (DEC) computers. That is what the computer department of the University of Louvain la Neuve *l'unité d'informatique*, did and so did we.\n\n**When did you start working with unix as an os?** \n\nI took a trip to Amsterdam, it must have been in 1979/80… Well, the story starts in our french sister university (LLN) where they did have a PDP-11 with Unix on it https://hackadaycom.files.wordpress.com/2016/08/full-size-pdp11.jpg. You got Unix, at the time, when you were a university, from Bell Aps (Ma Bell), the american telephone company. It was a mega organisation at the time [before the [dismantlment of AT&T/Bell system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breakup_of_the_Bell_System)].Due to monopoly, the US authorities splitted up in different Baby Bells. One of the restriction was there was a research baby bell, they couldn't really sell anything.There were computer scientists there, who did developped some Unix interesting things.  For universities you did get the source and no support for free. How to install it, no idea. In Unité d'informatique, they were lucky: they got the same computer that unix were developped on.  They got the disk by snail mail as a post-office package. They mounted it and it did spin up and they had it.\nHere, we did have a cheaper PDP11 (DEC - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PDP-11) We go the disk source from Bell Aps but we could not run it. We could look at it but that was all, because our disc format was different than the one at Bell Aps. Somebody here did write a driver for that disk and we did compiled it in l'unité d'informatique of LLN.  it did compile it but we couldn't try it because we did not have So we find the nearest Unix system compatiblewith ours, it was in Amsterdam.  Andrew Tenebaum who did write since then a number of books about operating systems and became quite an authority. He was working there. It was the young Tanenbaum, just arriving from United States to Amsterdam. He was learning to speak dutch. We did understood his english better but his assistant insisted that he speaks dutch because he will have to pass an exam in dutch. There we got a disk, than also the one with the driver we compiled, than we got here and we start using Unix.  Than in my opinion the start of open source was Unix because we had to maintain it by ourselves and we learned a lot from the sources.\nIn that time we did had to get software and it brings us to different places. For example, at the time the agents at the custom at the airport or post didn't know what to do with the discs in terms of custom clearance. They used magnetic or xrays, we had to write on the package that it should not be x-rayed. But we got time to time unreadable discs. \n\nSo it took like weeks between the transportation, the custom...\nYes, the custom had to clear the packages. I remember i've been in the customs in Zaventem. I had received a letter that my package from Bell Aps had arrived. I went there thinking i would have to pay something and go. But no. It had to be cleared so there wa some organisation that had to do administrative stuff, so i only got it a few days later. The response time was huge :)\n\nThan after that period of time how did you switch from that kind of collaboration on how to make software and make software work to collabor\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","attribs":"|1+g*6|2+2*5+3p*6|1+1*5+4f*6|2+2+dm*6|2+2+4n*6|1+1|1+1*5+11*6|2+2+bc*6|2+2+5z*2+3e*3+1*4*3+20*4+1*6|2+2+e7*6|2+2+7n*6|2+2*5+1a*6|2+2+53*6|2+2*5+19*6|2+2+c7*6|2+2*5+1r*6|2+2+jo*6|1+1+41*6|2+2*5+1a*6|2+2+5g*6|2+2*5+2w*6|2+2+l6*6|2+2*5+1f*6|2+2+8f*5+7+kh*6|1+1+uu*0|1+1+9s*0|2+2*5+1r*0|1+1+aj*0|4+40*6|5+5|1+1"}}},"pad:observatory.guide.jeanhuensitvextended:revs:1601":{"changeset":"Z:6lb>4|1e=6h7=3w*0+4$atio","meta":{"author":"a.kqv62Q3nhchdwIuK","timestamp":1518091419591}},"pad:observatory.guide.jeanhuensitvextended:revs:1602":{"changeset":"Z:6lf>3|1e=6h7=40*0+3$n

__NOPUBLISH__\n\n\n**You have been using computers since a long time, as you explained us during the tour we had the joy of assisting during the TGSO.**\n**I heard that that until recently, let's say the late 1990's, when learning computer programming you had to start by  writing down the program on paper... ** \n\nIn 1973, i did study computer sciences, it was the second year of the department, here in Leuven. At the time computers were mainframes and you did fed them with programms by punch cards. Programing was writing down the program, than you punched it and the next day you get results, mostly error. That's the way it worked at that time. To teach us programing, they used the langage of that time, Fortran and some kind of invented assembly langage, it didn't really exist, it was simplified.\n\nMost of the time you did write down your program, the teacher and the assistant would have to tell you what is wrong or good, you didn't had much practical experience.\n\n**How was it like, tons of pages ?** \n\nNo. As an anecdocte, i remember punchcards were a block of papers, we were jealous of the people who came in the computer center with huge stacks of cards. That were really small programs, not complicated one. The fact you had to learn to use the computer from scratch, everything was new, you couldn't rely on previous experiences, everything was new. And to start with small programs was difficult enough. \n\nThat was also the time when Edsger W. Dijkstra who forked the goto... i still remember him, in an audience, giving us a lecture on modernisation in programming at the International computing symposium 1977 in Liège (programming: from craft to scientific discipline https://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/EWD/transcriptions/EWD05xx/EWD566.html). He told usxx (i'll complete it as soon as possible. i need Jean's input)\"\n\nAnd then from 75 on, computers became cheaper and could be bought by departments and smaller entities. And than came the first interactive computer. Still beasts about two cubic meters, costing two millions belgian francs. But it was low enough to allow people to type in directly commands. I started working here in 75 as a researcher, it have evolved continuously and i saw computer getting cheaper and getting easier to use.The way to use it was simplified, you could start to go to the beast and try it out.\n\nI remember more or less: you did write down the program in Fortran for instance… We always thought in the beginning that it would work and it didn't, so after a turn around you were giving it back to the operator and you have to wait half a day or a night to get the results.\n\n**What kind of program you were working on?** \n\nI remember the first program i had to write was you got three numbers, you had to make the program decide if you construct a triangle with the numbers being the sides of the triangle.\n\n**That took an afternoon to be processed ?** \n\nWell, yeah. You had to imagine how to do it which was also one problem, than you prepare the card with the punching machine and you give the package of cards to the operator who was feeeding the computer with the cards. People had the taks to fed the computers by hands, with paper, cards, than disks and it lasts onto the magnetic disks period. And after a number of hours or a night you get a listing, a piece of paper, with the results.\n\n**When where you able to record the program onto the machine?**\n\nI think that happens between 75 and 80. After the punching cards which was already a way to record the program, we had  typewriters, terminals but we could record the programs, we could store them on the computer. We had magnetic discs. IBM had number for everything, i remember the 33-30 [manufactured from 1970 on] had a magnetic disk. We didn't touch the machines, operators would change the disks, we could only access the typewriter. That was our most direct connexion to the computer. Thetimes were diffent. The mainframes were such huge costly beasts that it had operators day and night keeping it busy. Even at night there were two or three guys mounting tapes, dismounting tapes, that kind of stuff.\nhttps://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/42/IBM_magnetic_disk_drives_3330%2B3333.png/600px-IBM_magnetic_disk_drives_3330%2B3333.png\n\n**When did you stop working with operators?** \n\nSomewhere between 85 and 90. There were still operators at the main computer of the university, but there were also small computers, so researchers and student can have direct access when needed. \n\n**When did you start to work with software sold by others or gived away in order to do your research?** \n\nYou stil need an operating system on the mainframe that was delivered by IBM or the constructor delivering the mainframe. When you bought mini-computers, which were the  smaller versions of mainframes, in most cases you did buy an operating systems, compilers and all the stuff you need to be able to program those things. In most cases, because the computer sciences department did buy the mini-computer from, for instance *digital equipment corporation*,  a manufactorer of that time, but they didn't buy their software. They were not open source or free,  but you could get Unix and could run it on those digital equipment (DEC) computers. That is what the computer department of the University of Louvain la Neuve *l'unité d'informatique*, did and so did we.\n\n**When did you start working with unix as an os?** \n\nI took a trip to Amsterdam, it must have been in 1979/80… Well, the story starts in our french sister university (LLN) where they did have a PDP-11 with Unix on it https://hackadaycom.files.wordpress.com/2016/08/full-size-pdp11.jpg. You got Unix, at the time, when you were a university, from Bell Aps (Ma Bell), the american telephone company. It was a mega organisation at the time [before the [dismantlment of AT&T/Bell system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breakup_of_the_Bell_System)].Due to monopoly, the US authorities splitted up in different Baby Bells. One of the restriction was there was a research baby bell, they couldn't really sell anything.There were computer scientists there, who did developped some Unix interesting things.  For universities you did get the source and no support for free. How to install it, no idea. In Unité d'informatique, they were lucky: they got the same computer that unix were developped on.  They got the disk by snail mail as a post-office package. They mounted it and it did spin up and they had it.\nHere, we did have a cheaper PDP11 (DEC - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PDP-11) We go the disk source from Bell Aps but we could not run it. We could look at it but that was all, because our disc format was different than the one at Bell Aps. Somebody here did write a driver for that disk and we did compiled it in l'unité d'informatique of LLN.  it did compile it but we couldn't try it because we did not have So we find the nearest Unix system compatiblewith ours, it was in Amsterdam.  Andrew Tenebaum who did write since then a number of books about operating systems and became quite an authority. He was working there. It was the young Tanenbaum, just arriving from United States to Amsterdam. He was learning to speak dutch. We did understood his english better but his assistant insisted that he speaks dutch because he will have to pass an exam in dutch. There we got a disk, than also the one with the driver we compiled, than we got here and we start using Unix.  Than in my opinion the start of open source was Unix because we had to maintain it by ourselves and we learned a lot from the sources.\nIn that time we did had to get software and it brings us to different places. For example, at the time the agents at the custom at the airport or post didn't know what to do with the discs in terms of custom clearance. They used magnetic or xrays, we had to write on the package that it should not be x-rayed. But we got time to time unreadable discs. \n\n**So it took like weeks between the transportation, the custom...**\nYes, the custom had to clear the packages. I remember i've been in the customs in Zaventem. I had received a letter that my package from Bell Aps had arrived. I went there thinking i would have to pay something and go. But no. It had to be cleared so there wa some organisation that had to do administrative stuff, so i only got it a few days later. The response time was huge :)\n\n**Than after that period of time how did you switch from that kind of collaboration on how to make software and make software work to collaboration on networks, between universities and researchers...**\nIn the Unix system of that time there was a kind of networking protocol which only did work on serial lines.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","attribs":"|1+g*6|2+2*5+3p*6|1+1*5+4f*6|2+2+dm*6|2+2+4n*6|1+1|1+1*5+11*6|2+2+bc*6|2+2+5z*2+3e*3+1*4*3+20*4+1*6|2+2+e7*6|2+2+7n*6|2+2*5+1a*6|2+2+53*6|2+2*5+19*6|2+2+c7*6|2+2*5+1r*6|2+2+jo*6|1+1+41*6|2+2*5+1a*6|2+2+5g*6|2+2*5+2w*6|2+2+l6*6|2+2*5+1f*6|2+2+8f*5+7+kh*6|1+1+uu*0|1+1+9s*0|2+2*5+1v*0|1+1+aj*0|2+2*5+5m*0|2+32*6|5+5|1+1"}}},"pad:observatory.guide.jeanhuensitvextended:revs:1701":{"changeset":"Z:6q5>1|1g=6pz*0+1$

the joy of assisting during the TGSO.**\n**I heard that that until recently, let's say the late 1990's, when learning computer programming you had to start by  writing down the program on paper... ** \n\nIn 1973, i did study computer sciences, it was the second year of the department, here in Leuven. At the time computers were mainframes and you did fed them with programms by punch cards. Programing was writing down the program, than you punched it and the next day you get results, mostly error. That's the way it worked at that time. To teach us programing, they used the langage of that time, Fortran and some kind of invented assembly langage, it didn't really exist, it was simplified.\n\nMost of the time you did write down your program, the teacher and the assistant would have to tell you what is wrong or good, you didn't had much practical experience.\n\n**How was it like, tons of pages ?** \n\nNo. As an anecdocte, i remember punchcards were a block of papers, we were jealous of the people who came in the computer center with huge stacks of cards. That were really small programs, not complicated one. The fact you had to learn to use the computer from scratch, everything was new, you couldn't rely on previous experiences, everything was new. And to start with small programs was difficult enough. \n\nThat was also the time when Edsger W. Dijkstra who forked the goto... i still remember him, in an audience, giving us a lecture on modernisation in programming at the International computing symposium 1977 in Liège (programming: from craft to scientific discipline https://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/EWD/transcriptions/EWD05xx/EWD566.html). He told usxx (i'll complete it as soon as possible. i need Jean's input)\"\n\nAnd then from 75 on, computers became cheaper and could be bought by departments and smaller entities. And than came the first interactive computer. Still beasts about two cubic meters, costing two millions belgian francs. But it was low enough to allow people to type in directly commands. I started working here in 75 as a researcher, it have evolved continuously and i saw computer getting cheaper and getting easier to use.The way to use it was simplified, you could start to go to the beast and try it out.\n\nI remember more or less: you did write down the program in Fortran for instance… We always thought in the beginning that it would work and it didn't, so after a turn around you were giving it back to the operator and you have to wait half a day or a night to get the results.\n\n**What kind of program you were working on?** \n\nI remember the first program i had to write was you got three numbers, you had to make the program decide if you construct a triangle with the numbers being the sides of the triangle.\n\n**That took an afternoon to be processed ?** \n\nWell, yeah. You had to imagine how to do it which was also one problem, than you prepare the card with the punching machine and you give the package of cards to the operator who was feeeding the computer with the cards. People had the taks to fed the computers by hands, with paper, cards, than disks and it lasts onto the magnetic disks period. And after a number of hours or a night you get a listing, a piece of paper, with the results.\n\n**When where you able to record the program onto the machine?**\n\nI think that happens between 75 and 80. After the punching cards which was already a way to record the program, we had  typewriters, terminals but we could record the programs, we could store them on the computer. We had magnetic discs. IBM had number for everything, i remember the 33-30 [manufactured from 1970 on] had a magnetic disk. We didn't touch the machines, operators would change the disks, we could only access the typewriter. That was our most direct connexion to the computer. Thetimes were diffent. The mainframes were such huge costly beasts that it had operators day and night keeping it busy. Even at night there were two or three guys mounting tapes, dismounting tapes, that kind of stuff.\nhttps://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/42/IBM_magnetic_disk_drives_3330%2B3333.png/600px-IBM_magnetic_disk_drives_3330%2B3333.png\n\n**When did you stop working with operators?** \n\nSomewhere between 85 and 90. There were still operators at the main computer of the university, but there were also small computers, so researchers and student can have direct access when needed. \n\n**When did you start to work with software sold by others or gived away in order to do your research?** \n\nYou stil need an operating system on the mainframe that was delivered by IBM or the constructor delivering the mainframe. When you bought mini-computers, which were the  smaller versions of mainframes, in most cases you did buy an operating systems, compilers and all the stuff you need to be able to program those things. In most cases, because the computer sciences department did buy the mini-computer from, for instance *digital equipment corporation*,  a manufactorer of that time, but they didn't buy their software. They were not open source or free,  but you could get Unix and could run it on those digital equipment (DEC) computers. That is what the computer department of the University of Louvain la Neuve *l'unité d'informatique*, did and so did we.\n\n**When did you start working with unix as an os?** \n\nI took a trip to Amsterdam, it must have been in 1979/80… Well, the story starts in our french sister university (LLN) where they did have a PDP-11 with Unix on it https://hackadaycom.files.wordpress.com/2016/08/full-size-pdp11.jpg. You got Unix, at the time, when you were a university, from Bell Aps (Ma Bell), the american telephone company. It was a mega organisation at the time [before the [dismantlment of AT&T/Bell system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breakup_of_the_Bell_System)].Due to monopoly, the US authorities splitted up in different Baby Bells. One of the restriction was there was a research baby bell, they couldn't really sell anything.There were computer scientists there, who did developped some Unix interesting things.  For universities you did get the source and no support for free. How to install it, no idea. In Unité d'informatique, they were lucky: they got the same computer that unix were developped on.  They got the disk by snail mail as a post-office package. They mounted it and it did spin up and they had it.\nHere, we did have a cheaper PDP11 (DEC - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PDP-11) We go the disk source from Bell Aps but we could not run it. We could look at it but that was all, because our disc format was different than the one at Bell Aps. Somebody here did write a driver for that disk and we did compiled it in l'unité d'informatique of LLN.  it did compile it but we couldn't try it because we did not have So we find the nearest Unix system compatiblewith ours, it was in Amsterdam.  Andrew Tenebaum who did write since then a number of books about operating systems and became quite an authority. He was working there. It was the young Tanenbaum, just arriving from United States to Amsterdam. He was learning to speak dutch. We did understood his english better but his assistant insisted that he speaks dutch because he will have to pass an exam in dutch. There we got a disk, than also the one with the driver we compiled, than we got here and we start using Unix.  Than in my opinion the start of open source was Unix because we had to maintain it by ourselves and we learned a lot from the sources.\nIn that time we did had to get software and it brings us to different places. For example, at the time the agents at the custom at the airport or post didn't know what to do with the discs in terms of custom clearance. They used magnetic or xrays, we had to write on the package that it should not be x-rayed. But we got time to time unreadable discs. \n\n**So it took like weeks between the transportation, the custom...**\nYes, the custom had to clear the packages. I remember i've been in the customs in Zaventem. I had received a letter that my package from Bell Aps had arrived. I went there thinking i would have to pay something and go. But no. It had to be cleared so there wa some organisation that had to do administrative stuff, so i only got it a few days later.

the joy of assisting during the TGSO.**\n**I heard that that until recently, let's say the late 1990's, when learning computer programming you had to start by  writing down the program on paper... ** \n\nIn 1973, i did study computer sciences, it was the second year of the department, here in Leuven. At the time computers were mainframes and you did fed them with programms by punch cards. Programing was writing down the program, than you punched it and the next day you get results, mostly error. That's the way it worked at that time. To teach us programing, they used the langage of that time, Fortran and some kind of invented assembly langage, it didn't really exist, it was simplified.\n\nMost of the time you did write down your program, the teacher and the assistant would have to tell you what is wrong or good, you didn't had much practical experience.\n\n**How was it like, tons of pages ?** \n\nNo. As an anecdocte, i remember punchcards were a block of papers, we were jealous of the people who came in the computer center with huge stacks of cards. That were really small programs, not complicated one. The fact you had to learn to use the computer from scratch, everything was new, you couldn't rely on previous experiences, everything was new. And to start with small programs was difficult enough. \n\nThat was also the time when Edsger W. Dijkstra who forked the goto... i still remember him, in an audience, giving us a lecture on modernisation in programming at the International computing symposium 1977 in Liège (programming: from craft to scientific discipline https://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/EWD/transcriptions/EWD05xx/EWD566.html). He told usxx (i'll complete it as soon as possible. i need Jean's input)\"\n\nAnd then from 75 on, computers became cheaper and could be bought by departments and smaller entities. And than came the first interactive computer. Still beasts about two cubic meters, costing two millions belgian francs. But it was low enough to allow people to type in directly commands. I started working here in 75 as a researcher, it have evolved continuously and i saw computer getting cheaper and getting easier to use.The way to use it was simplified, you could start to go to the beast and try it out.\n\nI remember more or less: you did write down the program in Fortran for instance… We always thought in the beginning that it would work and it didn't, so after a turn around you were giving it back to the operator and you have to wait half a day or a night to get the results.\n\n**What kind of program you were working on?** \n\nI remember the first program i had to write was you got three numbers, you had to make the program decide if you construct a triangle with the numbers being the sides of the triangle.\n\n**That took an afternoon to be processed ?** \n\nWell, yeah. You had to imagine how to do it which was also one problem, than you prepare the card with the punching machine and you give the package of cards to the operator who was feeeding the computer with the cards. People had the taks to fed the computers by hands, with paper, cards, than disks and it lasts onto the magnetic disks period. And after a number of hours or a night you get a listing, a piece of paper, with the results.\n\n**When where you able to record the program onto the machine?**\n\nI think that happens between 75 and 80. After the punching cards which was already a way to record the program, we had  typewriters, terminals but we could record the programs, we could store them on the computer. We had magnetic discs. IBM had number for everything, i remember the 33-30 [manufactured from 1970 on] had a magnetic disk. We didn't touch the machines, operators would change the disks, we could only access the typewriter. That was our most direct connexion to the computer. Thetimes were diffent. The mainframes were such huge costly beasts that it had operators day and night keeping it busy. Even at night there were two or three guys mounting tapes, dismounting tapes, that kind of stuff.\nhttps://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/42/IBM_magnetic_disk_drives_3330%2B3333.png/600px-IBM_magnetic_disk_drives_3330%2B3333.png\n\n**When did you stop working with operators?** \n\nSomewhere between 85 and 90. There were still operators at the main computer of the university, but there were also small computers, so researchers and student can have direct access when needed. \n\n**When did you start to work with software sold by others or gived away in order to do your research?** \n\nYou stil need an operating system on the mainframe that was delivered by IBM or the constructor delivering the mainframe. When you bought mini-computers, which were the  smaller versions of mainframes, in most cases you did buy an operating systems, compilers and all the stuff you need to be able to program those things. In most cases, because the computer sciences department did buy the mini-computer from, for instance *digital equipment corporation*,  a manufactorer of that time, but they didn't buy their software. They were not open source or free,  but you could get Unix and could run it on those digital equipment (DEC) computers. That is what the computer department of the University of Louvain la Neuve *l'unité d'informatique*, did and so did we.\n\n**When did you start working with unix as an os?** \n\nI took a trip to Amsterdam, it must have been in 1979/80… Well, the story starts in our french sister university (LLN) where they did have a PDP-11 with Unix on it https://hackadaycom.files.wordpress.com/2016/08/full-size-pdp11.jpg. You got Unix, at the time, when you were a university, from Bell Aps (Ma Bell), the american telephone company. It was a mega organisation at the time [before the [dismantlment of AT&T/Bell system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breakup_of_the_Bell_System)].Due to monopoly, the US authorities splitted up in different Baby Bells. One of the restriction was there was a research baby bell, they couldn't really sell anything.There were computer scientists there, who did developped some Unix interesting things.  For universities you did get the source and no support for free. How to install it, no idea. In Unité d'informatique, they were lucky: they got the same computer that unix were developped on.  They got the disk by snail mail as a post-office package. They mounted it and it did spin up and they had it.\nHere, we did have a cheaper PDP11 (DEC - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PDP-11) We go the disk source from Bell Aps but we could not run it. We could look at it but that was all, because our disc format was different than the one at Bell Aps. Somebody here did write a driver for that disk and we did compiled it in l'unité d'informatique of LLN.  it did compile it but we couldn't try it because we did not have So we find the nearest Unix system compatiblewith ours, it was in Amsterdam.  Andrew Tenebaum who did write since then a number of books about operating systems and became quite an authority. He was working there. It was the young Tanenbaum, just arriving from United States to Amsterdam. He was learning to speak dutch. We did understood his english better but his assistant insisted that he speaks dutch because he will have to pass an exam in dutch. There we got a disk, than also the one with the driver we compiled, than we got here and we start using Unix.  Than in my opinion the start of open source was Unix because we had to maintain it by ourselves and we learned a lot from the sources.\nIn that time we did had to get software and it brings us to different places. For example, at the time the agents at the custom at the airport or post didn't know what to do with the discs in terms of custom clearance. They used magnetic or xrays, we had to write on the package that it should not be x-rayed. But we got time to time unreadable discs. \n\n**So it took like weeks between the transportation, the custom...**\nYes, the custom had to clear the packages. I remember i've been in the customs in Zaventem. I had received a letter that my package from Bell Aps had arrived. I went there thinking i would have to pay something and go. But no. It had to be cleared so there wa some organisation that had to do administrative stuff, so i only got it a few days later. The response time was huge :)\n\n**Than after that period of time how did you switch from that kind of collaboration on how to make software and make software work to collaboration on networks, between universities and researchers...**\nIn the Unix system of that time there was a kind of networking protocol which only did work on serial lines.\n You could connect two unix systems together you only need a line. We had one between LLN and Leuven, it's only 15 kms, but we had to ask Belgacom, than La Régie des télégraphes et téléphones, to get a modem to connect through their network and than over that modem you could reach an amazing speed of 300 characters per second. And that

joy of assisting during the TGSO.**\n**I heard that that until recently, let's say the late 1990's, when learning computer programming you had to start by  writing down the program on paper... ** \n\nIn 1973, i did study computer sciences, it was the second year of the department, here in Leuven. At the time computers were mainframes and you did fed them with programms by punch cards. Programing was writing down the program, than you punched it and the next day you get results, mostly error. That's the way it worked at that time. To teach us programing, they used the langage of that time, Fortran and some kind of invented assembly langage, it didn't really exist, it was simplified.\n\nMost of the time you did write down your program, the teacher and the assistant would have to tell you what is wrong or good, you didn't had much practical experience.\n\n*How was it like, tons of pages ?** \n\nNo. As an anecdocte, i remember punchcards were a block of papers, we were jealous of the people who came in the computer center with huge stacks of cards. That were really small programs, not complicated one. The fact you had to learn to use the computer from scratch, everything was new, you couldn't rely on previous experiences, everything was new. And to start with small programs was difficult enough. \n\nThat was also the time when Edsger W. Dijkstra who forked the goto... i still remember him, in an audience, giving us a lecture on modernisation in programming at the International computing symposium 1977 in Liège (programming: from craft to scientific discipline https://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/EWD/transcriptions/EWD05xx/EWD566.html). He told usxx (i'll complete it as soon as possible. i need Jean's input)\"\n\nAnd then from 75 on, computers became cheaper and could be bought by departments and smaller entities. And than came the first interactive computer. Still beasts about two cubic meters, costing two millions belgian francs. But it was low enough to allow people to type in directly commands. I started working here in 75 as a researcher, it have evolved continuously and i saw computer getting cheaper and getting easier to use.The way to use it was simplified, you could start to go to the beast and try it out.\n\nI remember more or less: you did write down the program in Fortran for instance… We always thought in the beginning that it would work and it didn't, so after a turn around you were giving it back to the operator and you have to wait half a day or a night to get the results.\n\n**What kind of program you were working on? ** \n\nI remember the first program i had to work on.

At the time computers were mainframes and you did fed them with programms by punch cards. Programing was writing down the program, than you punched it and the next day you get results, mostly error. That's the way it worked at that time. To teach us programing, they used the langage of that time, Fortran and some kind of invented assembly langage, it didn't really exist, it was simplified.\n\nMost of the time you did write down your program, the teacher and the assistant would have to tell you what is wrong or good, you didn't had much practical experience.\n\n**How was it like, tons of pages ?** \n\nNo. As an anecdocte, i remember punchcards were a block of papers, we were jealous of the people who came in the computer center with huge stacks of cards. That were really small programs, not complicated one. The fact you had to learn to use the computer from scratch, everything was new, you couldn't rely on previous experiences, everything was new. And to start with small programs was difficult enough. \n\nThat was also the time when Edsger W. Dijkstra who forked the goto... i still remember him, in an audience, giving us a lecture on modernisation in programming at the International computing symposium 1977 in Liège (programming: from craft to scientific discipline https://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/EWD/transcriptions/EWD05xx/EWD566.html). He told usxx (i'll complete it as soon as possible. i need Jean's input)\"\n\nAnd then from 75 on, computers became cheaper and could be bought by departments and smaller entities. And than came the first interactive computer. Still beasts about two cubic meters, costing two millions belgian francs. But it was low enough to allow people to type in directly commands. I started working here in 75 as a researcher, it have evolved continuously and i saw computer getting cheaper and getting easier to use.The way to use it was simplified, you could start to go to the beast and try it out.\n\nI remember more or less: you did write down the program in Fortran for instance… We always thought in the beginning that it would work and it didn't, so after a turn around you were giving it back to the operator and you have to wait half a day or a night to get the results.\n\n**What kind of program you were working on?** \n\nI remember the first program i had to write was you got three numbers, you had to make the program decide if you construct a triangle with the numbers being the sides of the triangle.\n\n**That took an afternoon to be processed ?** \n\nWell, yeah.

That is what the computer department of the University of Louvain la Neuve *l'unité d'informatique*, did and so did we.\n\n**When did you start working with unix as an os?** \n\nI took a trip to Amsterdam, it must have been in 1979/80… Well, the story starts in our french sister university (LLN) where they did have a PDP-11 with Unix on it https://hackadaycom.files.wordpress.com/2016/08/full-size-pdp11.jpg. You got Unix, at the time, when you were a university, from Bell Aps (Ma Bell), the american telephone company. It was a mega organisation at the time [before the [dismantlment of AT&T/Bell system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breakup_of_the_Bell_System)].Due to monopoly, the US authorities splitted up in different Baby Bells. One of the restriction was there was a research baby bell, they couldn't really sell anything.There were computer scientists there, who did developped some Unix interesting things.  For universities you did get the source and no support for free. How to install it, no idea. In Unité d'informatique, they were lucky: they got the same computer that unix were developped on.  They got the disk by snail mail as a post-office package. They mounted it and it did spin up and they had it.\nHere, we did have a cheaper PDP11 (DEC - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PDP-11) We go the disk source from Bell Aps but we could not run it. We could look at it but that was all, because our disc format was different than the one at Bell Aps. Somebody here did write a driver for that disk and we did compiled it in l'unité d'informatique of LLN.  it did compile it but we couldn't try it because we did not have So we find the nearest Unix system compatiblewith ours, it was in Amsterdam.  Andrew Tenebaum who did write since then a number of books about operating systems and became quite an authority. He was working there. It was the young Tanenbaum, just arriving from United States to Amsterdam. He was learning to speak dutch. We did understood his english better but his assistant insisted that he speaks dutch because he will have to pass an exam in dutch. There we got a disk, than also the one with the driver we compiled, than we got here and we start using Unix.  Than in my opinion the start of open source was Unix because we had to maintain it by ourselves and we learned a lot from the sources.\nIn that time we did had to get software and it brings us to different places. For example, at the time the agents at the custom at the airport or post didn't know what to do with the discs in terms of custom clearance. They used magnetic or xrays, we had to write on the package that it should not be x-rayed. But we got time to time unreadable discs. \n\n**So it took like weeks between the transportation, the custom...**\nYes, the custom had to clear the packages. I remember i've been in the customs in Zaventem. I had received a letter that my package from Bell Aps had arrived. I went there thinking i would have to pay something and go. But no. It had to be cleared so there wa some organisation that had to do administrative stuff, so i only got it a few days later. The response time was huge :)\n\n**Than after that period of time how did you switch from that kind of collaboration on how to make software and make software work to collaboration on networks, between universities and researchers...**\nIn the Unix system of that time there was a kind of networking protocol which only did work on serial lines.\n You could connect two unix systems together you only need a line. We had one between LLN and Leuven, it's only 15 kms, but we had to ask Belgacom, than La Régie des télégraphes et téléphones, to get a modem to connect through their network and than over that modem you could reach an amazing speed of 300 characters per second. And that was the first communications. It did happened between somewhere around 85. And then you could have connexion between two computers, writing something here and do  soemthing there and we \n\n\n\n\n\n","attribs":"|1+g*6|2+2*5+3p*6|1+1*5+4f*6|2+2+dm*6|2+2+4n*6|1+1|1+1*5+11*6|2+2+bc*6|2+2+5z*2+3e*3+1*4*3+20*4+1*6|2+2+e7*6|2+2+7n*6|2+2*5+1a*6|2+2+53*6|2+2*5+19*6|2+2+c7*6|2+2*5+1r*6|2+2+jo*6|1+1+41*6|2+2*5+1a*6|2+2+5g*6|2+2*5+2w*6|2+2+l6*6|2+2*5+1f*6|2+2+8f*5+7+kh*6|1+1+uu*0|1+1+9s*0|2+2*5+1v*0|1+1+aj*0|2+2*5+5m*0|1+1+30*0|1+1+48*2+15+3r*0+5g*6|5+5|1+1"}}},"pad:observatory.guide.jeanhuensitvextended:revs:2001":{"changeset":"Z:74p>5|1g=6pz=ek*0+5$could","meta":{"author":"a.kqv62Q3nhchdwIuK","timestamp":1518091869130}},"pad:observatory.guide.jeanhuensitvextended:revs:2002":{"changeset":"Z:74u>1|1g=6pz=ep*0+1$ ","meta":{"author":"a.kqv62Q3nhchdwIuK","timestamp":1518091869630}},"pad:observatory.guide.jeanhuensitvextended:revs:2003":{"changeset":"Z:74v>3|1g=6pz=eq*0+3$sen","meta":{"author":"a.kqv62Q3nhchdwIuK","timestamp":1518091870130}},"pad:observatory.guide.jeanhuensitvextended:revs:2004":{"changeset":"Z:74y>1|1g=6pz=et*0+1$d","meta":{"author":"a.kqv62Q3nhchdwIuK","timestamp":1518091870774}},"pad:observatory.guide.jeanhuensitvextended:revs:2005":{"changeset":"Z:74z>1|1g=6pz=eu*0+1$ ","meta":{"author":"a.kqv62Q3nhchdwIuK","timestamp":1518091871298}},"pad:observatory.guide.jeanhuensitvextended:revs:2006":{"changeset":"Z:750>3|1g=6pz=ev*0+3$pro","meta":{"author":"a.kqv62Q3nhchdwIuK","timestamp":1518091871801}},"pad:observatory.guide.jeanhuensitvextended:revs:2007":{"changeset":"Z:753>2|1g=6pz=ey*0+2$gr","meta":{"author":"a.kqv62Q3nhchdwIuK","timestamp":1518091872300}},"pad:observatory.guide.jeanhuensitvextended:revs:2008":{"changeset":"Z:755>2|1g=6pz=f0*0+2$am","meta":{"author":"a.kqv62Q3nhchdwIuK","timestamp":1518091872800}},"pad:observatory.guide.jeanhuensitvextended:revs:2009":{"changeset":"Z:757>3|1g=6pz=f2*0+3$s t","meta":{"author":"a.kqv62Q3nhchdwIuK","timestamp":1518091873300}},"pad:observatory.guide.jeanhuensitvextended:revs:201":{"changeset":"Z:4d7>1|19=44x=85*0+1$A","meta":{"author":"a.kqv62Q3nhchdwIuK","timestamp":1518017109240}},"pad:observatory.guide.jeanhuensitvextended:revs:2010":{"changeset":"Z:75a>3|1g=6pz=f5*0+3$o e","meta":{"author":"a.kqv62Q3nhchdwIuK","timestamp":1518091873838}},"pad:observatory.guide.jeanhuensitvextended:revs:2011":{"changeset":"Z:75d>4|1g=6pz=f8*0+4$ach ","meta":{"author":"a.kqv62Q3nhchdwIuK","timestamp":1518091874390}},"pad:observatory.guide.jeanhuensitvextended:revs:2012":{"changeset":"Z:75h>1|1g=6pz=fc*0+1$o","meta":{"author":"a.kqv62Q3nhchdwIuK","timestamp":1518091874894}},"pad:observatory.guide.jeanhuensitvextended:revs:2013":{"changeset":"Z:75i>3|1g=6pz=fd*0+3$the","meta":{"author":"a.kqv62Q3nhchdwIuK","timestamp":1518091875394}},"pad:observatory.guide.jeanhuensitvextended:revs:2014":{"changeset":"Z:75l>1|1g=6pz=fg*0+1$r","meta":{"author":"a.kqv62Q3nhchdwIuK","timestamp":1518091875895}},"pad:observatory.guide.jeanhuensitvextended:revs:2015":{"changeset":"Z:75m>2|1g=6pz=fh*0+2$.

the joy of assisting during the TGSO.**\n**I heard that that until recently, let's say the late 1990's, when learning computer programming you had to start by  writing down the program on paper... ** \n\nIn 1973, i did study computer sciences, it was the second year of the department, here in Leuven. At the time computers were mainframes and you did fed them with programms by punch cards. Programing was writing down the program, than you punched it and the next day you get results, mostly error. That's the way it worked at that time. To teach us programing, they used the langage of that time, Fortran and some kind of invented assembly langage, it didn't really exist, it was simplified.\n\nMost of the time you did write down your program, the teacher and the assistant would have to tell you what is wrong or good, you didn't had much practical experience.\n\n**How was it like, tons of pages ?** \n\nNo. As an anecdocte, i remember punchcards were a block of papers, we were jealous of the people who came in the computer center with huge stacks of cards. That were really small programs, not complicated one. The fact you had to learn to use the computer from scratch, everything was new, you couldn't rely on previous experiences, everything was new. And to start with small programs was difficult enough. \n\nThat was also the time when Edsger W. Dijkstra who forked the goto... i still remember him, in an audience, giving us a lecture on modernisation in programming at the International computing symposium 1977 in Liège (programming: from craft to scientific discipline https://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/EWD/transcriptions/EWD05xx/EWD566.html). He told usxx (i'll complete it as soon as possible. i need Jean's input)\"\n\nAnd then from 75 on, computers became cheaper and could be bought by departments and smaller entities. And than came the first interactive computer. Still beasts about two cubic meters, costing two millions belgian francs. But it was low enough to allow people to type in directly commands. I started working here in 75 as a researcher, it have evolved continuously and i saw computer getting cheaper and getting easier to use.The way to use it was simplified, you could start to go to the beast and try it out.\n\nI remember more or less: you did write down the program in Fortran for instance… We always thought in the beginning that it would work and it didn't, so after a turn around you were giving it back to the operator and you have to wait half a day or a night to get the results.\n\n**What kind of program you were working on?** \n\nI remember the first program i had to write was you got three numbers, you had to make the program decide if you construct a triangle with the numbers being the sides of the triangle.\n\n**That took an afternoon to be processed ?** \n\nWell, yeah. You had to imagine how to do it which was also one problem, than you prepare the card with the punching machine and you give the package of cards to the operator who was feeeding the computer with the cards. People had the taks to fed the computers by hands, with paper, cards, than disks and it lasts onto the magnetic disks period. And after a number of hours or a night you get a listing, a piece of paper, with the results.\n\n**When where you able to record the program onto the machine?**\n\nI think that happens between 75 and 80. After the punching cards which was already a way to record the program, we had  typewriters, terminals but we could record the programs, we could store them on the computer. We had magnetic discs. IBM had number for everything, i remember the 33-30 [manufactured from 1970 on] had a magnetic disk. We didn't touch the machines, operators would change the disks, we could only access the typewriter. That was our most direct connexion to the computer. Thetimes were diffent. The mainframes were such huge costly beasts that it had operators day and night keeping it busy. Even at night there were two or three guys mounting tapes, dismounting tapes, that kind of stuff.\nhttps://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/42/IBM_magnetic_disk_drives_3330%2B3333.png/600px-IBM_magnetic_disk_drives_3330%2B3333.png\n\n**When did you stop working with operators?** \n\nSomewhere between 85 and 90. There were still operators at the main computer of the university, but there were also small computers, so researchers and student can have direct access when needed. \n\n**When did you start to work with software sold by others or gived away in order to do your research?** \n\nYou stil need an operating system on the mainframe that was delivered by IBM or the constructor delivering the mainframe. When you bought mini-computers, which were the  smaller versions of mainframes, in most cases you did buy an operating systems, compilers and all the stuff you need to be able to program those things. In most cases, because the computer sciences department did buy the mini-computer from, for instance *digital equipment corporation*,  a manufactorer of that time, but they didn't buy their software. They were not open source or free,  but you could get Unix and could run it on those digital equipment (DEC) computers. That is what the computer department of the University of Louvain la Neuve *l'unité d'informatique*, did and so did we.\n\n**When did you start working with unix as an os?** \n\nI took a trip to Amsterdam, it must have been in 1979/80… Well, the story starts in our french sister university (LLN) where they did have a PDP-11 with Unix on it https://hackadaycom.files.wordpress.com/2016/08/full-size-pdp11.jpg. You got Unix, at the time, when you were a university, from Bell Aps (Ma Bell), the american telephone company. It was a mega organisation at the time [before the [dismantlment of AT&T/Bell system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breakup_of_the_Bell_System)].Due to monopoly, the US authorities splitted up in different Baby Bells. One of the restriction was there was a research baby bell, they couldn't really sell anything.There were computer scientists there, who did developped some Unix interesting things.  For universities you did get the source and no support for free. How to install it, no idea. In Unité d'informatique, they were lucky: they got the same computer that unix were developped on.  They got the disk by snail mail as a post-office package. They mounted it and it did spin up and they had it.\nHere, we did have a cheaper PDP11 (DEC - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PDP-11) We go the disk source from Bell Aps but we could not run it. We could look at it but that was all, because our disc format was different than the one at Bell Aps. Somebody here did write a driver for that disk and we did compiled it in l'unité d'informatique of LLN.  it did compile it but we couldn't try it because we did not have So we find the nearest Unix system compatiblewith ours, it was in Amsterdam.  Andrew Tenebaum who did write since then a number of books about operating systems and became quite an authority. He was working there. It was the young Tanenbaum, just arriving from United States to Amsterdam. He was learning to speak dutch. We did understood his english better but his assistant insisted that he speaks dutch because he will have to pass an exam in dutch. There we got a disk, than also the one with the driver we compiled, than we got here and we start using Unix.  Than in my opinion the start of open source was Unix because we had to maintain it by ourselves and we learned a lot from the sources.\nIn that time we did had to get software and it brings us to different places. For example, at the time the agents at the custom at the airport or post didn't know what to do with the discs in terms of custom clearance. They used magnetic or xrays, we had to write on the package that it should not be x-rayed. But we got time to time unreadable discs. \n\n**So it took like weeks between the transportation, the custom...**\nYes, the custom had to clear the packages. I remember i've been in the customs in Zaventem. I had received a letter that my package from Bell Aps had arrived. I went there thinking i would have to pay something and go. But no. It had to be cleared so there wa some organisation that had to do administrative stuff, so i only got it a few days later. The response time was huge :)\n\n**Than after that period of time how did you switch from that kind of collaboration on how to make software and make software work to collaboration on networks, between universities and researchers...**\nIn the Unix system of that time there was a kind of networking protocol which only did work on serial lines.\n You could connect two unix systems together you only need a line. We had one between LLN and Leuven, it's only 15 kms, but we had to ask Belgacom, than La Régie des télégraphes et téléphones, to get a modem to connect through their network and than over that modem you could reach an amazing speed of 300 characters per second. And that was the first communications. It did happened between somewhere around 85. And then you could have connexion between two computers, writing something here and do  soemthing there and we could send programs to each other.

__NOPUBLISH__\n\n\n**You have been using computers since a long time, as you explained us during the tour we had the joy of assisting during the TGSO.**\n**I heard that that until recently, let's say the late 1990's, when learning computer programming you had to start by  writing down the program on paper... ** \n\nIn 1973, i did study computer sciences, it was the second year of the department, here in Leuven. At the time computers were mainframes and you did fed them with programms by punch cards. Programing was writing down the program, than you punched it and the next day you get results, mostly error. That's the way it worked at that time. To teach us programing, they used the langage of that time, Fortran and some kind of invented assembly langage, it didn't really exist, it was simplified.\n\nMost of the time you did write down your program, the teacher and the assistant would have to tell you what is wrong or good, you didn't had much practical experience.\n\n**How was it like, tons of pages ?** \n\nNo. As an anecdocte, i remember punchcards were a block of papers, we were jealous of the people who came in the computer center with huge stacks of cards. That were really small programs, not complicated one. The fact you had to learn to use the computer from scratch, everything was new, you couldn't rely on previous experiences, everything was new. And to start with small programs was difficult enough. \n\nThat was also the time when Edsger W. Dijkstra who forked the goto... i still remember him, in an audience, giving us a lecture on modernisation in programming at the International computing symposium 1977 in Liège (programming: from craft to scientific discipline https://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/EWD/transcriptions/EWD05xx/EWD566.html). He told usxx (i'll complete it as soon as possible. i need Jean's input)\"\n\nAnd then from 75 on, computers became cheaper and could be bought by departments and smaller entities. And than came the first interactive computer. Still beasts about two cubic meters, costing two millions belgian francs. But it was low enough to allow people to type in directly commands. I started working here in 75 as a researcher, it have evolved continuously and i saw computer getting cheaper and getting easier to use.The way to use it was simplified, you could start to go to the beast and try it out.\n\nI remember more or less: you did write down the program in Fortran for instance… We always thought in the beginning that it would work and it didn't, so after a turn around you were giving it back to the operator and you have to wait half a day or a night to get the results.\n\n**What kind of program you were working on?** \n\nI remember the first program i had to write was you got three numbers, you had to make the program decide if you construct a triangle with the numbers being the sides of the triangle.\n\n**That took an afternoon to be processed ?** \n\nWell, yeah. You had to imagine how to do it which was also one problem, than you prepare the card with the punching machine and you give the package of cards to the operator who was feeeding the computer with the cards. People had the taks to fed the computers by hands, with paper, cards, than disks and it lasts onto the magnetic disks period. And after a number of hours or a night you get a listing, a piece of paper, with the results.\n\n**When where you able to record the program onto the machine?**\n\nI think that happens between 75 and 80. After the punching cards which was already a way to record the program, we had  typewriters, terminals but we could record the programs, we could store them on the computer. We had magnetic discs. IBM had number for everything, i remember the 33-30 [manufactured from 1970 on] had a magnetic disk. We didn't touch the machines, operators would change the disks, we could only access the typewriter. That was our most direct connexion to the computer. Thetimes were diffent. The mainframes were such huge costly beasts that it had operators day and night keeping it busy. Even at night there were two or three guys mounting tapes, dismounting tapes, that kind of stuff.\nhttps://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/42/IBM_magnetic_disk_drives_3330%2B3333.png/600px-IBM_magnetic_disk_drives_3330%2B3333.png\n\n**When did you stop working with operators?** \n\nSomewhere between 85 and 90. There were still operators at the main computer of the university, but there were also small computers, so researchers and student can have direct access when needed. \n\n**When did you start to work with software sold by others or gived away in order to do your research?** \n\nYou stil need an operating system on the mainframe that was delivered by IBM or the constructor delivering the mainframe. When you bought mini-computers, which were the  smaller versions of mainframes, in most cases you did buy an operating systems, compilers and all the stuff you need to be able to program those things. In most cases, because the computer sciences department did buy the mini-computer from, for instance *digital equipment corporation*,  a manufactorer of that time, but they didn't buy their software. They were not open source or free,  but you could get Unix and could run it on those digital equipment (DEC) computers. That is what the computer department of the University of Louvain la Neuve *l'unité d'informatique*, did and so did we.\n\n**When did you start working with unix as an os?** \n\nI took a trip to Amsterdam, it must have been in 1979/80… Well, the story starts in our french sister university (LLN) where they did have a PDP-11 with Unix on it https://hackadaycom.files.wordpress.com/2016/08/full-size-pdp11.jpg. You got Unix, at the time, when you were a university, from Bell Aps (Ma Bell), the american telephone company. It was a mega organisation at the time [before the [dismantlment of AT&T/Bell system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breakup_of_the_Bell_System)].Due to monopoly, the US authorities splitted up in different Baby Bells. One of the restriction was there was a research baby bell, they couldn't really sell anything.There were computer scientists there, who did developped some Unix interesting things.  For universities you did get the source and no support for free. How to install it, no idea. In Unité d'informatique, they were lucky: they got the same computer that unix were developped on.  They got the disk by snail mail as a post-office package. They mounted it and it did spin up and they had it.\nHere, we did have a cheaper PDP11 (DEC - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PDP-11) We go the disk source from Bell Aps but we could not run it. We could look at it but that was all, because our disc format was different than the one at Bell Aps. Somebody here did write a driver for that disk and we did compiled it in l'unité d'informatique of LLN.  it did compile it but we couldn't try it because we did not have So we find the nearest Unix system compatiblewith ours, it was in Amsterdam.  Andrew Tenebaum who did write since then a number of books about operating systems and became quite an authority. He was working there. It was the young Tanenbaum, just arriving from United States to Amsterdam. He was learning to speak dutch. We did understood his english better but his assistant insisted that he speaks dutch because he will have to pass an exam in dutch. There we got a disk, than also the one with the driver we compiled, than we got here and we start using Unix.  Than in my opinion the start of open source was Unix because we had to maintain it by ourselves and we learned a lot from the sources.\nIn that time we did had to get software and it brings us to different places. For example, at the time the agents at the custom at the airport or post didn't know what to do with the discs in terms of custom clearance. They used magnetic or xrays, we had to write on the package that it should not be x-rayed. But we got time to time unreadable discs. \n\n**So it took like weeks between the transportation, the custom...**\nYes, the custom had to clear the packages. I remember i've been in the customs in Zaventem. I had received a letter that my package from Bell Aps had arrived. I went there thinking i would have to pay something and go. But no. It had to be cleared so there wa some organisation that had to do administrative stuff, so i only got it a few days later. The response time was huge :)\n\n**Than after that period of time how did you switch from that kind of collaboration on how to make software and make software work to collaboration on networks, between universities and researchers...**\nIn the Unix system of that time there was a kind of networking protocol which only did work on serial lines.\n You could connect two unix systems together you only need a line. We had one between LLN and Leuven, it's only 15 kms, but we had to ask Belgacom, than La Régie des télégraphes et téléphones, to get a modem to connect through their network and than over that modem you could reach an amazing speed of 300 characters per second. And that was the first communication. It did happened somewhere around 85. And then you had connexion with another computer, writing something here and do  something. And we could send programs to each other. \n \n **What was the first thing you did send through a network like this?**\n I didn't do it myself, i remember it was a kind of chat program. And on LLN side was Eli/Eddy Milgram, he is retired now. n this side it wasPr Willems.\n

__NOPUBLISH__\n\n\n**You have been using computers since a long time, as you explained us during the tour we had the joy of assisting during the TGSO.**\n**I heard that that until recently, let's say the late 1990's, when learning computer programming you had to start by  writing down the program on paper... ** \n\nIn 1973, i did study computer sciences, it was the second year of the department, here in Leuven. At the time computers were mainframes and you did fed them with programms by punch cards. Programing was writing down the program, than you punched it and the next day you get results, mostly error. That's the way it worked at that time. To teach us programing, they used the langage of that time, Fortran and some kind of invented assembly langage, it didn't really exist, it was simplified.\n\nMost of the time you did write down your program, the teacher and the assistant would have to tell you what is wrong or good, you didn't had much practical experience.\n\n**How was it like, tons of pages ?** \n\nNo. As an anecdocte, i remember punchcards were a block of papers, we were jealous of the people who came in the computer center with huge stacks of cards. That were really small programs, not complicated one. The fact you had to learn to use the computer from scratch, everything was new, you couldn't rely on previous experiences, everything was new. And to start with small programs was difficult enough. \n\nThat was also the time when Edsger W. Dijkstra who forked the goto... i still remember him, in an audience, giving us a lecture on modernisation in programming at the International computing symposium 1977 in Liège (programming: from craft to scientific discipline https://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/EWD/transcriptions/EWD05xx/EWD566.html). He told usxx (i'll complete it as soon as possible. i need Jean's input)\"\n\nAnd then from 75 on, computers became cheaper and could be bought by departments and smaller entities. And than came the first interactive computer. Still beasts about two cubic meters, costing two millions belgian francs. But it was low enough to allow people to type in directly commands. I started working here in 75 as a researcher, it have evolved continuously and i saw computer getting cheaper and getting easier to use.The way to use it was simplified, you could start to go to the beast and try it out.\n\nI remember more or less: you did write down the program in Fortran for instance… We always thought in the beginning that it would work and it didn't, so after a turn around you were giving it back to the operator and you have to wait half a day or a night to get the results.\n\n**What kind of program you were working on?** \n\nI remember the first program i had to write was you got three numbers, you had to make the program decide if you construct a triangle with the numbers being the sides of the triangle.\n\n**That took an afternoon to be processed ?** \n\nWell, yeah. You had to imagine how to do it which was also one problem, than you prepare the card with the punching machine and you give the package of cards to the operator who was feeeding the computer with the cards. People had the taks to fed the computers by hands, with paper, cards, than disks and it lasts onto the magnetic disks period. And after a number of hours or a night you get a listing, a piece of paper, with the results.\n\n**When where you able to record the program onto the machine?**\n\nI think that happens between 75 and 80. After the punching cards which was already a way to record the program, we had  typewriters, terminals but we could record the programs, we could store them on the computer. We had magnetic discs. IBM had number for everything, i remember the 33-30 [manufactured from 1970 on] had a magnetic disk. We didn't touch the machines, operators would change the disks, we could only access the typewriter. That was our most direct connexion to the computer. Thetimes were diffent. The mainframes were such huge costly beasts that it had operators day and night keeping it busy. Even at night there were two or three guys mounting tapes, dismounting tapes, that kind of stuff.\nhttps://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/42/IBM_magnetic_disk_drives_3330%2B3333.png/600px-IBM_magnetic_disk_drives_3330%2B3333.png\n\n**When did you stop working with operators?** \n\nSomewhere between 85 and 90. There were still operators at the main computer of the university, but there were also small computers, so researchers and student can have direct access when needed. \n\n**When did you start to work with software sold by others or gived away in order to do your research?** \n\nYou stil need an operating system on the mainframe that was delivered by IBM or the constructor delivering the mainframe. When you bought mini-computers, which were the  smaller versions of mainframes, in most cases you did buy an operating systems, compilers and all the stuff you need to be able to program those things. In most cases, because the computer sciences department did buy the mini-computer from, for instance *digital equipment corporation*,  a manufactorer of that time, but they didn't buy their software. They were not open source or free,  but you could get Unix and could run it on those digital equipment (DEC) computers. That is what the computer department of the University of Louvain la Neuve *l'unité d'informatique*, did and so did we.\n\n**When did you start working with unix as an os?** \n\nI took a trip to Amsterdam, it must have been in 1979/80… Well, the story starts in our french sister university (LLN) where they did have a PDP-11 with Unix on it https://hackadaycom.files.wordpress.com/2016/08/full-size-pdp11.jpg. You got Unix, at the time, when you were a university, from Bell Aps (Ma Bell), the american telephone company. It was a mega organisation at the time [before the [dismantlment of AT&T/Bell system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breakup_of_the_Bell_System)].Due to monopoly, the US authorities splitted up in different Baby Bells. One of the restriction was there was a research baby bell, they couldn't really sell anything.There were computer scientists there, who did developped some Unix interesting things.  For universities you did get the source and no support for free. How to install it, no idea. In Unité d'informatique, they were lucky: they got the same computer that unix were developped on.  They got the disk by snail mail as a post-office package. They mounted it and it did spin up and they had it.\nHere, we did have a cheaper PDP11 (DEC - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PDP-11) We go the disk source from Bell Aps but we could not run it. We could look at it but that was all, because our disc format was different than the one at Bell Aps. Somebody here did write a driver for that disk and we did compiled it in l'unité d'informatique of LLN.  it did compile it but we couldn't try it because we did not have So we find the nearest Unix system compatiblewith ours, it was in Amsterdam.  Andrew Tenebaum who did write since then a number of books about operating systems and became quite an authority. He was working there. It was the young Tanenbaum, just arriving from United States to Amsterdam. He was learning to speak dutch. We did understood his english better but his assistant insisted that he speaks dutch because he will have to pass an exam in dutch. There we got a disk, than also the one with the driver we compiled, than we got here and we start using Unix.  Than in my opinion the start of open source was Unix because we had to maintain it by ourselves and we learned a lot from the sources.\nIn that time we did had to get software and it brings us to different places. For example, at the time the agents at the custom at the airport or post didn't know what to do with the discs in terms of custom clearance. They used magnetic or xrays, we had to write on the package that it should not be x-rayed. But we got time to time unreadable discs. \n\n**So it took like weeks between the transportation, the custom...**\nYes, the custom had to clear the packages. I remember i've been in the customs in Zaventem. I had received a letter that my package from Bell Aps had arrived. I went there thinking i would have to pay something and go. But no. It had to be cleared so there wa some organisation that had to do administrative stuff, so i only got it a few days later. The response time was huge :)\n\n**Than after that period of time how did you switch from that kind of collaboration on how to make software and make software work to collaboration on networks, between universities and researchers...**\nIn the Unix system of that time there was a kind of networking protocol which only did work on serial lines.\n You could connect two unix systems together you only need a line. We had one between LLN and Leuven, it's only 15 kms, but we had to ask Belgacom, than La Régie des télégraphes et téléphones, to get a modem to connect through their network and than over that modem you could reach an amazing speed of 300 characters per second. And that was the first communication. It did happened somewhere around 85. And then you had connexion with another computer, writing something here and do  something. And we could send programs to each other. \n \n **What was the first thing you did send through a network like this?**\n I didn't do it myself, i remember it was a kind of chat program. And on LLN side was Elie Milgrom, he is retired now. On this side, it was Pr Willems. And i remember that they typed something and they got a response from the other side and that was it.  But i remember that Pr Willems sent \"ok we stop now\". And t See you later Alligator.\n

the joy of assisting during the TGSO.**\n**I heard that that until recently, let's say the late 1990's, when learning computer programming you had to start by  writing down the program on paper... ** \n\nIn 1973, i did study computer sciences, it was the second year of the department, here in Leuven. At the time computers were mainframes and you did fed them with programms by punch cards. Programing was writing down the program, than you punched it and the next day you get results, mostly error. That's the way it worked at that time. To teach us programing, they used the langage of that time, Fortran and some kind of invented assembly langage, it didn't really exist, it was simplified.\n\nMost of the time you did write down your program, the teacher and the assistant would have to tell you what is wrong or good, you didn't had much practical experience.\n\n**How was it like, tons of pages ?** \n\nNo. As an anecdocte, i remember punchcards were a block of papers, we were jealous of the people who came in the computer center with huge stacks of cards. That were really small programs, not complicated one. The fact you had to learn to use the computer from scratch, everything was new, you couldn't rely on previous experiences, everything was new. And to start with small programs was difficult enough. \n\nThat was also the time when Edsger W. Dijkstra who forked the goto... i still remember him, in an audience, giving us a lecture on modernisation in programming at the International computing symposium 1977 in Liège (programming: from craft to scientific discipline https://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/EWD/transcriptions/EWD05xx/EWD566.html). He told usxx (i'll complete it as soon as possible. i need Jean's input)\"\n\nAnd then from 75 on, computers became cheaper and could be bought by departments and smaller entities. And than came the first interactive computer. Still beasts about two cubic meters, costing two millions belgian francs. But it was low enough to allow people to type in directly commands. I started working here in 75 as a researcher, it have evolved continuously and i saw computer getting cheaper and getting easier to use.The way to use it was simplified, you could start to go to the beast and try it out.\n\nI remember more or less: you did write down the program in Fortran for instance… We always thought in the beginning that it would work and it didn't, so after a turn around you were giving it back to the operator and you have to wait half a day or a night to get the results.\n\n**What kind of program you were working on?** \n\nI remember the first program i had to write was you got three numbers, you had to make the program decide if you construct a triangle with the numbers being the sides of the triangle.\n\n**That took an afternoon to be processed ?** \n\nWell, yeah. You had to imagine how to do it which was also one problem, than you prepare the card with the punching machine and you give the package of cards to the operator who was feeeding the computer with the cards. People had the taks to fed the computers by hands, with paper, cards, than disks and it lasts onto the magnetic disks period. And after a number of hours or a night you get a listing, a piece of paper, with the results.\n\n**When where you able to record the program onto the machine?**\n\nI think that happens between 75 and 80. After the punching cards which was already a way to record the program, we had  typewriters, terminals but we could record the programs, we could store them on the computer. We had magnetic discs. IBM had number for everything, i remember the 33-30 [manufactured from 1970 on] had a magnetic disk. We didn't touch the machines, operators would change the disks, we could only access the typewriter. That was our most direct connexion to the computer. Thetimes were diffent. The mainframes were such huge costly beasts that it had operators day and night keeping it busy. Even at night there were two or three guys mounting tapes, dismounting tapes, that kind of stuff.\nhttps://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/42/IBM_magnetic_disk_drives_3330%2B3333.png/600px-IBM_magnetic_disk_drives_3330%2B3333.png\n\n**When did you stop working with operators?** \n\nSomewhere between 85 and 90. There were still operators at the main computer of the university, but there were also small computers, so researchers and student can have direct access when needed. \n\n**When did you start to work with software sold by others or gived away in order to do your research?** \n\nYou stil need an operating system on the mainframe that was delivered by IBM or the constructor delivering the mainframe. When you bought mini-computers, which were the  smaller versions of mainframes, in most cases you did buy an operating systems, compilers and all the stuff you need to be able to program those things. In most cases, because the computer sciences department did buy the mini-computer from, for instance *digital equipment corporation*,  a manufactorer of that time, but they didn't buy their software. They were not open source or free,  but you could get Unix and could run it on those digital equipment (DEC) computers. That is what the computer department of the University of Louvain la Neuve *l'unité d'informatique*, did and so did we.\n\n**When did you start working with unix as an os?** \n\nI took a trip to Amsterdam, it must have been in 1979/80… Well, the story starts in our french sister university (LLN) where they did have a PDP-11 with Unix on it https://hackadaycom.files.wordpress.com/2016/08/full-size-pdp11.jpg. You got Unix, at the time, when you were a university, from Bell Aps (Ma Bell), the american telephone company. It was a mega organisation at the time [before the [dismantlment of AT&T/Bell system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breakup_of_the_Bell_System)].Due to monopoly, the US authorities splitted up in different Baby Bells. One of the restriction was there was a research baby bell, they couldn't really sell anything.There were computer scientists there, who did developped some Unix interesting things.  For universities you did get the source and no support for free. How to install it, no idea. In Unité d'informatique, they were lucky: they got the same computer that unix were developped on.  They got the disk by snail mail as a post-office package. They mounted it and it did spin up and they had it.\nHere, we did have a cheaper PDP11 (DEC - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PDP-11) We go the disk source from Bell Aps but we could not run it. We could look at it but that was all, because our disc format was different than the one at Bell Aps. Somebody here did write a driver for that disk and we did compiled it in l'unité d'informatique of LLN.  it did compile it but we couldn't try it because we did not have So we find the nearest Unix system compatiblewith ours, it was in Amsterdam.  Andrew Tenebaum who did write since then a number of books about operating systems and became quite an authority. He was working there. It was the young Tanenbaum, just arriving from United States to Amsterdam. He was learning to speak dutch. We did understood his english better but his assistant insisted that he speaks dutch because he will have to pass an exam in dutch. There we got a disk, than also the one with the driver we compiled, than we got here and we start using Unix.  Than in my opinion the start of open source was Unix because we had to maintain it by ourselves and we learned a lot from the sources.\nIn that time we did had to get software and it brings us to different places. For example, at the time the agents at the custom at the airport or post didn't know what to do with the discs in terms of custom clearance. They used magnetic or xrays, we had to write on the package that it should not be x-rayed. But we got time to time unreadable discs. \n\n**So it took like weeks between the transportation, the custom...**\nYes, the custom had to clear the packages. I remember i've been in the customs in Zaventem. I had received a letter that my package from Bell Aps had arrived. I went there thinking i would have to pay something and go. But no. It had to be cleared so there wa some organisation that had to do administrative stuff, so i only got it a few days later. The response time was huge :)\n\n**Than after that period of time how did you switch from that kind of collaboration on how to make software and make software work to collaboration on networks, between universities and researchers...**\nIn the Unix system of that time there was a kind of networking protocol which only did work on serial lines.\n You could connect two unix systems together you only need a line. We had one between LLN and Leuven, it's only 15 kms, but we had to ask Belgacom, than La Régie des télégraphes et téléphones, to get a modem to connect through their network and than over that modem you could reach an amazing speed of 300 characters per second. And that was the first communication. It did happened somewhere around 85. And then you had connexion with another computer, writing something here and do  something. And we could send programs to each other. \n \n **What was the first thing you did send through a network like this?**\n I didn't do it myself, i remember it was a kind of chat program. And on LLN side was Elie Milgrom, he is retired now. On this side, it was Pr Willems. And i remember that they typed something and they got a response from the other side and that was it.  But i remember that Pr Willems sent \"ok we stop now\". And that Elie Milgrom answered \"See you later, Alligator\"[a reference to Bill Haley and the Comets].  At the time we still had these kind of songs in mind. (lol).

the joy of assisting during the TGSO.**\n**I heard that that until recently, let's say the late 1990's, when learning computer programming you had to start by  writing down the program on paper... ** \n\nIn 1973, i did study computer sciences, it was the second year of the department, here in Leuven. At the time computers were mainframes and you did fed them with programms by punch cards. Programing was writing down the program, than you punched it and the next day you get results, mostly error. That's the way it worked at that time. To teach us programing, they used the langage of that time, Fortran and some kind of invented assembly langage, it didn't really exist, it was simplified.\n\nMost of the time you did write down your program, the teacher and the assistant would have to tell you what is wrong or good, you didn't had much practical experience.\n\n**How was it like, tons of pages ?** \n\nNo. As an anecdocte, i remember punchcards were a block of papers, we were jealous of the people who came in the computer center with huge stacks of cards. That were really small programs, not complicated one. The fact you had to learn to use the computer from scratch, everything was new, you couldn't rely on previous experiences, everything was new. And to start with small programs was difficult enough. \n\nThat was also the time when Edsger W. Dijkstra who forked the goto... i still remember him, in an audience, giving us a lecture on modernisation in programming at the International computing symposium 1977 in Liège (programming: from craft to scientific discipline https://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/EWD/transcriptions/EWD05xx/EWD566.html). He told usxx (i'll complete it as soon as possible. i need Jean's input)\"\n\nAnd then from 75 on, computers became cheaper and could be bought by departments and smaller entities. And than came the first interactive computer. Still beasts about two cubic meters, costing two millions belgian francs. But it was low enough to allow people to type in directly commands. I started working here in 75 as a researcher, it have evolved continuously and i saw computer getting cheaper and getting easier to use.The way to use it was simplified, you could start to go to the beast and try it out.\n\nI remember more or less: you did write down the program in Fortran for instance… We always thought in the beginning that it would work and it didn't, so after a turn around you were giving it back to the operator and you have to wait half a day or a night to get the results.\n\n**What kind of program you were working on?** \n\nI remember the first program i had to write was you got three numbers, you had to make the program decide if you construct a triangle with the numbers being the sides of the triangle.\n\n**That took an afternoon to be processed ?** \n\nWell, yeah. You had to imagine how to do it which was also one problem, than you prepare the card with the punching machine and you give the package of cards to the operator who was feeeding the computer with the cards. People had the taks to fed the computers by hands, with paper, cards, than disks and it lasts onto the magnetic disks period. And after a number of hours or a night you get a listing, a piece of paper, with the results.\n\n**When where you able to record the program onto the machine?**\n\nI think that happens between 75 and 80. After the punching cards which was already a way to record the program, we had  typewriters, terminals but we could record the programs, we could store them on the computer. We had magnetic discs. IBM had number for everything, i remember the 33-30 [manufactured from 1970 on] had a magnetic disk. We didn't touch the machines, operators would change the disks, we could only access the typewriter. That was our most direct connexion to the computer. Thetimes were diffent. The mainframes were such huge costly beasts that it had operators day and night keeping it busy. Even at night there were two or three guys mounting tapes, dismounting tapes, that kind of stuff.\nhttps://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/42/IBM_magnetic_disk_drives_3330%2B3333.png/600px-IBM_magnetic_disk_drives_3330%2B3333.png\n\n**When did you stop working with operators?** \n\nSomewhere between 85 and 90. There were still operators at the main computer of the university, but there were also small computers, so researchers and student can have direct access when needed. \n\n**When did you start to work with software sold by others or gived away in order to do your research?** \n\nYou stil need an operating system on the mainframe that was delivered by IBM or the constructor delivering the mainframe. When you bought mini-computers, which were the  smaller versions of mainframes, in most cases you did buy an operating systems, compilers and all the stuff you need to be able to program those things. In most cases, because the computer sciences department did buy the mini-computer from, for instance *digital equipment corporation*,  a manufactorer of that time, but they didn't buy their software. They were not open source or free,  but you could get Unix and could run it on those digital equipment (DEC) computers. That is what the computer department of the University of Louvain la Neuve *l'unité d'informatique*, did and so did we.\n\n**When did you start working with unix as an os?** \n\nI took a trip to Amsterdam, it must have been in 1979/80… Well, the story starts in our french sister university (LLN) where they did have a PDP-11 with Unix on it https://hackadaycom.files.wordpress.com/2016/08/full-size-pdp11.jpg. You got Unix, at the time, when you were a university, from Bell Aps (Ma Bell), the american telephone company. It was a mega organisation at the time [before the [dismantlment of AT&T/Bell system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breakup_of_the_Bell_System)].Due to monopoly, the US authorities splitted up in different Baby Bells. One of the restriction was there was a research baby bell, they couldn't really sell anything.There were computer scientists there, who did developped some Unix interesting things.  For universities you did get the source and no support for free. How to install it, no idea. In Unité d'informatique, they were lucky: they got the same computer that unix were developped on.  They got the disk by snail mail as a post-office package. They mounted it and it did spin up and they had it.\nHere, we did have a cheaper PDP11 (DEC - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PDP-11) We go the disk source from Bell Aps but we could not run it. We could look at it but that was all, because our disc format was different than the one at Bell Aps. Somebody here did write a driver for that disk and we did compiled it in l'unité d'informatique of LLN.  it did compile it but we couldn't try it because we did not have So we find the nearest Unix system compatiblewith ours, it was in Amsterdam.  Andrew Tenebaum who did write since then a number of books about operating systems and became quite an authority. He was working there. It was the young Tanenbaum, just arriving from United States to Amsterdam. He was learning to speak dutch. We did understood his english better but his assistant insisted that he speaks dutch because he will have to pass an exam in dutch. There we got a disk, than also the one with the driver we compiled, than we got here and we start using Unix.  Than in my opinion the start of open source was Unix because we had to maintain it by ourselves and we learned a lot from the sources.\nIn that time we did had to get software and it brings us to different places. For example, at the time the agents at the custom at the airport or post didn't know what to do with the discs in terms of custom clearance. They used magnetic or xrays, we had to write on the package that it should not be x-rayed. But we got time to time unreadable discs. \n\n**So it took like weeks between the transportation, the custom...**\nYes, the custom had to clear the packages. I remember i've been in the customs in Zaventem. I had received a letter that my package from Bell Aps had arrived. I went there thinking i would have to pay something and go. But no. It had to be cleared so there wa some organisation that had to do administrative stuff, so i only got it a few days later. The response time was huge :)\n\n**Than after that period of time how did you switch from that kind of collaboration on how to make software and make software work to collaboration on networks, between universities and researchers...**\nIn the Unix system of that time there was a kind of networking protocol which only did work on serial lines.\n You could connect two unix systems together you only need a line. We had one between LLN and Leuven, it's only 15 kms, but we had to ask Belgacom, than La Régie des télégraphes et téléphones, to get a modem to connect through their network and than over that modem you could reach an amazing speed of 300 characters per second. And that was the first communication. It did happened somewhere around 85. And then you had connexion with another computer, writing something here and do  something. And we could send programs to each other. \n \n **What was the first thing you did send through a network like this?**\n I didn't do it myself, i remember it was a kind of chat program. And on LLN side was Elie Milgrom, he is retired now. On this side, it was Pr Willems. And i remember that they typed something and they got a response from the other side and that was it.  But i remember that Pr Willems sent \"ok we stop now\". And that Elie Milgrom answered \"See you later, Alligator\" [a reference to Bill Haley and the Comets].  At the time we still had these kind of songs in mind. (lol). Those Unix to Unix connexions were first. And there was a worldwide Unix to Unix based network, Usenet, it still exists somewhere y\n download of illegal movies was not what we meant at the time.\n

And to start with small programms was difficult enough. \n\nThat was also the time when the guy who forked the goto (Edsger W.

At the time computers were mainframes and you did fed them with programms by punch cards. Programing was writing down the program, than you punched it and the next day you get results, mostly error. That's the way it worked at that time. To teach us programing, they used the langage of that time, Fortran and some kind of invented assembly langage, it didn't really exist, it was simplified.\n\nMost of the time you did write down your program, the teacher and the assistant would have to tell you what is wrong or good, you didn't had much practical experience.\n\n**How was it like, tons of pages ?** \n\nNo. As an anecdocte, i remember punchcards were a block of papers, we were jealous of the people who came in the computer center with huge stacks of cards. That were really small programs, not complicated one. The fact you had to learn to use the computer from scratch, everything was new, you couldn't rely on previous experiences, everything was new. And to start with small programs was difficult enough. \n\nThat was also the time when Edsger W. Dijkstra who forked the goto... i still remember him, in an audience, giving us a lecture on modernisation in programming at the International computing symposium 1977 in Liège (programming: from craft to scientific discipline https://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/EWD/transcriptions/EWD05xx/EWD566.html). He told usxx (i'll complete it as soon as possible. i need Jean's input)\"\n\nAnd then from 75 on, computers became cheaper and could be bought by departments and smaller entities. And than came the first interactive computer. Still beasts about two cubic meters, costing two millions belgian francs. But it was low enough to allow people to type in directly commands. I started working here in 75 as a researcher, it have evolved continuously and i saw computer getting cheaper and getting easier to use.The way to use it was simplified, you could start to go to the beast and try it out.\n\nI remember more or less: you did write down the program in Fortran for instance… We always thought in the beginning that it would work and it didn't, so after a turn around you were giving it back to the operator and you have to wait half a day or a night to get the results.\n\n**What kind of program you were working on?** \n\nI remember the first program i had to write was you got three numbers, you had to make the program decide if you construct a triangle with the numbers being the sides of the triangle.\n\n**That took an afternoon to be processed ?** \n\nWell, yeah. You had to imagine how to do it which was also one problem, than you prepare the card with the punching machine and you give the package of cards to the operator who was feeeding the computer with the cards. People had the taks to fed the computers by hands, with paper, cards, than disks and it lasts onto the magnetic disks period. And after a number of hours or a night you get a listing, a piece of paper, with the results.\n\n**When where you able to record the program onto the machine?**\n\nI think that happens between 75 and 80. After the punching cards which was already a way to record the program, we had  typewriters, terminals but we could record the programs, we could store them on the computer. We had magnetic discs. IBM had number for everything, i remember the 33-30 [manufactured from 1970 on] had a magnetic disk. We didn't touch the machines, operators would change the disks, we could only access the typewriter. That was our most direct connexion to the computer. Thetimes were diffent. The mainframes were such huge costly beasts that it had operators day and night keeping it busy. Even at night there were two or three guys mounting tapes, dismounting tapes, that kind of stuff.\nhttps://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/42/IBM_magnetic_disk_drives_3330%2B3333.png/600px-IBM_magnetic_disk_drives_3330%2B3333.png\n\n**When did you stop working with operators?** \n\nSomewhere between 85 and 90. There were still operators at the main computer of the university, but there were also small computers, so researchers and student can have direct access when needed. \n\n**When did you start to work with software sold by others or gived away in order to do your research?** \n\nYou stil need an operating system on the mainframe that was delivered by IBM or the constructor delivering the mainframe. When you bought mini-computers, which were the  smaller versions of mainframes, in most cases you did buy an operating systems, compilers and all the stuff you need to be able to program those things. In most cases, because the computer sciences department did buy the mini-computer from, for instance *digital equipment corporation*,  a manufactorer of that time, but they didn't buy their software. They were not open source or free,  but you could get Unix and could run it on those digital equipment (DEC) computers. That is what the computer department of the University of Louvain la Neuve *l'unité d'informatique*, did and so did we.\n\n**When did you start working with unix as an os?** \n\nI took a trip to Amsterdam, it must have been in 1979/80… Well, the story starts in our french sister university (LLN) where they did have a PDP-11 with Unix on it https://hackadaycom.files.wordpress.com/2016/08/full-size-pdp11.jpg. You got Unix, at the time, when you were a university, from Bell Aps (Ma Bell), the american telephone company. It was a mega organisation at the time [before the [dismantlment of AT&T/Bell system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breakup_of_the_Bell_System)].Due to monopoly, the US authorities splitted up in different Baby Bells. One of the restriction was there was a research baby bell, they couldn't really sell anything.There were computer scientists there, who did developped some Unix interesting things.  For universities you did get the source and no support for free. How to install it, no idea. In Unité d'informatique, they were lucky: they got the same computer that unix were developped on.  They got the disk by snail mail as a post-office package. They mounted it and it did spin up and they had it.\nHere, we did have a cheaper PDP11 (DEC - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PDP-11) We go the disk source from Bell Aps but we could not run it. We could look at it but that was all, because our disc format was different than the one at Bell Aps. Somebody here did write a driver for that disk and we did compiled it in l'unité d'informatique of LLN.  it did compile it but we couldn't try it because we did not have So we find the nearest Unix system compatiblewith ours, it was in Amsterdam.  Andrew Tenebaum who did write since then a number of books about operating systems and became quite an authority. He was working there. It was the young Tanenbaum, just arriving from United States to Amsterdam. He was learning to speak dutch. We did understood his english better but his assistant insisted that he speaks dutch because he will have to pass an exam in dutch. There we got a disk, than also the one with the driver we compiled, than we got here and we start using Unix.  Than in my opinion the start of open source was Unix because we had to maintain it by ourselves and we learned a lot from the sources.\nIn that time we did had to get software and it brings us to different places. For example, at the time the agents at the custom at the airport or post didn't know what to do with the discs in terms of custom clearance. They used magnetic or xrays, we had to write on the package that it should not be x-rayed. But we got time to time unreadable discs. \n\n**So it took like weeks between the transportation, the custom...**\nYes, the custom had to clear the packages. I remember i've been in the customs in Zaventem. I had received a letter that my package from Bell Aps had arrived. I went there thinking i would have to pay something and go. But no. It had to be cleared so there wa some organisation that had to do administrative stuff, so i only got it a few days later. The response time was huge :)\n\n**Than after that period of time how did you switch from that kind of collaboration on how to make software and make software work to collaboration on networks, between universities and researchers...**\nIn the Unix system of that time there was a kind of networking protocol which only did work on serial lines.\n You could connect two unix systems together you only need a line. We had one between LLN and Leuven, it's only 15 kms, but we had to ask Belgacom, than La Régie des télégraphes et téléphones, to get a modem to connect through their network and than over that modem you could reach an amazing speed of 300 characters per second. And that was the first communication. It did happened somewhere around 85. And then you had connexion with another computer, writing something here and do  something. And we could send programs to each other. \n \n **What was the first thing you did send through a network like this?**\n I didn't do it myself, i remember it was a kind of chat program. And on LLN side was Elie Milgrom, he is retired now. On this side, it was Pr Willems. And i remember that they typed something and they got a response from the other side and that was it.  But i remember that Pr Willems sent \"ok we stop now\". And that Elie Milgrom answered \"See you later, Alligator\" [a reference to Bill Haley and the Comets].  At the time we still had these kind of songs in mind. (lol). Those Unix to Unix connexions were first. And there was a worldwide Unix to Unix based network, Usenet (1979), it still exists somewhere... you can download load  of illegal movies, that was not what we meant at the time. That is what is left. And Usenet became gradually replaced by the Internet in USA. In Europe, the Internet \n

the joy of assisting during the TGSO.**\n**I heard that that until recently, let's say the late 1990's, when learning computer programming you had to start by  writing down the program on paper... ** \n\nIn 1973, i did study computer sciences, it was the second year of the department, here in Leuven. At the time computers were mainframes and you did fed them with programms by punch cards. Programing was writing down the program, than you punched it and the next day you get results, mostly error. That's the way it worked at that time. To teach us programing, they used the langage of that time, Fortran and some kind of invented assembly langage, it didn't really exist, it was simplified.\n\nMost of the time you did write down your program, the teacher and the assistant would have to tell you what is wrong or good, you didn't had much practical experience.\n\n**How was it like, tons of pages ?** \n\nNo. As an anecdocte, i remember punchcards were a block of papers, we were jealous of the people who came in the computer center with huge stacks of cards. That were really small programs, not complicated one. The fact you had to learn to use the computer from scratch, everything was new, you couldn't rely on previous experiences, everything was new. And to start with small programs was difficult enough. \n\nThat was also the time when Edsger W. Dijkstra who forked the goto... i still remember him, in an audience, giving us a lecture on modernisation in programming at the International computing symposium 1977 in Liège (programming: from craft to scientific discipline https://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/EWD/transcriptions/EWD05xx/EWD566.html). He told usxx (i'll complete it as soon as possible. i need Jean's input)\"\n\nAnd then from 75 on, computers became cheaper and could be bought by departments and smaller entities. And than came the first interactive computer. Still beasts about two cubic meters, costing two millions belgian francs. But it was low enough to allow people to type in directly commands. I started working here in 75 as a researcher, it have evolved continuously and i saw computer getting cheaper and getting easier to use.The way to use it was simplified, you could start to go to the beast and try it out.\n\nI remember more or less: you did write down the program in Fortran for instance… We always thought in the beginning that it would work and it didn't, so after a turn around you were giving it back to the operator and you have to wait half a day or a night to get the results.\n\n**What kind of program you were working on?** \n\nI remember the first program i had to write was you got three numbers, you had to make the program decide if you construct a triangle with the numbers being the sides of the triangle.\n\n**That took an afternoon to be processed ?** \n\nWell, yeah. You had to imagine how to do it which was also one problem, than you prepare the card with the punching machine and you give the package of cards to the operator who was feeeding the computer with the cards. People had the taks to fed the computers by hands, with paper, cards, than disks and it lasts onto the magnetic disks period. And after a number of hours or a night you get a listing, a piece of paper, with the results.\n\n**When where you able to record the program onto the machine?**\n\nI think that happens between 75 and 80. After the punching cards which was already a way to record the program, we had  typewriters, terminals but we could record the programs, we could store them on the computer. We had magnetic discs. IBM had number for everything, i remember the 33-30 [manufactured from 1970 on] had a magnetic disk. We didn't touch the machines, operators would change the disks, we could only access the typewriter. That was our most direct connexion to the computer. Thetimes were diffent. The mainframes were such huge costly beasts that it had operators day and night keeping it busy. Even at night there were two or three guys mounting tapes, dismounting tapes, that kind of stuff.\nhttps://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/42/IBM_magnetic_disk_drives_3330%2B3333.png/600px-IBM_magnetic_disk_drives_3330%2B3333.png\n\n**When did you stop working with operators?** \n\nSomewhere between 85 and 90. There were still operators at the main computer of the university, but there were also small computers, so researchers and student can have direct access when needed. \n\n**When did you start to work with software sold by others or gived away in order to do your research?** \n\nYou stil need an operating system on the mainframe that was delivered by IBM or the constructor delivering the mainframe. When you bought mini-computers, which were the  smaller versions of mainframes, in most cases you did buy an operating systems, compilers and all the stuff you need to be able to program those things. In most cases, because the computer sciences department did buy the mini-computer from, for instance *digital equipment corporation*,  a manufactorer of that time, but they didn't buy their software. They were not open source or free,  but you could get Unix and could run it on those digital equipment (DEC) computers. That is what the computer department of the University of Louvain la Neuve *l'unité d'informatique*, did and so did we.\n\n**When did you start working with unix as an os?** \n\nI took a trip to Amsterdam, it must have been in 1979/80… Well, the story starts in our french sister university (LLN) where they did have a PDP-11 with Unix on it https://hackadaycom.files.wordpress.com/2016/08/full-size-pdp11.jpg. You got Unix, at the time, when you were a university, from Bell Aps (Ma Bell), the american telephone company. It was a mega organisation at the time [before the [dismantlment of AT&T/Bell system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breakup_of_the_Bell_System)].Due to monopoly, the US authorities splitted up in different Baby Bells. One of the restriction was there was a research baby bell, they couldn't really sell anything.There were computer scientists there, who did developped some Unix interesting things.  For universities you did get the source and no support for free. How to install it, no idea. In Unité d'informatique, they were lucky: they got the same computer that unix were developped on.  They got the disk by snail mail as a post-office package. They mounted it and it did spin up and they had it.\nHere, we did have a cheaper PDP11 (DEC - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PDP-11) We go the disk source from Bell Aps but we could not run it. We could look at it but that was all, because our disc format was different than the one at Bell Aps. Somebody here did write a driver for that disk and we did compiled it in l'unité d'informatique of LLN.  it did compile it but we couldn't try it because we did not have So we find the nearest Unix system compatiblewith ours, it was in Amsterdam.  Andrew Tenebaum who did write since then a number of books about operating systems and became quite an authority. He was working there. It was the young Tanenbaum, just arriving from United States to Amsterdam. He was learning to speak dutch. We did understood his english better but his assistant insisted that he speaks dutch because he will have to pass an exam in dutch. There we got a disk, than also the one with the driver we compiled, than we got here and we start using Unix.  Than in my opinion the start of open source was Unix because we had to maintain it by ourselves and we learned a lot from the sources.\nIn that time we did had to get software and it brings us to different places. For example, at the time the agents at the custom at the airport or post didn't know what to do with the discs in terms of custom clearance. They used magnetic or xrays, we had to write on the package that it should not be x-rayed. But we got time to time unreadable discs. \n\n**So it took like weeks between the transportation, the custom...**\nYes, the custom had to clear the packages. I remember i've been in the customs in Zaventem. I had received a letter that my package from Bell Aps had arrived. I went there thinking i would have to pay something and go. But no. It had to be cleared so there wa some organisation that had to do administrative stuff, so i only got it a few days later. The response time was huge :)\n\n**Than after that period of time how did you switch from that kind of collaboration on how to make software and make software work to collaboration on networks, between universities and researchers...**\nIn the Unix system of that time there was a kind of networking protocol which only did work on serial lines.\n You could connect two unix systems together you only need a line. We had one between LLN and Leuven, it's only 15 kms, but we had to ask Belgacom, than La Régie des télégraphes et téléphones, to get a modem to connect through their network and than over that modem you could reach an amazing speed of 300 characters per second. And that was the first communication. It did happened somewhere around 85. And then you had connexion with another computer, writing something here and do  something. And we could send programs to each other. \n \n **What was the first thing you did send through a network like this?**\n I didn't do it myself, i remember it was a kind of chat program. And on LLN side was Elie Milgrom, he is retired now. On this side, it was Pr Willems. And i remember that they typed something and they got a response from the other side and that was it.  But i remember that Pr Willems sent \"ok we stop now\". And that Elie Milgrom answered \"See you later, Alligator\" [a reference to Bill Haley and the Comets].  At the time we still had these kind of songs in mind. (lol). Those Unix to Unix connexions were first. And there was a worldwide Unix to Unix based network, Usenet (1979), it still exists somewhere... you can download load  of illegal movies and that stuff, that was not what we meant at the time. That is what is left. And Usenet became gradually replaced by the Internet in USA.

__NOPUBLISH__\n\n\n**You have been using computers since a long time, as you explained us during the tour we had the joy of assisting during the TGSO.**\n**I heard that that until recently, let's say the late 1990's, when learning computer programming you had to start by  writing down the program on paper... ** \n\nIn 1973, i did study computer sciences, it was the second year of the department, here in Leuven. At the time computers were mainframes and you did fed them with programms by punch cards. Programing was writing down the program, than you punched it and the next day you get results, mostly error. That's the way it worked at that time. To teach us programing, they used the langage of that time, Fortran and some kind of invented assembly langage, it didn't really exist, it was simplified.\n\nMost of the time you did write down your program, the teacher and the assistant would have to tell you what is wrong or good, you didn't had much practical experience.\n\n**How was it like, tons of pages ?** \n\nNo. As an anecdocte, i remember punchcards were a block of papers, we were jealous of the people who came in the computer center with huge stacks of cards. That were really small programs, not complicated one. The fact you had to learn to use the computer from scratch, everything was new, you couldn't rely on previous experiences, everything was new. And to start with small programs was difficult enough. \n\nThat was also the time when Edsger W. Dijkstra who forked the goto... i still remember him, in an audience, giving us a lecture on modernisation in programming at the International computing symposium 1977 in Liège (programming: from craft to scientific discipline https://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/EWD/transcriptions/EWD05xx/EWD566.html). He told usxx (i'll complete it as soon as possible. i need Jean's input)\"\n\nAnd then from 75 on, computers became cheaper and could be bought by departments and smaller entities. And than came the first interactive computer. Still beasts about two cubic meters, costing two millions belgian francs. But it was low enough to allow people to type in directly commands. I started working here in 75 as a researcher, it have evolved continuously and i saw computer getting cheaper and getting easier to use.The way to use it was simplified, you could start to go to the beast and try it out.\n\nI remember more or less: you did write down the program in Fortran for instance… We always thought in the beginning that it would work and it didn't, so after a turn around you were giving it back to the operator and you have to wait half a day or a night to get the results.\n\n**What kind of program you were working on?** \n\nI remember the first program i had to write was you got three numbers, you had to make the program decide if you construct a triangle with the numbers being the sides of the triangle.\n\n**That took an afternoon to be processed ?** \n\nWell, yeah. You had to imagine how to do it which was also one problem, than you prepare the card with the punching machine and you give the package of cards to the operator who was feeeding the computer with the cards. People had the taks to fed the computers by hands, with paper, cards, than disks and it lasts onto the magnetic disks period. And after a number of hours or a night you get a listing, a piece of paper, with the results.\n\n**When where you able to record the program onto the machine?**\n\nI think that happens between 75 and 80. After the punching cards which was already a way to record the program, we had  typewriters, terminals but we could record the programs, we could store them on the computer. We had magnetic discs. IBM had number for everything, i remember the 33-30 [manufactured from 1970 on] had a magnetic disk. We didn't touch the machines, operators would change the disks, we could only access the typewriter. That was our most direct connexion to the computer. Thetimes were diffent. The mainframes were such huge costly beasts that it had operators day and night keeping it busy. Even at night there were two or three guys mounting tapes, dismounting tapes, that kind of stuff.\nhttps://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/42/IBM_magnetic_disk_drives_3330%2B3333.png/600px-IBM_magnetic_disk_drives_3330%2B3333.png\n\n**When did you stop working with operators?** \n\nSomewhere between 85 and 90. There were still operators at the main computer of the university, but there were also small computers, so researchers and student can have direct access when needed. \n\n**When did you start to work with software sold by others or gived away in order to do your research?** \n\nYou stil need an operating system on the mainframe that was delivered by IBM or the constructor delivering the mainframe. When you bought mini-computers, which were the  smaller versions of mainframes, in most cases you did buy an operating systems, compilers and all the stuff you need to be able to program those things. In most cases, because the computer sciences department did buy the mini-computer from, for instance *digital equipment corporation*,  a manufactorer of that time, but they didn't buy their software. They were not open source or free,  but you could get Unix and could run it on those digital equipment (DEC) computers. That is what the computer department of the University of Louvain la Neuve *l'unité d'informatique*, did and so did we.\n\n**When did you start working with unix as an os?** \n\nI took a trip to Amsterdam, it must have been in 1979/80… Well, the story starts in our french sister university (LLN) where they did have a PDP-11 with Unix on it https://hackadaycom.files.wordpress.com/2016/08/full-size-pdp11.jpg. You got Unix, at the time, when you were a university, from Bell Aps (Ma Bell), the american telephone company. It was a mega organisation at the time [before the [dismantlment of AT&T/Bell system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breakup_of_the_Bell_System)].Due to monopoly, the US authorities splitted up in different Baby Bells. One of the restriction was there was a research baby bell, they couldn't really sell anything.There were computer scientists there, who did developped some Unix interesting things.  For universities you did get the source and no support for free. How to install it, no idea. In Unité d'informatique, they were lucky: they got the same computer that unix were developped on.  They got the disk by snail mail as a post-office package. They mounted it and it did spin up and they had it.\nHere, we did have a cheaper PDP11 (DEC - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PDP-11) We go the disk source from Bell Aps but we could not run it. We could look at it but that was all, because our disc format was different than the one at Bell Aps. Somebody here did write a driver for that disk and we did compiled it in l'unité d'informatique of LLN.  it did compile it but we couldn't try it because we did not have So we find the nearest Unix system compatiblewith ours, it was in Amsterdam.  Andrew Tenebaum who did write since then a number of books about operating systems and became quite an authority. He was working there. It was the young Tanenbaum, just arriving from United States to Amsterdam. He was learning to speak dutch. We did understood his english better but his assistant insisted that he speaks dutch because he will have to pass an exam in dutch. There we got a disk, than also the one with the driver we compiled, than we got here and we start using Unix.  Than in my opinion the start of open source was Unix because we had to maintain it by ourselves and we learned a lot from the sources.\nIn that time we did had to get software and it brings us to different places. For example, at the time the agents at the custom at the airport or post didn't know what to do with the discs in terms of custom clearance. They used magnetic or xrays, we had to write on the package that it should not be x-rayed. But we got time to time unreadable discs. \n\n**So it took like weeks between the transportation, the custom...**\nYes, the custom had to clear the packages. I remember i've been in the customs in Zaventem. I had received a letter that my package from Bell Aps had arrived. I went there thinking i would have to pay something and go. But no. It had to be cleared so there wa some organisation that had to do administrative stuff, so i only got it a few days later. The response time was huge :)\n\n**Than after that period of time how did you switch from that kind of collaboration on how to make software and make software work to collaboration on networks, between universities and researchers...**\nIn the Unix system of that time there was a kind of networking protocol which only did work on serial lines.\n You could connect two unix systems together you only need a line. We had one between LLN and Leuven, it's only 15 kms, but we had to ask Belgacom, than La Régie des télégraphes et téléphones, to get a modem to connect through their network and than over that modem you could reach an amazing speed of 300 characters per second. And that was the first communication. It did happened somewhere around 85. And then you had connexion with another computer, writing something here and do  something. And we could send programs to each other. \n \n **What was the first thing you did send through a network like this?**\n I didn't do it myself, i remember it was a kind of chat program. And on LLN side was Elie Milgrom, he is retired now. On this side, it was Pr Willems. And i remember that they typed something and they got a response from the other side and that was it.  But i remember that Pr Willems sent \"ok we stop now\". And that Elie Milgrom answered \"See you later, Alligator\" [a reference to Bill Haley and the Comets].  At the time we still had these kind of songs in mind. (lol). Those Unix to Unix connexions were first. And there was a worldwide Unix to Unix based network, Usenet (1979), it still exists somewhere... you can download load  of illegal movies and that stuff, that was not what we meant at the time. But that is what is left. And Usenet became gradually replaced by the Internet in USA. In Europe, the Internet came a lot later, but we had access to the Internet, we could send mail to them and we could receive mail from them, because some friendly american university, later companies, did translate internet mail to UCP mail. That was before the 1990's.\n \n Your relation to software had changed at the time because you did not have to do all this manipulation with the sof\n

At the time computers were mainframes and you did fed them with programms by punch cards. Programing was writing down the program, than you punched it and the next day you get results, mostly error. That's the way it worked at that time. To teach us programing, they used the langage of that time, Fortran and some kind of invented assembly langage, it didn't really exist, it was simplified.\n\nMost of the time you did write down your program, the teacher and the assistant would have to tell you what is wrong or good, you didn't had much practical experience.\n\n**How was it like, tons of pages ?** \n\nNo. As an anecdocte, i remember punchcards were a block of papers, we were jealous of the people who came in the computer center with huge stacks of cards. That were really small programs, not complicated one. The fact you had to learn to use the computer from scratch, everything was new, you couldn't rely on previous experiences, everything was new. And to start with small programs was difficult enough. \n\nThat was also the time when Edsger W. Dijkstra who forked the goto... i still remember him, in an audience, giving us a lecture on modernisation in programming at the International computing symposium 1977 in Liège (programming: from craft to scientific discipline https://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/EWD/transcriptions/EWD05xx/EWD566.html). He told usxx (i'll complete it as soon as possible. i need Jean's input)\"\n\nAnd then from 75 on, computers became cheaper and could be bought by departments and smaller entities. And than came the first interactive computer. Still beasts about two cubic meters, costing two millions belgian francs. But it was low enough to allow people to type in directly commands. I started working here in 75 as a researcher, it have evolved continuously and i saw computer getting cheaper and getting easier to use.The way to use it was simplified, you could start to go to the beast and try it out.\n\nI remember more or less: you did write down the program in Fortran for instance… We always thought in the beginning that it would work and it didn't, so after a turn around you were giving it back to the operator and you have to wait half a day or a night to get the results.\n\n**What kind of program you were working on?** \n\nI remember the first program i had to write was you got three numbers, you had to make the program decide if you construct a triangle with the numbers being the sides of the triangle.\n\n**That took an afternoon to be processed ?** \n\nWell, yeah. You had to imagine how to do it which was also one problem, than you prepare the card with the punching machine and you give the package of cards to the operator who was feeeding the computer with the cards. People had the taks to fed the computers by hands, with paper, cards, than disks and it lasts onto the magnetic disks period. And after a number of hours or a night you get a listing, a piece of paper, with the results.\n\n**When where you able to record the program onto the machine?**\n\nI think that happens between 75 and 80. After the punching cards which was already a way to record the program, we had  typewriters, terminals but we could record the programs, we could store them on the computer. We had magnetic discs. IBM had number for everything, i remember the 33-30 [manufactured from 1970 on] had a magnetic disk. We didn't touch the machines, operators would change the disks, we could only access the typewriter. That was our most direct connexion to the computer. Thetimes were diffent. The mainframes were such huge costly beasts that it had operators day and night keeping it busy. Even at night there were two or three guys mounting tapes, dismounting tapes, that kind of stuff.\nhttps://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/42/IBM_magnetic_disk_drives_3330%2B3333.png/600px-IBM_magnetic_disk_drives_3330%2B3333.png\n\n**When did you stop working with operators?** \n\nSomewhere between 85 and 90. There were still operators at the main computer of the university, but there were also small computers, so researchers and student can have direct access when needed. \n\n**When did you start to work with software sold by others or gived away in order to do your research?** \n\nYou stil need an operating system on the mainframe that was delivered by IBM or the constructor delivering the mainframe. When you bought mini-computers, which were the  smaller versions of mainframes, in most cases you did buy an operating systems, compilers and all the stuff you need to be able to program those things. In most cases, because the computer sciences department did buy the mini-computer from, for instance *digital equipment corporation*,  a manufactorer of that time, but they didn't buy their software. They were not open source or free,  but you could get Unix and could run it on those digital equipment (DEC) computers. That is what the computer department of the University of Louvain la Neuve *l'unité d'informatique*, did and so did we.\n\n**When did you start working with unix as an os?** \n\nI took a trip to Amsterdam, it must have been in 1979/80… Well, the story starts in our french sister university (LLN) where they did have a PDP-11 with Unix on it https://hackadaycom.files.wordpress.com/2016/08/full-size-pdp11.jpg. You got Unix, at the time, when you were a university, from Bell Aps (Ma Bell), the american telephone company. It was a mega organisation at the time [before the [dismantlment of AT&T/Bell system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breakup_of_the_Bell_System)].Due to monopoly, the US authorities splitted up in different Baby Bells. One of the restriction was there was a research baby bell, they couldn't really sell anything.There were computer scientists there, who did developped some Unix interesting things.  For universities you did get the source and no support for free. How to install it, no idea. In Unité d'informatique, they were lucky: they got the same computer that unix were developped on.  They got the disk by snail mail as a post-office package. They mounted it and it did spin up and they had it.\nHere, we did have a cheaper PDP11 (DEC - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PDP-11) We go the disk source from Bell Aps but we could not run it. We could look at it but that was all, because our disc format was different than the one at Bell Aps. Somebody here did write a driver for that disk and we did compiled it in l'unité d'informatique of LLN.  it did compile it but we couldn't try it because we did not have So we find the nearest Unix system compatiblewith ours, it was in Amsterdam.  Andrew Tenebaum who did write since then a number of books about operating systems and became quite an authority. He was working there. It was the young Tanenbaum, just arriving from United States to Amsterdam. He was learning to speak dutch. We did understood his english better but his assistant insisted that he speaks dutch because he will have to pass an exam in dutch. There we got a disk, than also the one with the driver we compiled, than we got here and we start using Unix.  Than in my opinion the start of open source was Unix because we had to maintain it by ourselves and we learned a lot from the sources.\nIn that time we did had to get software and it brings us to different places. For example, at the time the agents at the custom at the airport or post didn't know what to do with the discs in terms of custom clearance. They used magnetic or xrays, we had to write on the package that it should not be x-rayed. But we got time to time unreadable discs. \n\n**So it took like weeks between the transportation, the custom...**\nYes, the custom had to clear the packages. I remember i've been in the customs in Zaventem. I had received a letter that my package from Bell Aps had arrived. I went there thinking i would have to pay something and go. But no. It had to be cleared so there wa some organisation that had to do administrative stuff, so i only got it a few days later. The response time was huge :)\n\n**Than after that period of time how did you switch from that kind of collaboration on how to make software and make software work to collaboration on networks, between universities and researchers...**\nIn the Unix system of that time there was a kind of networking protocol which only did work on serial lines.\n You could connect two unix systems together you only need a line. We had one between LLN and Leuven, it's only 15 kms, but we had to ask Belgacom, than La Régie des télégraphes et téléphones, to get a modem to connect through their network and than over that modem you could reach an amazing speed of 300 characters per second. And that was the first communication. It did happened somewhere around 85. And then you had connexion with another computer, writing something here and do  something. And we could send programs to each other. \n \n **What was the first thing you did send through a network like this?**\n I didn't do it myself, i remember it was a kind of chat program. And on LLN side was Elie Milgrom, he is retired now. On this side, it was Pr Willems. And i remember that they typed something and they got a response from the other side and that was it.  But i remember that Pr Willems sent \"ok we stop now\". And that Elie Milgrom answered \"See you later, Alligator\" [a reference to Bill Haley and the Comets].  At the time we still had these kind of songs in mind. (lol). Those Unix to Unix connexions were first. And there was a worldwide Unix to Unix based network, Usenet (1979), it still exists somewhere... you can download load  of illegal movies and that stuff, that was not what we meant at the time. But that is what is left. And Usenet became gradually replaced by the Internet in USA. In Europe, the Internet came a lot later, but we had access to the Internet, we could send mail to them and we could receive mail from them, because some friendly american university, later companies, did translate internet mail to UCP mail. That was before the 1990's.\n \n **Your relation to software had changed at the time because you did not have to do all this manipulations with the software your received... Was it already floppy discs ?**\n No, magnetic tapes, for the mainframe at least. Most of the mini-computers had some cheaper magnetic tapes. Between 90 \n

They were not open source or free,  but you could get Unix and could run it on those digital equipment (DEC) computers. That is what the computer department of the University of Louvain la Neuve *l'unité d'informatique*, did and so did we.\n\n**When did you start working with unix as an os?** \n\nI took a trip to Amsterdam, it must have been in 1979/80… Well, the story starts in our french sister university (LLN) where they did have a PDP-11 with Unix on it https://hackadaycom.files.wordpress.com/2016/08/full-size-pdp11.jpg. You got Unix, at the time, when you were a university, from Bell Aps (Ma Bell), the american telephone company. It was a mega organisation at the time [before the [dismantlment of AT&T/Bell system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breakup_of_the_Bell_System)].Due to monopoly, the US authorities splitted up in different Baby Bells. One of the restriction was there was a research baby bell, they couldn't really sell anything.There were computer scientists there, who did developped some Unix interesting things.  For universities you did get the source and no support for free. How to install it, no idea. In Unité d'informatique, they were lucky: they got the same computer that unix were developped on.  They got the disk by snail mail as a post-office package. They mounted it and it did spin up and they had it.\nHere, we did have a cheaper PDP11 (DEC - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PDP-11) We go the disk source from Bell Aps but we could not run it. We could look at it but that was all, because our disc format was different than the one at Bell Aps. Somebody here did write a driver for that disk and we did compiled it in l'unité d'informatique of LLN.  it did compile it but we couldn't try it because we did not have So we find the nearest Unix system compatiblewith ours, it was in Amsterdam.  Andrew Tenebaum who did write since then a number of books about operating systems and became quite an authority. He was working there. It was the young Tanenbaum, just arriving from United States to Amsterdam. He was learning to speak dutch. We did understood his english better but his assistant insisted that he speaks dutch because he will have to pass an exam in dutch. There we got a disk, than also the one with the driver we compiled, than we got here and we start using Unix.  Than in my opinion the start of open source was Unix because we had to maintain it by ourselves and we learned a lot from the sources.\nIn that time we did had to get software and it brings us to different places. For example, at the time the agents at the custom at the airport or post didn't know what to do with the discs in terms of custom clearance. They used magnetic or xrays, we had to write on the package that it should not be x-rayed. But we got time to time unreadable discs. \n\n**So it took like weeks between the transportation, the custom...**\nYes, the custom had to clear the packages. I remember i've been in the customs in Zaventem. I had received a letter that my package from Bell Aps had arrived. I went there thinking i would have to pay something and go. But no. It had to be cleared so there wa some organisation that had to do administrative stuff, so i only got it a few days later. The response time was huge :)\n\n**Than after that period of time how did you switch from that kind of collaboration on how to make software and make software work to collaboration on networks, between universities and researchers...**\nIn the Unix system of that time there was a kind of networking protocol which only did work on serial lines.\n You could connect two unix systems together you only need a line. We had one between LLN and Leuven, it's only 15 kms, but we had to ask Belgacom, than La Régie des télégraphes et téléphones, to get a modem to connect through their network and than over that modem you could reach an amazing speed of 300 characters per second. And that was the first communication. It did happened somewhere around 85. And then you had connexion with another computer, writing something here and do  something. And we could send programs to each other. \n \n **What was the first thing you did send through a network like this?**\n I didn't do it myself, i remember it was a kind of chat program. And on LLN side was Elie Milgrom, he is retired now. On this side, it was Pr Willems. And i remember that they typed something and they got a response from the other side and that was it.  But i remember that Pr Willems sent \"ok we stop now\". And that Elie Milgrom answered \"See you later, Alligator\" [a reference to Bill Haley and the Comets].  At the time we still had these kind of songs in mind. (lol). Those Unix to Unix connexions were first. And there was a worldwide Unix to Unix based network, Usenet (1979), it still exists somewhere... you can download load  of illegal movies and that stuff, that was not what we meant at the time. But that is what is left. And Usenet became gradually replaced by the Internet in USA. In Europe, the Internet came a lot later, but we had access to the Internet, we could send mail to them and we could receive mail from them, because some friendly american university, later companies, did translate internet mail to UCP mail. That was before the 1990's.\n \n **Your relation to software had changed at the time because you did not have to do all this manipulations with the software your received... Was it already floppy discs ?**\n No, magnetic tapes, for the mainframe at least. Most of the mini-computers had some cheaper magnetic tapes. Between 90 and 95 the main machines for the software institute was a VAX from DEC. Once a year the software came from Berkeley, it was still Unix but modified by Berkeley for virtual\n

the joy of assisting during the TGSO.**\n**I heard that that until recently, let's say the late 1990's, when learning computer programming you had to start by  writing down the program on paper... ** \n\nIn 1973, i did study computer sciences, it was the second year of the department, here in Leuven. At the time computers were mainframes and you did fed them with programms by punch cards. Programing was writing down the program, than you punched it and the next day you get results, mostly error. That's the way it worked at that time. To teach us programing, they used the langage of that time, Fortran and some kind of invented assembly langage, it didn't really exist, it was simplified.\n\nMost of the time you did write down your program, the teacher and the assistant would have to tell you what is wrong or good, you didn't had much practical experience.\n\n**How was it like, tons of pages ?** \n\nNo. As an anecdocte, i remember punchcards were a block of papers, we were jealous of the people who came in the computer center with huge stacks of cards. That were really small programs, not complicated one. The fact you had to learn to use the computer from scratch, everything was new, you couldn't rely on previous experiences, everything was new. And to start with small programs was difficult enough. \n\nThat was also the time when Edsger W. Dijkstra who forked the goto... i still remember him, in an audience, giving us a lecture on modernisation in programming at the International computing symposium 1977 in Liège (programming: from craft to scientific discipline https://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/EWD/transcriptions/EWD05xx/EWD566.html). He told usxx (i'll complete it as soon as possible. i need Jean's input)\"\n\nAnd then from 75 on, computers became cheaper and could be bought by departments and smaller entities. And than came the first interactive computer. Still beasts about two cubic meters, costing two millions belgian francs. But it was low enough to allow people to type in directly commands. I started working here in 75 as a researcher, it have evolved continuously and i saw computer getting cheaper and getting easier to use.The way to use it was simplified, you could start to go to the beast and try it out.\n\nI remember more or less: you did write down the program in Fortran for instance… We always thought in the beginning that it would work and it didn't, so after a turn around you were giving it back to the operator and you have to wait half a day or a night to get the results.\n\n**What kind of program you were working on?** \n\nI remember the first program i had to write was you got three numbers, you had to make the program decide if you construct a triangle with the numbers being the sides of the triangle.\n\n**That took an afternoon to be processed ?** \n\nWell, yeah. You had to imagine how to do it which was also one problem, than you prepare the card with the punching machine and you give the package of cards to the operator who was feeeding the computer with the cards. People had the taks to fed the computers by hands, with paper, cards, than disks and it lasts onto the magnetic disks period. And after a number of hours or a night you get a listing, a piece of paper, with the results.\n\n**When where you able to record the program onto the machine?**\n\nI think that happens between 75 and 80. After the punching cards which was already a way to record the program, we had  typewriters, terminals but we could record the programs, we could store them on the computer. We had magnetic discs. IBM had number for everything, i remember the 33-30 [manufactured from 1970 on] had a magnetic disk. We didn't touch the machines, operators would change the disks, we could only access the typewriter. That was our most direct connexion to the computer. Thetimes were diffent. The mainframes were such huge costly beasts that it had operators day and night keeping it busy. Even at night there were two or three guys mounting tapes, dismounting tapes, that kind of stuff.\nhttps://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/42/IBM_magnetic_disk_drives_3330%2B3333.png/600px-IBM_magnetic_disk_drives_3330%2B3333.png\n\n**When did you stop working with operators?** \n\nSomewhere between 85 and 90. There were still operators at the main computer of the university, but there were also small computers, so researchers and student can have direct access when needed. \n\n**When did you start to work with software sold by others or gived away in order to do your research?** \n\nYou stil need an operating system on the mainframe that was delivered by IBM or the constructor delivering the mainframe. When you bought mini-computers, which were the  smaller versions of mainframes, in most cases you did buy an operating systems, compilers and all the stuff you need to be able to program those things. In most cases, because the computer sciences department did buy the mini-computer from, for instance *digital equipment corporation*,  a manufactorer of that time, but they didn't buy their software. They were not open source or free,  but you could get Unix and could run it on those digital equipment (DEC) computers. That is what the computer department of the University of Louvain la Neuve *l'unité d'informatique*, did and so did we.\n\n**When did you start working with unix as an os?** \n\nI took a trip to Amsterdam, it must have been in 1979/80… Well, the story starts in our french sister university (LLN) where they did have a PDP-11 with Unix on it https://hackadaycom.files.wordpress.com/2016/08/full-size-pdp11.jpg. You got Unix, at the time, when you were a university, from Bell Aps (Ma Bell), the american telephone company. It was a mega organisation at the time [before the [dismantlment of AT&T/Bell system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breakup_of_the_Bell_System)].Due to monopoly, the US authorities splitted up in different Baby Bells. One of the restriction was there was a research baby bell, they couldn't really sell anything.There were computer scientists there, who did developped some Unix interesting things.  For universities you did get the source and no support for free. How to install it, no idea. In Unité d'informatique, they were lucky: they got the same computer that unix were developped on.  They got the disk by snail mail as a post-office package. They mounted it and it did spin up and they had it.\nHere, we did have a cheaper PDP11 (DEC - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PDP-11) We go the disk source from Bell Aps but we could not run it. We could look at it but that was all, because our disc format was different than the one at Bell Aps. Somebody here did write a driver for that disk and we did compiled it in l'unité d'informatique of LLN.  it did compile it but we couldn't try it because we did not have So we find the nearest Unix system compatiblewith ours, it was in Amsterdam.  Andrew Tenebaum who did write since then a number of books about operating systems and became quite an authority. He was working there. It was the young Tanenbaum, just arriving from United States to Amsterdam. He was learning to speak dutch. We did understood his english better but his assistant insisted that he speaks dutch because he will have to pass an exam in dutch. There we got a disk, than also the one with the driver we compiled, than we got here and we start using Unix.  Than in my opinion the start of open source was Unix because we had to maintain it by ourselves and we learned a lot from the sources.\nIn that time we did had to get software and it brings us to different places. For example, at the time the agents at the custom at the airport or post didn't know what to do with the discs in terms of custom clearance. They used magnetic or xrays, we had to write on the package that it should not be x-rayed. But we got time to time unreadable discs. \n\n**So it took like weeks between the transportation, the custom...**\nYes, the custom had to clear the packages. I remember i've been in the customs in Zaventem. I had received a letter that my package from Bell Aps had arrived. I went there thinking i would have to pay something and go. But no. It had to be cleared so there wa some organisation that had to do administrative stuff, so i only got it a few days later. The response time was huge :)\n\n**Than after that period of time how did you switch from that kind of collaboration on how to make software and make software work to collaboration on networks, between universities and researchers...**\nIn the Unix system of that time there was a kind of networking protocol which only did work on serial lines.\n You could connect two unix systems together you only need a line. We had one between LLN and Leuven, it's only 15 kms, but we had to ask Belgacom, than La Régie des télégraphes et téléphones, to get a modem to connect through their network and than over that modem you could reach an amazing speed of 300 characters per second. And that was the first communication. It did happened somewhere around 85. And then you had connexion with another computer, writing something here and do  something. And we could send programs to each other. \n \n **What was the first thing you did send through a network like this?**\n I didn't do it myself, i remember it was a kind of chat program. And on LLN side was Elie Milgrom, he is retired now. On this side, it was Pr Willems. And i remember that they typed something and they got a response from the other side and that was it.  But i remember that Pr Willems sent \"ok we stop now\". And that Elie Milgrom answered \"See you later, Alligator\" [a reference to Bill Haley and the Comets].  At the time we still had these kind of songs in mind. (lol). Those Unix to Unix connexions were first. And there was a worldwide Unix to Unix based network, Usenet (1979), it still exists somewhere... you can download load  of illegal movies and that stuff, that was not what we meant at the time. But that is what is left. And Usenet became gradually replaced by the Internet in USA. In Europe, the Internet came a lot later, but we had access to the Internet, we could send mail to them and we could receive mail from them, because some friendly american university, later companies, did translate internet mail to UCP mail. That was before the 1990's.\n \n **Your relation to software had changed at the time because you did not have to do all this manipulations with the software your received... Was it already floppy discs ?**\n No, magnetic tapes, for the mainframe at least. Most of the mini-computers had some cheaper magnetic tapes. Between 90 and 95 the main machines for the software institute was a VAX from DEC. Once a year the software came from Berkeley, it was still Unix but modified by Berkeley for virtual memory and all the stuff which are common now. We received a tape, with lot of goodies, i still remember we didn't know what was on there but we scrutinised there to know what was there, what we can use.\nIn Europe, com

the joy of assisting during the TGSO.**\n**I heard that that until recently, let's say the late 1990's, when learning computer programming you had to start by  writing down the program on paper... ** \n\nIn 1973, i did study computer sciences, it was the second year of the department, here in Leuven. At the time computers were mainframes and you did fed them with programms by punch cards. Programing was writing down the program, than you punched it and the next day you get results, mostly error. That's the way it worked at that time. To teach us programing, they used the langage of that time, Fortran and some kind of invented assembly langage, it didn't really exist, it was simplified.\n\nMost of the time you did write down your program, the teacher and the assistant would have to tell you what is wrong or good, you didn't had much practical experience.\n\n**How was it like, tons of pages ?** \n\nNo. As an anecdocte, i remember punchcards were a block of papers, we were jealous of the people who came in the computer center with huge stacks of cards. That were really small programs, not complicated one. The fact you had to learn to use the computer from scratch, everything was new, you couldn't rely on previous experiences, everything was new. And to start with small programs was difficult enough. \n\nThat was also the time when Edsger W. Dijkstra who forked the goto... i still remember him, in an audience, giving us a lecture on modernisation in programming at the International computing symposium 1977 in Liège (programming: from craft to scientific discipline https://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/EWD/transcriptions/EWD05xx/EWD566.html). He told usxx (i'll complete it as soon as possible. i need Jean's input)\"\n\nAnd then from 75 on, computers became cheaper and could be bought by departments and smaller entities. And than came the first interactive computer. Still beasts about two cubic meters, costing two millions belgian francs. But it was low enough to allow people to type in directly commands. I started working here in 75 as a researcher, it have evolved continuously and i saw computer getting cheaper and getting easier to use.The way to use it was simplified, you could start to go to the beast and try it out.\n\nI remember more or less: you did write down the program in Fortran for instance… We always thought in the beginning that it would work and it didn't, so after a turn around you were giving it back to the operator and you have to wait half a day or a night to get the results.\n\n**What kind of program you were working on?** \n\nI remember the first program i had to write was you got three numbers, you had to make the program decide if you construct a triangle with the numbers being the sides of the triangle.\n\n**That took an afternoon to be processed ?** \n\nWell, yeah. You had to imagine how to do it which was also one problem, than you prepare the card with the punching machine and you give the package of cards to the operator who was feeeding the computer with the cards. People had the taks to fed the computers by hands, with paper, cards, than disks and it lasts onto the magnetic disks period. And after a number of hours or a night you get a listing, a piece of paper, with the results.\n\n**When where you able to record the program onto the machine?**\n\nI think that happens between 75 and 80. After the punching cards which was already a way to record the program, we had  typewriters, terminals but we could record the programs, we could store them on the computer. We had magnetic discs. IBM had number for everything, i remember the 33-30 [manufactured from 1970 on] had a magnetic disk. We didn't touch the machines, operators would change the disks, we could only access the typewriter. That was our most direct connexion to the computer. Thetimes were diffent. The mainframes were such huge costly beasts that it had operators day and night keeping it busy. Even at night there were two or three guys mounting tapes, dismounting tapes, that kind of stuff.\nhttps://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/42/IBM_magnetic_disk_drives_3330%2B3333.png/600px-IBM_magnetic_disk_drives_3330%2B3333.png\n\n**When did you stop working with operators?** \n\nSomewhere between 85 and 90. There were still operators at the main computer of the university, but there were also small computers, so researchers and student can have direct access when needed. \n\n**When did you start to work with software sold by others or gived away in order to do your research?** \n\nYou stil need an operating system on the mainframe that was delivered by IBM or the constructor delivering the mainframe. When you bought mini-computers, which were the  smaller versions of mainframes, in most cases you did buy an operating systems, compilers and all the stuff you need to be able to program those things. In most cases, because the computer sciences department did buy the mini-computer from, for instance *digital equipment corporation*,  a manufactorer of that time, but they didn't buy their software. They were not open source or free,  but you could get Unix and could run it on those digital equipment (DEC) computers. That is what the computer department of the University of Louvain la Neuve *l'unité d'informatique*, did and so did we.\n\n**When did you start working with unix as an os?** \n\nI took a trip to Amsterdam, it must have been in 1979/80… Well, the story starts in our french sister university (LLN) where they did have a PDP-11 with Unix on it https://hackadaycom.files.wordpress.com/2016/08/full-size-pdp11.jpg. You got Unix, at the time, when you were a university, from Bell Aps (Ma Bell), the american telephone company. It was a mega organisation at the time [before the [dismantlment of AT&T/Bell system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breakup_of_the_Bell_System)].Due to monopoly, the US authorities splitted up in different Baby Bells. One of the restriction was there was a research baby bell, they couldn't really sell anything.There were computer scientists there, who did developped some Unix interesting things.  For universities you did get the source and no support for free. How to install it, no idea. In Unité d'informatique, they were lucky: they got the same computer that unix were developped on.  They got the disk by snail mail as a post-office package. They mounted it and it did spin up and they had it.\nHere, we did have a cheaper PDP11 (DEC - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PDP-11) We go the disk source from Bell Aps but we could not run it. We could look at it but that was all, because our disc format was different than the one at Bell Aps. Somebody here did write a driver for that disk and we did compiled it in l'unité d'informatique of LLN.  it did compile it but we couldn't try it because we did not have So we find the nearest Unix system compatiblewith ours, it was in Amsterdam.  Andrew Tenebaum who did write since then a number of books about operating systems and became quite an authority. He was working there. It was the young Tanenbaum, just arriving from United States to Amsterdam. He was learning to speak dutch. We did understood his english better but his assistant insisted that he speaks dutch because he will have to pass an exam in dutch. There we got a disk, than also the one with the driver we compiled, than we got here and we start using Unix.  Than in my opinion the start of open source was Unix because we had to maintain it by ourselves and we learned a lot from the sources.\nIn that time we did had to get software and it brings us to different places. For example, at the time the agents at the custom at the airport or post didn't know what to do with the discs in terms of custom clearance. They used magnetic or xrays, we had to write on the package that it should not be x-rayed. But we got time to time unreadable discs. \n\n**So it took like weeks between the transportation, the custom...**\nYes, the custom had to clear the packages. I remember i've been in the customs in Zaventem. I had received a letter that my package from Bell Aps had arrived. I went there thinking i would have to pay something and go. But no. It had to be cleared so there wa some organisation that had to do administrative stuff, so i only got it a few days later. The response time was huge :)\n\n**Than after that period of time how did you switch from that kind of collaboration on how to make software and make software work to collaboration on networks, between universities and researchers...**\nIn the Unix system of that time there was a kind of networking protocol which only did work on serial lines.\n You could connect two unix systems together you only need a line. We had one between LLN and Leuven, it's only 15 kms, but we had to ask Belgacom, than La Régie des télégraphes et téléphones, to get a modem to connect through their network and than over that modem you could reach an amazing speed of 300 characters per second. And that was the first communication. It did happened somewhere around 85. And then you had connexion with another computer, writing something here and do  something. And we could send programs to each other. \n \n **What was the first thing you did send through a network like this?**\n I didn't do it myself, i remember it was a kind of chat program. And on LLN side was Elie Milgrom, he is retired now. On this side, it was Pr Willems. And i remember that they typed something and they got a response from the other side and that was it.  But i remember that Pr Willems sent \"ok we stop now\". And that Elie Milgrom answered \"See you later, Alligator\" [a reference to Bill Haley and the Comets].  At the time we still had these kind of songs in mind. (lol). Those Unix to Unix connexions were first. And there was a worldwide Unix to Unix based network, Usenet (1979), it still exists somewhere... you can download load  of illegal movies and that stuff, that was not what we meant at the time. But that is what is left. And Usenet became gradually replaced by the Internet in USA. In Europe, the Internet came a lot later, but we had access to the Internet, we could send mail to them and we could receive mail from them, because some friendly american university, later companies, did translate internet mail to UCP mail. That was before the 1990's.\n \n **Your relation to software had changed at the time because you did not have to do all this manipulations with the software your received... Was it already floppy discs ?**\n No, magnetic tapes, for the mainframe at least. Most of the mini-computers had some cheaper magnetic tapes. Between 90 and 95 the main machines for the software institute was a VAX from DEC. Once a year the software came from Berkeley, it was still Unix but modified by Berkeley for virtual memory and all the stuff which are common now. We received a tape, with lot of goodies, i still remember we didn't know what was on there but we scrutinised there to know what was there, what we can use.\nIn Europe, companies like Siemens were trying to set up software centers to make software avaiable, they were even trying to set up networks. Researchers did love the Internet, it was useful for their re\n\n\n\n\n\n","attribs":"|1+g*6|2+2*5+3p*6|1+1*5+4f*6|2+2+dm*6|2+2+4n*6|1+1|1+1*5+11*6|2+2+bc*6|2+2+5z*2+3e*3+1*4*3+20*4+1*6|2+2+e7*6|2+2+7n*6|2+2*5+1a*6|2+2+53*6|2+2*5+19*6|2+2+c7*6|2+2*5+1r*6|2+2+jo*6|1+1+41*6|2+2*5+1a*6|2+2+5g*6|2+2*5+2w*6|2+2+l6*6|2+2*5+1f*6|2+2+8f*5+7+kh*6|1+1+uu*0|1+1+9s*0|2+2*5+1v*0|1+1+aj*0|2+2*5+5m*0|1+1+30*0|1+1+48*2+15+9l*0|1+1+1*0|1+1+1*5+1y*0|1+1+tm*0|1+1+1*0|1+1*5+4t*0|1+1+dr*0|1+1*0+3x+1*0+1p*6|5+5|1+1"}}},"pad:observatory.guide.jeanhuensitvextended:revs:3201":{"changeset":"Z:8p4>3|1n=8jb=5n*0+3$sea","meta":{"author":"a.kqv62Q3nhchdwIuK","timestamp":1518095659941}},"pad:observatory.guide.jeanhuensitvextended:revs:3202":{"changeset":"Z:8p7>2|1n=8jb=5q*0+2$rc","meta":{"author":"a.kqv62Q3nhchdwIuK","timestamp":1518095660441}},"pad:observatory.guide.jeanhuensitvextended:revs:3203":{"changeset":"Z:8p9>3|1n=8jb=5s*0+3$her","meta":{"author":"a.kqv62Q3nhchdwIuK","timestamp":1518095660942}},"pad:observatory.guide.jeanhuensitvextended:revs:3204":{"changeset":"Z:8pc<1|1n=8jb=5u-1$","meta":{"author":"a.kqv62Q3nhchdwIuK","timestamp":1518095661727}},"pad:observatory.guide.jeanhuensitvextended:revs:3205":{"changeset":"Z:8pb<2|1n=8jb=5s-2$","meta":{"author":"a.kqv62Q3nhchdwIuK","timestamp":1518095662227}},"pad:observatory.guide.jeanhuensitvextended:revs:3206":{"changeset":"Z:8p9>1|1n=8jb=5s*0+1$h","meta":{"author":"a.kqv62Q3nhchdwIuK","timestamp":1518095662945}},"pad:observatory.guide.jeanhuensitvextended:revs:3207":{"changeset":"Z:8pa>3|1n=8jb=5t*0+3$s.

__NOPUBLISH__\n\n\n**You have been using computers since a long time, as you explained us during the tour we had the joy of assisting during the TGSO.**\n**I heard that that until recently, let's say the late 1990's, when learning computer programming you had to start by  writing down the program on paper... ** \n\nIn 1973, i did study computer sciences, it was the second year of the department, here in Leuven. At the time computers were mainframes and you did fed them with programms by punch cards. Programing was writing down the program, than you punched it and the next day you get results, mostly error. That's the way it worked at that time. To teach us programing, they used the langage of that time, Fortran and some kind of invented assembly langage, it didn't really exist, it was simplified.\n\nMost of the time you did write down your program, the teacher and the assistant would have to tell you what is wrong or good, you didn't had much practical experience.\n\n**How was it like, tons of pages ?** \n\nNo. As an anecdocte, i remember punchcards were a block of papers, we were jealous of the people who came in the computer center with huge stacks of cards. That were really small programs, not complicated one. The fact you had to learn to use the computer from scratch, everything was new, you couldn't rely on previous experiences, everything was new. And to start with small programs was difficult enough. \n\nThat was also the time when Edsger W. Dijkstra who forked the goto... i still remember him, in an audience, giving us a lecture on modernisation in programming at the International computing symposium 1977 in Liège (programming: from craft to scientific discipline https://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/EWD/transcriptions/EWD05xx/EWD566.html). He told usxx (i'll complete it as soon as possible. i need Jean's input)\"\n\nAnd then from 75 on, computers became cheaper and could be bought by departments and smaller entities. And than came the first interactive computer. Still beasts about two cubic meters, costing two millions belgian francs. But it was low enough to allow people to type in directly commands. I started working here in 75 as a researcher, it have evolved continuously and i saw computer getting cheaper and getting easier to use.The way to use it was simplified, you could start to go to the beast and try it out.\n\nI remember more or less: you did write down the program in Fortran for instance… We always thought in the beginning that it would work and it didn't, so after a turn around you were giving it back to the operator and you have to wait half a day or a night to get the results.\n\n**What kind of program you were working on?** \n\nI remember the first program i had to write was you got three numbers, you had to make the program decide if you construct a triangle with the numbers being the sides of the triangle.\n\n**That took an afternoon to be processed ?** \n\nWell, yeah. You had to imagine how to do it which was also one problem, than you prepare the card with the punching machine and you give the package of cards to the operator who was feeeding the computer with the cards. People had the taks to fed the computers by hands, with paper, cards, than disks and it lasts onto the magnetic disks period. And after a number of hours or a night you get a listing, a piece of paper, with the results.\n\n**When where you able to record the program onto the machine?**\n\nI think that happens between 75 and 80. After the punching cards which was already a way to record the program, we had  typewriters, terminals but we could record the programs, we could store them on the computer. We had magnetic discs. IBM had number for everything, i remember the 33-30 [manufactured from 1970 on] had a magnetic disk. We didn't touch the machines, operators would change the disks, we could only access the typewriter. That was our most direct connexion to the computer. Thetimes were diffent. The mainframes were such huge costly beasts that it had operators day and night keeping it busy. Even at night there were two or three guys mounting tapes, dismounting tapes, that kind of stuff.\nhttps://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/42/IBM_magnetic_disk_drives_3330%2B3333.png/600px-IBM_magnetic_disk_drives_3330%2B3333.png\n\n**When did you stop working with operators?** \n\nSomewhere between 85 and 90. There were still operators at the main computer of the university, but there were also small computers, so researchers and student can have direct access when needed. \n\n**When did you start to work with software sold by others or gived away in order to do your research?** \n\nYou stil need an operating system on the mainframe that was delivered by IBM or the constructor delivering the mainframe. When you bought mini-computers, which were the  smaller versions of mainframes, in most cases you did buy an operating systems, compilers and all the stuff you need to be able to program those things. In most cases, because the computer sciences department did buy the mini-computer from, for instance *digital equipment corporation*,  a manufactorer of that time, but they didn't buy their software. They were not open source or free,  but you could get Unix and could run it on those digital equipment (DEC) computers. That is what the computer department of the University of Louvain la Neuve *l'unité d'informatique*, did and so did we.\n\n**When did you start working with unix as an os?** \n\nI took a trip to Amsterdam, it must have been in 1979/80… Well, the story starts in our french sister university (LLN) where they did have a PDP-11 with Unix on it https://hackadaycom.files.wordpress.com/2016/08/full-size-pdp11.jpg. You got Unix, at the time, when you were a university, from Bell Aps (Ma Bell), the american telephone company. It was a mega organisation at the time [before the [dismantlment of AT&T/Bell system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breakup_of_the_Bell_System)].Due to monopoly, the US authorities splitted up in different Baby Bells. One of the restriction was there was a research baby bell, they couldn't really sell anything.There were computer scientists there, who did developped some Unix interesting things.  For universities you did get the source and no support for free. How to install it, no idea. In Unité d'informatique, they were lucky: they got the same computer that unix were developped on.  They got the disk by snail mail as a post-office package. They mounted it and it did spin up and they had it.\nHere, we did have a cheaper PDP11 (DEC - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PDP-11) We go the disk source from Bell Aps but we could not run it. We could look at it but that was all, because our disc format was different than the one at Bell Aps. Somebody here did write a driver for that disk and we did compiled it in l'unité d'informatique of LLN.  it did compile it but we couldn't try it because we did not have So we find the nearest Unix system compatiblewith ours, it was in Amsterdam.  Andrew Tenebaum who did write since then a number of books about operating systems and became quite an authority. He was working there. It was the young Tanenbaum, just arriving from United States to Amsterdam. He was learning to speak dutch. We did understood his english better but his assistant insisted that he speaks dutch because he will have to pass an exam in dutch. There we got a disk, than also the one with the driver we compiled, than we got here and we start using Unix.  Than in my opinion the start of open source was Unix because we had to maintain it by ourselves and we learned a lot from the sources.\nIn that time we did had to get software and it brings us to different places. For example, at the time the agents at the custom at the airport or post didn't know what to do with the discs in terms of custom clearance. They used magnetic or xrays, we had to write on the package that it should not be x-rayed. But we got time to time unreadable discs. \n\n**So it took like weeks between the transportation, the custom...**\nYes, the custom had to clear the packages. I remember i've been in the customs in Zaventem. I had received a letter that my package from Bell Aps had arrived. I went there thinking i would have to pay something and go. But no. It had to be cleared so there wa some organisation that had to do administrative stuff, so i only got it a few days later. The response time was huge :)\n\n**Than after that period of time how did you switch from that kind of collaboration on how to make software and make software work to collaboration on networks, between universities and researchers...**\nIn the Unix system of that time there was a kind of networking protocol which only did work on serial lines.\n You could connect two unix systems together you only need a line. We had one between LLN and Leuven, it's only 15 kms, but we had to ask Belgacom, than La Régie des télégraphes et téléphones, to get a modem to connect through their network and than over that modem you could reach an amazing speed of 300 characters per second. And that was the first communication. It did happened somewhere around 85. And then you had connexion with another computer, writing something here and do  something. And we could send programs to each other. \n \n **What was the first thing you did send through a network like this?**\n I didn't do it myself, i remember it was a kind of chat program. And on LLN side was Elie Milgrom, he is retired now. On this side, it was Pr Willems. And i remember that they typed something and they got a response from the other side and that was it.  But i remember that Pr Willems sent \"ok we stop now\". And that Elie Milgrom answered \"See you later, Alligator\" [a reference to Bill Haley and the Comets].  At the time we still had these kind of songs in mind. (lol). Those Unix to Unix connexions were first. And there was a worldwide Unix to Unix based network, Usenet (1979), it still exists somewhere... you can download load  of illegal movies and that stuff, that was not what we meant at the time. But that is what is left. And Usenet became gradually replaced by the Internet in USA. In Europe, the Internet came a lot later, but we had access to the Internet, we could send mail to them and we could receive mail from them, because some friendly american university, later companies, did translate internet mail to UCP mail. That was before the 1990's.\n \n **Your relation to software had changed at the time because you did not have to do all this manipulations with the software your received... Was it already floppy discs ?**\n No, magnetic tapes, for the mainframe at least. Most of the mini-computers had some cheaper magnetic tapes. Between 90 and 95 the main machines for the software institute was a VAX from DEC. Once a year the software came from Berkeley, it was still Unix but modified by Berkeley for virtual memory and all the stuff which are common now. We received a tape, with lot of goodies, i still remember we didn't know what was on there but we scrutinised there to know what was there, what we can use.\nIn Europe, companies like Siemens were trying to set up software centers to make software avaiable, they were even trying to set up networks. Researchers did love the Internet, it worked, it was useful for their researchs. So companies in Europe, were trying to set up their own networks, i remember for example X-OPEN. Their was a lot of standards about what software layers should do,\n\n\n\n\n\n","attribs":"|1+g*6|2+2*5+3p*6|1+1*5+4f*6|2+2+dm*6|2+2+4n*6|1+1|1+1*5+11*6|2+2+bc*6|2+2+5z*2+3e*3+1*4*3+20*4+1*6|2+2+e7*6|2+2+7n*6|2+2*5+1a*6|2+2+53*6|2+2*5+19*6|2+2+c7*6|2+2*5+1r*6|2+2+jo*6|1+1+41*6|2+2*5+1a*6|2+2+5g*6|2+2*5+2w*6|2+2+l6*6|2+2*5+1f*6|2+2+8f*5+7+kh*6|1+1+uu*0|1+1+9s*0|2+2*5+1v*0|1+1+aj*0|2+2*5+5m*0|1+1+30*0|1+1+48*2+15+9l*0|1+1+1*0|1+1+1*5+1y*0|1+1+tm*0|1+1+1*0|1+1*5+4t*0|1+1+dr*0|1+1*0+3x+1*0+6s*6|5+5|1+1"}}},"pad:observatory.guide.jeanhuensitvextended:revs:3301":{"changeset":"Z:8u7>3|1n=8jb=aq*0+3$

At the time computers were mainframes and you did fed them with programms by punch cards. Programing was writing down the program, than you punched it and the next day you get results, mostly error. That's the way it worked at that time. To teach us programing, they used the langage of that time, Fortran and some kind of invented assembly langage, it didn't really exist, it was simplified.\n\nMost of the time you did write down your program, the teacher and the assistant would have to tell you what is wrong or good, you didn't had much practical experience.\n\n**How was it like, tons of pages ?** \n\nNo. As an anecdocte, i remember punchcards were a block of papers, we were jealous of the people who came in the computer center with huge stacks of cards. That were really small programs, not complicated one. The fact you had to learn to use the computer from scratch, everything was new, you couldn't rely on previous experiences, everything was new. And to start with small programs was difficult enough. \n\nThat was also the time when Edsger W. Dijkstra who forked the goto... i still remember him, in an audience, giving us a lecture on modernisation in programming at the International computing symposium 1977 in Liège (programming: from craft to scientific discipline https://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/EWD/transcriptions/EWD05xx/EWD566.html). He told usxx (i'll complete it as soon as possible. i need Jean's input)\"\n\nAnd then from 75 on, computers became cheaper and could be bought by departments and smaller entities. And than came the first interactive computer. Still beasts about two cubic meters, costing two millions belgian francs. But it was low enough to allow people to type in directly commands. I started working here in 75 as a researcher, it have evolved continuously and i saw computer getting cheaper and getting easier to use.The way to use it was simplified, you could start to go to the beast and try it out.\n\nI remember more or less: you did write down the program in Fortran for instance… We always thought in the beginning that it would work and it didn't, so after a turn around you were giving it back to the operator and you have to wait half a day or a night to get the results.\n\n**What kind of program you were working on?** \n\nI remember the first program i had to write was you got three numbers, you had to make the program decide if you construct a triangle with the numbers being the sides of the triangle.\n\n**That took an afternoon to be processed ?** \n\nWell, yeah. You had to imagine how to do it which was also one problem, than you prepare the card with the punching machine and you give the package of cards to the operator who was feeeding the computer with the cards. People had the taks to fed the computers by hands, with paper, cards, than disks and it lasts onto the magnetic disks period. And after a number of hours or a night you get a listing, a piece of paper, with the results.\n\n**When where you able to record the program onto the machine?**\n\nI think that happens between 75 and 80. After the punching cards which was already a way to record the program, we had  typewriters, terminals but we could record the programs, we could store them on the computer. We had magnetic discs. IBM had number for everything, i remember the 33-30 [manufactured from 1970 on] had a magnetic disk. We didn't touch the machines, operators would change the disks, we could only access the typewriter. That was our most direct connexion to the computer. Thetimes were diffent. The mainframes were such huge costly beasts that it had operators day and night keeping it busy. Even at night there were two or three guys mounting tapes, dismounting tapes, that kind of stuff.\nhttps://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/42/IBM_magnetic_disk_drives_3330%2B3333.png/600px-IBM_magnetic_disk_drives_3330%2B3333.png\n\n**When did you stop working with operators?** \n\nSomewhere between 85 and 90. There were still operators at the main computer of the university, but there were also small computers, so researchers and student can have direct access when needed. \n\n**When did you start to work with software sold by others or gived away in order to do your research?** \n\nYou stil need an operating system on the mainframe that was delivered by IBM or the constructor delivering the mainframe. When you bought mini-computers, which were the  smaller versions of mainframes, in most cases you did buy an operating systems, compilers and all the stuff you need to be able to program those things. In most cases, because the computer sciences department did buy the mini-computer from, for instance *digital equipment corporation*,  a manufactorer of that time, but they didn't buy their software. They were not open source or free,  but you could get Unix and could run it on those digital equipment (DEC) computers. That is what the computer department of the University of Louvain la Neuve *l'unité d'informatique*, did and so did we.\n\n**When did you start working with unix as an os?** \n\nI took a trip to Amsterdam, it must have been in 1979/80… Well, the story starts in our french sister university (LLN) where they did have a PDP-11 with Unix on it https://hackadaycom.files.wordpress.com/2016/08/full-size-pdp11.jpg. You got Unix, at the time, when you were a university, from Bell Aps (Ma Bell), the american telephone company. It was a mega organisation at the time [before the [dismantlment of AT&T/Bell system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breakup_of_the_Bell_System)].Due to monopoly, the US authorities splitted up in different Baby Bells. One of the restriction was there was a research baby bell, they couldn't really sell anything.There were computer scientists there, who did developped some Unix interesting things.  For universities you did get the source and no support for free. How to install it, no idea. In Unité d'informatique, they were lucky: they got the same computer that unix were developped on.  They got the disk by snail mail as a post-office package. They mounted it and it did spin up and they had it.\nHere, we did have a cheaper PDP11 (DEC - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PDP-11) We go the disk source from Bell Aps but we could not run it. We could look at it but that was all, because our disc format was different than the one at Bell Aps. Somebody here did write a driver for that disk and we did compiled it in l'unité d'informatique of LLN.  it did compile it but we couldn't try it because we did not have So we find the nearest Unix system compatiblewith ours, it was in Amsterdam.  Andrew Tenebaum who did write since then a number of books about operating systems and became quite an authority. He was working there. It was the young Tanenbaum, just arriving from United States to Amsterdam. He was learning to speak dutch. We did understood his english better but his assistant insisted that he speaks dutch because he will have to pass an exam in dutch. There we got a disk, than also the one with the driver we compiled, than we got here and we start using Unix.  Than in my opinion the start of open source was Unix because we had to maintain it by ourselves and we learned a lot from the sources.\nIn that time we did had to get software and it brings us to different places. For example, at the time the agents at the custom at the airport or post didn't know what to do with the discs in terms of custom clearance. They used magnetic or xrays, we had to write on the package that it should not be x-rayed. But we got time to time unreadable discs. \n\n**So it took like weeks between the transportation, the custom...**\nYes, the custom had to clear the packages. I remember i've been in the customs in Zaventem. I had received a letter that my package from Bell Aps had arrived. I went there thinking i would have to pay something and go. But no. It had to be cleared so there wa some organisation that had to do administrative stuff, so i only got it a few days later. The response time was huge :)\n\n**Than after that period of time how did you switch from that kind of collaboration on how to make software and make software work to collaboration on networks, between universities and researchers...**\nIn the Unix system of that time there was a kind of networking protocol which only did work on serial lines.\n You could connect two unix systems together you only need a line. We had one between LLN and Leuven, it's only 15 kms, but we had to ask Belgacom, than La Régie des télégraphes et téléphones, to get a modem to connect through their network and than over that modem you could reach an amazing speed of 300 characters per second. And that was the first communication. It did happened somewhere around 85. And then you had connexion with another computer, writing something here and do  something. And we could send programs to each other. \n \n **What was the first thing you did send through a network like this?**\n I didn't do it myself, i remember it was a kind of chat program. And on LLN side was Elie Milgrom, he is retired now. On this side, it was Pr Willems. And i remember that they typed something and they got a response from the other side and that was it.  But i remember that Pr Willems sent \"ok we stop now\". And that Elie Milgrom answered \"See you later, Alligator\" [a reference to Bill Haley and the Comets].  At the time we still had these kind of songs in mind. (lol). Those Unix to Unix connexions were first. And there was a worldwide Unix to Unix based network, Usenet (1979), it still exists somewhere... you can download load  of illegal movies and that stuff, that was not what we meant at the time. But that is what is left. And Usenet became gradually replaced by the Internet in USA. In Europe, the Internet came a lot later, but we had access to the Internet, we could send mail to them and we could receive mail from them, because some friendly american university, later companies, did translate internet mail to UCP mail. That was before the 1990's.\n \n **Your relation to software had changed at the time because you did not have to do all this manipulations with the software your received... Was it already floppy discs ?**\n No, magnetic tapes, for the mainframe at least. Most of the mini-computers had some cheaper magnetic tapes. Between 90 and 95 the main machines for the software institute was a VAX from DEC. Once a year the software came from Berkeley, it was still Unix but modified by Berkeley for virtual memory and all the stuff which are common now. We received a tape, with lot of goodies, i still remember we didn't know what was on there but we scrutinised there to know what was there, what we can use.\nIn Europe, companies like Siemens were trying to set up software centers to make software avaiable, they were even trying to set up networks. Researchers did love the Internet, it worked, it was useful for their researchs. So companies in Europe, were trying to set up their own networks, i remember for example X-OPEN. Their was a lot of standards about what software layers should do, but it didn't succeed because sometime, 92 maybe, IBM decided to quit their own private netwok and to go for tcp/ip, and was the switching point. Everything done

the joy of assisting during the TGSO.**\n**I heard that that until recently, let's say the late 1990's, when learning computer programming you had to start by  writing down the program on paper... ** \n\nIn 1973, i did study computer sciences, it was the second year of the department, here in Leuven. At the time computers were mainframes and you did fed them with programms by punch cards. Programing was writing down the program, than you punched it and the next day you get results, mostly error. That's the way it worked at that time. To teach us programing, they used the langage of that time, Fortran and some kind of invented assembly langage, it didn't really exist, it was simplified.\n\nMost of the time you did write down your program, the teacher and the assistant would have to tell you what is wrong or good, you didn't had much practical experience.\n\n**How was it like, tons of pages ?** \n\nNo. As an anecdocte, i remember punchcards were a block of papers, we were jealous of the people who came in the computer center with huge stacks of cards. That were really small programs, not complicated one. The fact you had to learn to use the computer from scratch, everything was new, you couldn't rely on previous experiences, everything was new. And to start with small programs was difficult enough. \n\nThat was also the time when Edsger W. Dijkstra who forked the goto... i still remember him, in an audience, giving us a lecture on modernisation in programming at the International computing symposium 1977 in Liège (programming: from craft to scientific discipline https://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/EWD/transcriptions/EWD05xx/EWD566.html). He told usxx (i'll complete it as soon as possible. i need Jean's input)\"\n\nAnd then from 75 on, computers became cheaper and could be bought by departments and smaller entities. And than came the first interactive computer. Still beasts about two cubic meters, costing two millions belgian francs. But it was low enough to allow people to type in directly commands. I started working here in 75 as a researcher, it have evolved continuously and i saw computer getting cheaper and getting easier to use.The way to use it was simplified, you could start to go to the beast and try it out.\n\nI remember more or less: you did write down the program in Fortran for instance… We always thought in the beginning that it would work and it didn't, so after a turn around you were giving it back to the operator and you have to wait half a day or a night to get the results.\n\n**What kind of program you were working on?** \n\nI remember the first program i had to write was you got three numbers, you had to make the program decide if you construct a triangle with the numbers being the sides of the triangle.\n\n**That took an afternoon to be processed ?** \n\nWell, yeah. You had to imagine how to do it which was also one problem, than you prepare the card with the punching machine and you give the package of cards to the operator who was feeeding the computer with the cards. People had the taks to fed the computers by hands, with paper, cards, than disks and it lasts onto the magnetic disks period. And after a number of hours or a night you get a listing, a piece of paper, with the results.\n\n**When where you able to record the program onto the machine?**\n\nI think that happens between 75 and 80. After the punching cards which was already a way to record the program, we had  typewriters, terminals but we could record the programs, we could store them on the computer. We had magnetic discs. IBM had number for everything, i remember the 33-30 [manufactured from 1970 on] had a magnetic disk. We didn't touch the machines, operators would change the disks, we could only access the typewriter. That was our most direct connexion to the computer. Thetimes were diffent. The mainframes were such huge costly beasts that it had operators day and night keeping it busy. Even at night there were two or three guys mounting tapes, dismounting tapes, that kind of stuff.\nhttps://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/42/IBM_magnetic_disk_drives_3330%2B3333.png/600px-IBM_magnetic_disk_drives_3330%2B3333.png\n\n**When did you stop working with operators?** \n\nSomewhere between 85 and 90. There were still operators at the main computer of the university, but there were also small computers, so researchers and student can have direct access when needed. \n\n**When did you start to work with software sold by others or gived away in order to do your research?** \n\nYou stil need an operating system on the mainframe that was delivered by IBM or the constructor delivering the mainframe. When you bought mini-computers, which were the  smaller versions of mainframes, in most cases you did buy an operating systems, compilers and all the stuff you need to be able to program those things. In most cases, because the computer sciences department did buy the mini-computer from, for instance *digital equipment corporation*,  a manufactorer of that time, but they didn't buy their software. They were not open source or free,  but you could get Unix and could run it on those digital equipment (DEC) computers. That is what the computer department of the University of Louvain la Neuve *l'unité d'informatique*, did and so did we.\n\n**When did you start working with unix as an os?** \n\nI took a trip to Amsterdam, it must have been in 1979/80… Well, the story starts in our french sister university (LLN) where they did have a PDP-11 with Unix on it https://hackadaycom.files.wordpress.com/2016/08/full-size-pdp11.jpg. You got Unix, at the time, when you were a university, from Bell Aps (Ma Bell), the american telephone company. It was a mega organisation at the time [before the [dismantlment of AT&T/Bell system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breakup_of_the_Bell_System)].Due to monopoly, the US authorities splitted up in different Baby Bells. One of the restriction was there was a research baby bell, they couldn't really sell anything.There were computer scientists there, who did developped some Unix interesting things.  For universities you did get the source and no support for free. How to install it, no idea. In Unité d'informatique, they were lucky: they got the same computer that unix were developped on.  They got the disk by snail mail as a post-office package. They mounted it and it did spin up and they had it.\nHere, we did have a cheaper PDP11 (DEC - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PDP-11) We go the disk source from Bell Aps but we could not run it. We could look at it but that was all, because our disc format was different than the one at Bell Aps. Somebody here did write a driver for that disk and we did compiled it in l'unité d'informatique of LLN.  it did compile it but we couldn't try it because we did not have So we find the nearest Unix system compatiblewith ours, it was in Amsterdam.  Andrew Tenebaum who did write since then a number of books about operating systems and became quite an authority. He was working there. It was the young Tanenbaum, just arriving from United States to Amsterdam. He was learning to speak dutch. We did understood his english better but his assistant insisted that he speaks dutch because he will have to pass an exam in dutch. There we got a disk, than also the one with the driver we compiled, than we got here and we start using Unix.  Than in my opinion the start of open source was Unix because we had to maintain it by ourselves and we learned a lot from the sources.\nIn that time we did had to get software and it brings us to different places. For example, at the time the agents at the custom at the airport or post didn't know what to do with the discs in terms of custom clearance. They used magnetic or xrays, we had to write on the package that it should not be x-rayed. But we got time to time unreadable discs. \n\n**So it took like weeks between the transportation, the custom...**\nYes, the custom had to clear the packages. I remember i've been in the customs in Zaventem. I had received a letter that my package from Bell Aps had arrived. I went there thinking i would have to pay something and go. But no. It had to be cleared so there wa some organisation that had to do administrative stuff, so i only got it a few days later. The response time was huge :)\n\n**Than after that period of time how did you switch from that kind of collaboration on how to make software and make software work to collaboration on networks, between universities and researchers...**\nIn the Unix system of that time there was a kind of networking protocol which only did work on serial lines.\n You could connect two unix systems together you only need a line. We had one between LLN and Leuven, it's only 15 kms, but we had to ask Belgacom, than La Régie des télégraphes et téléphones, to get a modem to connect through their network and than over that modem you could reach an amazing speed of 300 characters per second. And that was the first communication. It did happened somewhere around 85. And then you had connexion with another computer, writing something here and do  something. And we could send programs to each other. \n \n **What was the first thing you did send through a network like this?**\n I didn't do it myself, i remember it was a kind of chat program. And on LLN side was Elie Milgrom, he is retired now. On this side, it was Pr Willems. And i remember that they typed something and they got a response from the other side and that was it.  But i remember that Pr Willems sent \"ok we stop now\". And that Elie Milgrom answered \"See you later, Alligator\" [a reference to Bill Haley and the Comets].  At the time we still had these kind of songs in mind. (lol). Those Unix to Unix connexions were first. And there was a worldwide Unix to Unix based network, Usenet (1979), it still exists somewhere... you can download load  of illegal movies and that stuff, that was not what we meant at the time. But that is what is left. And Usenet became gradually replaced by the Internet in USA. In Europe, the Internet came a lot later, but we had access to the Internet, we could send mail to them and we could receive mail from them, because some friendly american university, later companies, did translate internet mail to UCP mail. That was before the 1990's.\n \n **Your relation to software had changed at the time because you did not have to do all this manipulations with the software your received... Was it already floppy discs ?**\n No, magnetic tapes, for the mainframe at least. Most of the mini-computers had some cheaper magnetic tapes. Between 90 and 95 the main machines for the software institute was a VAX from DEC. Once a year the software came from Berkeley, it was still Unix but modified by Berkeley for virtual memory and all the stuff which are common now. We received a tape, with lot of goodies, i still remember we didn't know what was on there but we scrutinised there to know what was there, what we can use.\nIn Europe, companies like Siemens were trying to set up software centers to make software avaiable, they were even trying to set up networks. Researchers did love the Internet, it worked, it was useful for their researchs. So companies in Europe, were trying to set up their own networks, i remember for example the X/OPEN transport protocol. Their was a lot of standards about what software layers should do, but it didn't succeed because sometime, 92 maybe, IBM decided to quit their own private network and to go for tcp/ip, and was the switching point. Everything done for X/OPEN were suddently forgotten. For the mainframes, and certainly in Belgium computing was mainly mainframes, so when IBM decided

the joy of assisting during the TGSO.**\n**I heard that that until recently, let's say the late 1990's, when learning computer programming you had to start by  writing down the program on paper... ** \n\nIn 1973, i did study computer sciences, it was the second year of the department, here in Leuven. At the time computers were mainframes and you did fed them with programms by punch cards. Programing was writing down the program, than you punched it and the next day you get results, mostly error. That's the way it worked at that time. To teach us programing, they used the langage of that time, Fortran and some kind of invented assembly langage, it didn't really exist, it was simplified.\n\nMost of the time you did write down your program, the teacher and the assistant would have to tell you what is wrong or good, you didn't had much practical experience.\n\n**How was it like, tons of pages ?** \n\nNo. As an anecdocte, i remember punchcards were a block of papers, we were jealous of the people who came in the computer center with huge stacks of cards. That were really small programs, not complicated one. The fact you had to learn to use the computer from scratch, everything was new, you couldn't rely on previous experiences, everything was new. And to start with small programs was difficult enough. \n\nThat was also the time when Edsger W. Dijkstra who forked the goto... i still remember him, in an audience, giving us a lecture on modernisation in programming at the International computing symposium 1977 in Liège (programming: from craft to scientific discipline https://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/EWD/transcriptions/EWD05xx/EWD566.html). He told usxx (i'll complete it as soon as possible. i need Jean's input)\"\n\nAnd then from 75 on, computers became cheaper and could be bought by departments and smaller entities. And than came the first interactive computer. Still beasts about two cubic meters, costing two millions belgian francs. But it was low enough to allow people to type in directly commands. I started working here in 75 as a researcher, it have evolved continuously and i saw computer getting cheaper and getting easier to use.The way to use it was simplified, you could start to go to the beast and try it out.\n\nI remember more or less: you did write down the program in Fortran for instance… We always thought in the beginning that it would work and it didn't, so after a turn around you were giving it back to the operator and you have to wait half a day or a night to get the results.\n\n**What kind of program you were working on?** \n\nI remember the first program i had to write was you got three numbers, you had to make the program decide if you construct a triangle with the numbers being the sides of the triangle.\n\n**That took an afternoon to be processed ?** \n\nWell, yeah. You had to imagine how to do it which was also one problem, than you prepare the card with the punching machine and you give the package of cards to the operator who was feeeding the computer with the cards. People had the taks to fed the computers by hands, with paper, cards, than disks and it lasts onto the magnetic disks period. And after a number of hours or a night you get a listing, a piece of paper, with the results.\n\n**When where you able to record the program onto the machine?**\n\nI think that happens between 75 and 80. After the punching cards which was already a way to record the program, we had  typewriters, terminals but we could record the programs, we could store them on the computer. We had magnetic discs. IBM had number for everything, i remember the 33-30 [manufactured from 1970 on] had a magnetic disk. We didn't touch the machines, operators would change the disks, we could only access the typewriter. That was our most direct connexion to the computer. Thetimes were diffent. The mainframes were such huge costly beasts that it had operators day and night keeping it busy. Even at night there were two or three guys mounting tapes, dismounting tapes, that kind of stuff.\nhttps://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/42/IBM_magnetic_disk_drives_3330%2B3333.png/600px-IBM_magnetic_disk_drives_3330%2B3333.png\n\n**When did you stop working with operators?** \n\nSomewhere between 85 and 90. There were still operators at the main computer of the university, but there were also small computers, so researchers and student can have direct access when needed. \n\n**When did you start to work with software sold by others or gived away in order to do your research?** \n\nYou stil need an operating system on the mainframe that was delivered by IBM or the constructor delivering the mainframe. When you bought mini-computers, which were the  smaller versions of mainframes, in most cases you did buy an operating systems, compilers and all the stuff you need to be able to program those things. In most cases, because the computer sciences department did buy the mini-computer from, for instance *digital equipment corporation*,  a manufactorer of that time, but they didn't buy their software. They were not open source or free,  but you could get Unix and could run it on those digital equipment (DEC) computers. That is what the computer department of the University of Louvain la Neuve *l'unité d'informatique*, did and so did we.\n\n**When did you start working with unix as an os?** \n\nI took a trip to Amsterdam, it must have been in 1979/80… Well, the story starts in our french sister university (LLN) where they did have a PDP-11 with Unix on it https://hackadaycom.files.wordpress.com/2016/08/full-size-pdp11.jpg. You got Unix, at the time, when you were a university, from Bell Aps (Ma Bell), the american telephone company. It was a mega organisation at the time [before the [dismantlment of AT&T/Bell system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breakup_of_the_Bell_System)].Due to monopoly, the US authorities splitted up in different Baby Bells. One of the restriction was there was a research baby bell, they couldn't really sell anything.There were computer scientists there, who did developped some Unix interesting things.  For universities you did get the source and no support for free. How to install it, no idea. In Unité d'informatique, they were lucky: they got the same computer that unix were developped on.  They got the disk by snail mail as a post-office package. They mounted it and it did spin up and they had it.\nHere, we did have a cheaper PDP11 (DEC - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PDP-11) We go the disk source from Bell Aps but we could not run it. We could look at it but that was all, because our disc format was different than the one at Bell Aps. Somebody here did write a driver for that disk and we did compiled it in l'unité d'informatique of LLN.  it did compile it but we couldn't try it because we did not have So we find the nearest Unix system compatiblewith ours, it was in Amsterdam.  Andrew Tenebaum who did write since then a number of books about operating systems and became quite an authority. He was working there. It was the young Tanenbaum, just arriving from United States to Amsterdam. He was learning to speak dutch. We did understood his english better but his assistant insisted that he speaks dutch because he will have to pass an exam in dutch. There we got a disk, than also the one with the driver we compiled, than we got here and we start using Unix.  Than in my opinion the start of open source was Unix because we had to maintain it by ourselves and we learned a lot from the sources.\nIn that time we did had to get software and it brings us to different places. For example, at the time the agents at the custom at the airport or post didn't know what to do with the discs in terms of custom clearance. They used magnetic or xrays, we had to write on the package that it should not be x-rayed. But we got time to time unreadable discs. \n\n**So it took like weeks between the transportation, the custom...**\nYes, the custom had to clear the packages. I remember i've been in the customs in Zaventem. I had received a letter that my package from Bell Aps had arrived. I went there thinking i would have to pay something and go. But no. It had to be cleared so there wa some organisation that had to do administrative stuff, so i only got it a few days later. The response time was huge :)\n\n**Than after that period of time how did you switch from that kind of collaboration on how to make software and make software work to collaboration on networks, between universities and researchers...**\nIn the Unix system of that time there was a kind of networking protocol which only did work on serial lines.\n You could connect two unix systems together you only need a line. We had one between LLN and Leuven, it's only 15 kms, but we had to ask Belgacom, than La Régie des télégraphes et téléphones, to get a modem to connect through their network and than over that modem you could reach an amazing speed of 300 characters per second. And that was the first communication. It did happened somewhere around 85. And then you had connexion with another computer, writing something here and do  something. And we could send programs to each other. \n \n **What was the first thing you did send through a network like this?**\n I didn't do it myself, i remember it was a kind of chat program. And on LLN side was Elie Milgrom, he is retired now. On this side, it was Pr Willems. And i remember that they typed something and they got a response from the other side and that was it.  But i remember that Pr Willems sent \"ok we stop now\". And that Elie Milgrom answered \"See you later, Alligator\" [a reference to Bill Haley and the Comets].  At the time we still had these kind of songs in mind. (lol). Those Unix to Unix connexions were first. And there was a worldwide Unix to Unix based network, Usenet (1979), it still exists somewhere... you can download load  of illegal movies and that stuff, that was not what we meant at the time. But that is what is left. And Usenet became gradually replaced by the Internet in USA. In Europe, the Internet came a lot later, but we had access to the Internet, we could send mail to them and we could receive mail from them, because some friendly american university, later companies, did translate internet mail to UCP mail. That was before the 1990's.\n \n **Your relation to software had changed at the time because you did not have to do all this manipulations with the software your received... Was it already floppy discs ?**\n No, magnetic tapes, for the mainframe at least. Most of the mini-computers had some cheaper magnetic tapes. Between 90 and 95 the main machines for the software institute was a VAX from DEC. Once a year the software came from Berkeley, it was still Unix but modified by Berkeley for virtual memory and all the stuff which are common now. We received a tape, with lot of goodies, i still remember we didn't know what was on there but we scrutinised there to know what was there, what we can use.\nIn Europe, companies like Siemens were trying to set up software centers to make software avaiable, they were even trying to set up networks. Researchers did love the Internet, it worked, it was useful for their researchs. So companies in Europe, were trying to set up their own networks, i remember for example the X/OPEN transport protocol. Their was a lot of standards about what software layers should do, but it didn't succeed because sometime, 92 maybe, IBM decided to quit their own private network and to go forTCP/IP and was the switching point. Everything done for X/OPEN were suddently forgotten. For the mainframes, and certainly in Belgium computing was mainly mainframes, i'm talking about universities here, so when IBM decided to go for TCP/IP we followed even though things were really slow.

At the time computers were mainframes and you did fed them with programms by punch cards. Programing was writing down the program, than you punched it and the next day you get results, mostly error. That's the way it worked at that time. To teach us programing, they used the langage of that time, Fortran and some kind of invented assembly langage, it didn't really exist, it was simplified.\n\nMost of the time you did write down your program, the teacher and the assistant would have to tell you what is wrong or good, you didn't had much practical experience.\n\n**How was it like, tons of pages ?** \n\nNo. As an anecdocte, i remember punchcards were a block of papers, we were jealous of the people who came in the computer center with huge stacks of cards. That were really small programs, not complicated one. The fact you had to learn to use the computer from scratch, everything was new, you couldn't rely on previous experiences, everything was new. And to start with small programs was difficult enough. \n\nThat was also the time when Edsger W. Dijkstra who forked the goto... i still remember him, in an audience, giving us a lecture on modernisation in programming at the International computing symposium 1977 in Liège (programming: from craft to scientific discipline https://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/EWD/transcriptions/EWD05xx/EWD566.html). He told usxx (i'll complete it as soon as possible. i need Jean's input)\"\n\nAnd then from 75 on, computers became cheaper and could be bought by departments and smaller entities. And than came the first interactive computer. Still beasts about two cubic meters, costing two millions belgian francs. But it was low enough to allow people to type in directly commands. I started working here in 75 as a researcher, it have evolved continuously and i saw computer getting cheaper and getting easier to use.The way to use it was simplified, you could start to go to the beast and try it out.\n\nI remember more or less: you did write down the program in Fortran for instance… We always thought in the beginning that it would work and it didn't, so after a turn around you were giving it back to the operator and you have to wait half a day or a night to get the results.\n\n**What kind of program you were working on?** \n\nI remember the first program i had to write was you got three numbers, you had to make the program decide if you construct a triangle with the numbers being the sides of the triangle.\n\n**That took an afternoon to be processed ?** \n\nWell, yeah. You had to imagine how to do it which was also one problem, than you prepare the card with the punching machine and you give the package of cards to the operator who was feeeding the computer with the cards. People had the taks to fed the computers by hands, with paper, cards, than disks and it lasts onto the magnetic disks period. And after a number of hours or a night you get a listing, a piece of paper, with the results.\n\n**When where you able to record the program onto the machine?**\n\nI think that happens between 75 and 80. After the punching cards which was already a way to record the program, we had  typewriters, terminals but we could record the programs, we could store them on the computer. We had magnetic discs. IBM had number for everything, i remember the 33-30 [manufactured from 1970 on] had a magnetic disk. We didn't touch the machines, operators would change the disks, we could only access the typewriter. That was our most direct connexion to the computer. Thetimes were diffent. The mainframes were such huge costly beasts that it had operators day and night keeping it busy. Even at night there were two or three guys mounting tapes, dismounting tapes, that kind of stuff.\nhttps://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/42/IBM_magnetic_disk_drives_3330%2B3333.png/600px-IBM_magnetic_disk_drives_3330%2B3333.png\n\n**When did you stop working with operators?** \n\nSomewhere between 85 and 90. There were still operators at the main computer of the university, but there were also small computers, so researchers and student can have direct access when needed. \n\n**When did you start to work with software sold by others or gived away in order to do your research?** \n\nYou stil need an operating system on the mainframe that was delivered by IBM or the constructor delivering the mainframe. When you bought mini-computers, which were the  smaller versions of mainframes, in most cases you did buy an operating systems, compilers and all the stuff you need to be able to program those things. In most cases, because the computer sciences department did buy the mini-computer from, for instance *digital equipment corporation*,  a manufactorer of that time, but they didn't buy their software. They were not open source or free,  but you could get Unix and could run it on those digital equipment (DEC) computers. That is what the computer department of the University of Louvain la Neuve *l'unité d'informatique*, did and so did we.\n\n**When did you start working with unix as an os?** \n\nI took a trip to Amsterdam, it must have been in 1979/80… Well, the story starts in our french sister university (LLN) where they did have a PDP-11 with Unix on it https://hackadaycom.files.wordpress.com/2016/08/full-size-pdp11.jpg. You got Unix, at the time, when you were a university, from Bell Aps (Ma Bell), the american telephone company. It was a mega organisation at the time [before the [dismantlment of AT&T/Bell system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breakup_of_the_Bell_System)].Due to monopoly, the US authorities splitted up in different Baby Bells. One of the restriction was there was a research baby bell, they couldn't really sell anything.There were computer scientists there, who did developped some Unix interesting things.  For universities you did get the source and no support for free. How to install it, no idea. In Unité d'informatique, they were lucky: they got the same computer that unix were developped on.  They got the disk by snail mail as a post-office package. They mounted it and it did spin up and they had it.\nHere, we did have a cheaper PDP11 (DEC - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PDP-11) We go the disk source from Bell Aps but we could not run it. We could look at it but that was all, because our disc format was different than the one at Bell Aps. Somebody here did write a driver for that disk and we did compiled it in l'unité d'informatique of LLN.  it did compile it but we couldn't try it because we did not have So we find the nearest Unix system compatiblewith ours, it was in Amsterdam.  Andrew Tenebaum who did write since then a number of books about operating systems and became quite an authority. He was working there. It was the young Tanenbaum, just arriving from United States to Amsterdam. He was learning to speak dutch. We did understood his english better but his assistant insisted that he speaks dutch because he will have to pass an exam in dutch. There we got a disk, than also the one with the driver we compiled, than we got here and we start using Unix.  Than in my opinion the start of open source was Unix because we had to maintain it by ourselves and we learned a lot from the sources.\nIn that time we did had to get software and it brings us to different places. For example, at the time the agents at the custom at the airport or post didn't know what to do with the discs in terms of custom clearance. They used magnetic or xrays, we had to write on the package that it should not be x-rayed. But we got time to time unreadable discs. \n\n**So it took like weeks between the transportation, the custom...**\nYes, the custom had to clear the packages. I remember i've been in the customs in Zaventem. I had received a letter that my package from Bell Aps had arrived. I went there thinking i would have to pay something and go. But no. It had to be cleared so there wa some organisation that had to do administrative stuff, so i only got it a few days later. The response time was huge :)\n\n**Than after that period of time how did you switch from that kind of collaboration on how to make software and make software work to collaboration on networks, between universities and researchers...**\nIn the Unix system of that time there was a kind of networking protocol which only did work on serial lines.\n You could connect two unix systems together you only need a line. We had one between LLN and Leuven, it's only 15 kms, but we had to ask Belgacom, than La Régie des télégraphes et téléphones, to get a modem to connect through their network and than over that modem you could reach an amazing speed of 300 characters per second. And that was the first communication. It did happened somewhere around 85. And then you had connexion with another computer, writing something here and do  something. And we could send programs to each other. \n \n **What was the first thing you did send through a network like this?**\n I didn't do it myself, i remember it was a kind of chat program. And on LLN side was Elie Milgrom, he is retired now. On this side, it was Pr Willems. And i remember that they typed something and they got a response from the other side and that was it.  But i remember that Pr Willems sent \"ok we stop now\". And that Elie Milgrom answered \"See you later, Alligator\" [a reference to Bill Haley and the Comets].  At the time we still had these kind of songs in mind. (lol). Those Unix to Unix connexions were first. And there was a worldwide Unix to Unix based network, Usenet (1979), it still exists somewhere... you can download load  of illegal movies and that stuff, that was not what we meant at the time. But that is what is left. And Usenet became gradually replaced by the Internet in USA. In Europe, the Internet came a lot later, but we had access to the Internet, we could send mail to them and we could receive mail from them, because some friendly american university, later companies, did translate internet mail to UCP mail. That was before the 1990's.\n \n **Your relation to software had changed at the time because you did not have to do all this manipulations with the software your received... Was it already floppy discs ?**\n No, magnetic tapes, for the mainframe at least. Most of the mini-computers had some cheaper magnetic tapes. Between 90 and 95 the main machines for the software institute was a VAX from DEC. Once a year the software came from Berkeley, it was still Unix but modified by Berkeley for virtual memory and all the stuff which are common now. We received a tape, with lot of goodies, i still remember we didn't know what was on there but we scrutinised there to know what was there, what we can use.\nIn Europe, companies like Siemens were trying to set up software centers to make software avaiable, they were even trying to set up networks. Researchers did love the Internet, it worked, it was useful for their researchs. So companies in Europe, were trying to set up their own networks, i remember for example the X/OPEN transport protocol. Their was a lot of standards about what software layers should do, but it didn't succeed because sometime, 92 maybe, IBM decided to quit their own private network and to go forTCP/IP and was the switching point. Everything done for X/OPEN were suddently forgotten. For the mainframes, and certainly in Belgium computing was mainly mainframes, i'm talking about universities here, so when IBM decided to go for TCP/IP we followed even though things were really slow. For example, Belgacom was not interested in running the Domain Name System so we did it here for some time. They were focused\n\n\n\n\nDNS in Belgium was started when USP network use the same naming the probleme\nbelgacom X25

__NOPUBLISH__\n\n\n**You have been using computers since a long time, as you explained us during the tour we had the joy of assisting during the TGSO.**\n**I heard that that until recently, let's say the late 1990's, when learning computer programming you had to start by  writing down the program on paper... ** \n\nIn 1973, i did study computer sciences, it was the second year of the department, here in Leuven. At the time computers were mainframes and you did fed them with programms by punch cards. Programing was writing down the program, than you punched it and the next day you get results, mostly error. That's the way it worked at that time. To teach us programing, they used the langage of that time, Fortran and some kind of invented assembly langage, it didn't really exist, it was simplified.\n\nMost of the time you did write down your program, the teacher and the assistant would have to tell you what is wrong or good, you didn't had much practical experience.\n\n**How was it like, tons of pages ?** \n\nNo. As an anecdocte, i remember punchcards were a block of papers, we were jealous of the people who came in the computer center with huge stacks of cards. That were really small programs, not complicated one. The fact you had to learn to use the computer from scratch, everything was new, you couldn't rely on previous experiences, everything was new. And to start with small programs was difficult enough. \n\nThat was also the time when Edsger W. Dijkstra who forked the goto... i still remember him, in an audience, giving us a lecture on modernisation in programming at the International computing symposium 1977 in Liège (programming: from craft to scientific discipline https://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/EWD/transcriptions/EWD05xx/EWD566.html). He told usxx (i'll complete it as soon as possible. i need Jean's input)\"\n\nAnd then from 75 on, computers became cheaper and could be bought by departments and smaller entities. And than came the first interactive computer. Still beasts about two cubic meters, costing two millions belgian francs. But it was low enough to allow people to type in directly commands. I started working here in 75 as a researcher, it have evolved continuously and i saw computer getting cheaper and getting easier to use.The way to use it was simplified, you could start to go to the beast and try it out.\n\nI remember more or less: you did write down the program in Fortran for instance… We always thought in the beginning that it would work and it didn't, so after a turn around you were giving it back to the operator and you have to wait half a day or a night to get the results.\n\n**What kind of program you were working on?** \n\nI remember the first program i had to write was you got three numbers, you had to make the program decide if you construct a triangle with the numbers being the sides of the triangle.\n\n**That took an afternoon to be processed ?** \n\nWell, yeah. You had to imagine how to do it which was also one problem, than you prepare the card with the punching machine and you give the package of cards to the operator who was feeeding the computer with the cards. People had the taks to fed the computers by hands, with paper, cards, than disks and it lasts onto the magnetic disks period. And after a number of hours or a night you get a listing, a piece of paper, with the results.\n\n**When where you able to record the program onto the machine?**\n\nI think that happens between 75 and 80. After the punching cards which was already a way to record the program, we had  typewriters, terminals but we could record the programs, we could store them on the computer. We had magnetic discs. IBM had number for everything, i remember the 33-30 [manufactured from 1970 on] had a magnetic disk. We didn't touch the machines, operators would change the disks, we could only access the typewriter. That was our most direct connexion to the computer. Thetimes were diffent. The mainframes were such huge costly beasts that it had operators day and night keeping it busy. Even at night there were two or three guys mounting tapes, dismounting tapes, that kind of stuff.\nhttps://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/42/IBM_magnetic_disk_drives_3330%2B3333.png/600px-IBM_magnetic_disk_drives_3330%2B3333.png\n\n**When did you stop working with operators?** \n\nSomewhere between 85 and 90. There were still operators at the main computer of the university, but there were also small computers, so researchers and student can have direct access when needed. \n\n**When did you start to work with software sold by others or gived away in order to do your research?** \n\nYou stil need an operating system on the mainframe that was delivered by IBM or the constructor delivering the mainframe. When you bought mini-computers, which were the  smaller versions of mainframes, in most cases you did buy an operating systems, compilers and all the stuff you need to be able to program those things. In most cases, because the computer sciences department did buy the mini-computer from, for instance *digital equipment corporation*,  a manufactorer of that time, but they didn't buy their software. They were not open source or free,  but you could get Unix and could run it on those digital equipment (DEC) computers. That is what the computer department of the University of Louvain la Neuve *l'unité d'informatique*, did and so did we.\n\n**When did you start working with unix as an os?** \n\nI took a trip to Amsterdam, it must have been in 1979/80… Well, the story starts in our french sister university (LLN) where they did have a PDP-11 with Unix on it https://hackadaycom.files.wordpress.com/2016/08/full-size-pdp11.jpg. You got Unix, at the time, when you were a university, from Bell Aps (Ma Bell), the american telephone company. It was a mega organisation at the time [before the [dismantlment of AT&T/Bell system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breakup_of_the_Bell_System)].Due to monopoly, the US authorities splitted up in different Baby Bells. One of the restriction was there was a research baby bell, they couldn't really sell anything.There were computer scientists there, who did developped some Unix interesting things.  For universities you did get the source and no support for free. How to install it, no idea. In Unité d'informatique, they were lucky: they got the same computer that unix were developped on.  They got the disk by snail mail as a post-office package. They mounted it and it did spin up and they had it.\nHere, we did have a cheaper PDP11 (DEC - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PDP-11) We go the disk source from Bell Aps but we could not run it. We could look at it but that was all, because our disc format was different than the one at Bell Aps. Somebody here did write a driver for that disk and we did compiled it in l'unité d'informatique of LLN.  it did compile it but we couldn't try it because we did not have So we find the nearest Unix system compatiblewith ours, it was in Amsterdam.  Andrew Tenebaum who did write since then a number of books about operating systems and became quite an authority. He was working there. It was the young Tanenbaum, just arriving from United States to Amsterdam. He was learning to speak dutch. We did understood his english better but his assistant insisted that he speaks dutch because he will have to pass an exam in dutch. There we got a disk, than also the one with the driver we compiled, than we got here and we start using Unix.  Than in my opinion the start of open source was Unix because we had to maintain it by ourselves and we learned a lot from the sources.\nIn that time we did had to get software and it brings us to different places. For example, at the time the agents at the custom at the airport or post didn't know what to do with the discs in terms of custom clearance. They used magnetic or xrays, we had to write on the package that it should not be x-rayed. But we got time to time unreadable discs. \n\n**So it took like weeks between the transportation, the custom...**\nYes, the custom had to clear the packages. I remember i've been in the customs in Zaventem. I had received a letter that my package from Bell Aps had arrived. I went there thinking i would have to pay something and go. But no. It had to be cleared so there wa some organisation that had to do administrative stuff, so i only got it a few days later. The response time was huge :)\n\n**Than after that period of time how did you switch from that kind of collaboration on how to make software and make software work to collaboration on networks, between universities and researchers...**\nIn the Unix system of that time there was a kind of networking protocol which only did work on serial lines.\n You could connect two unix systems together you only need a line. We had one between LLN and Leuven, it's only 15 kms, but we had to ask Belgacom, than La Régie des télégraphes et téléphones, to get a modem to connect through their network and than over that modem you could reach an amazing speed of 300 characters per second. And that was the first communication. It did happened somewhere around 85. And then you had connexion with another computer, writing something here and do  something. And we could send programs to each other. \n \n **What was the first thing you did send through a network like this?**\n I didn't do it myself, i remember it was a kind of chat program. And on LLN side was Elie Milgrom, he is retired now. On this side, it was Pr Willems. And i remember that they typed something and they got a response from the other side and that was it.  But i remember that Pr Willems sent \"ok we stop now\". And that Elie Milgrom answered \"See you later, Alligator\" [a reference to Bill Haley and the Comets].  At the time we still had these kind of songs in mind. (lol). Those Unix to Unix connexions were first. And there was a worldwide Unix to Unix based network, Usenet (1979), it still exists somewhere... you can download load  of illegal movies and that stuff, that was not what we meant at the time. But that is what is left. And Usenet became gradually replaced by the Internet in USA. In Europe, the Internet came a lot later, but we had access to the Internet, we could send mail to them and we could receive mail from them, because some friendly american university, later companies, did translate internet mail to UCP mail. That was before the 1990's.\n \n **Your relation to software had changed at the time because you did not have to do all this manipulations with the software your received... Was it already floppy discs ?**\n No, magnetic tapes, for the mainframe at least. Most of the mini-computers had some cheaper magnetic tapes. Between 90 and 95 the main machines for the software institute was a VAX from DEC. Once a year the software came from Berkeley, it was still Unix but modified by Berkeley for virtual memory and all the stuff which are common now. We received a tape, with lot of goodies, i still remember we didn't know what was on there but we scrutinised there to know what was there, what we can use.\nIn Europe, companies like Siemens were trying to set up software centers to make software avaiable, they were even trying to set up networks. Researchers did love the Internet, it worked, it was useful for their researchs. So companies in Europe, were trying to set up their own networks, i remember for example the X/OPEN transport protocol. Their was a lot of standards about what software layers should do, but it didn't succeed because sometime, 92 maybe, IBM decided to quit their own private network and to go forTCP/IP and was the switching point. Everything done for X/OPEN were suddently forgotten. For the mainframes, and certainly in Belgium computing was mainly mainframes, i'm talking about universities here, so when IBM decided to go for TCP/IP we followed even though things were really slow. For example, Belgacom was not interested in running the Domain Name System so we did it here, for some time, starting in 1993 with Pierre Verbaten (https://www.dnsbelgium.be/en/history). Belgacom were focused on X25 (DCS - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X.25).\n\nItthe time of the french Minitel ?

At the time computers were mainframes and you did fed them with programms by punch cards. Programing was writing down the program, than you punched it and the next day you get results, mostly error. That's the way it worked at that time. To teach us programing, they used the langage of that time, Fortran and some kind of invented assembly langage, it didn't really exist, it was simplified.\n\nMost of the time you did write down your program, the teacher and the assistant would have to tell you what is wrong or good, you didn't had much practical experience.\n\n**How was it like, tons of pages ?** \n\nNo. As an anecdocte, i remember punchcards were a block of papers, we were jealous of the people who came in the computer center with huge stacks of cards. That were really small programs, not complicated one. The fact you had to learn to use the computer from scratch, everything was new, you couldn't rely on previous experiences, everything was new. And to start with small programs was difficult enough. \n\nThat was also the time when Edsger W. Dijkstra who forked the goto... i still remember him, in an audience, giving us a lecture on modernisation in programming at the International computing symposium 1977 in Liège (programming: from craft to scientific discipline https://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/EWD/transcriptions/EWD05xx/EWD566.html). He told usxx (i'll complete it as soon as possible. i need Jean's input)\"\n\nAnd then from 75 on, computers became cheaper and could be bought by departments and smaller entities. And than came the first interactive computer. Still beasts about two cubic meters, costing two millions belgian francs. But it was low enough to allow people to type in directly commands. I started working here in 75 as a researcher, it have evolved continuously and i saw computer getting cheaper and getting easier to use.The way to use it was simplified, you could start to go to the beast and try it out.\n\nI remember more or less: you did write down the program in Fortran for instance… We always thought in the beginning that it would work and it didn't, so after a turn around you were giving it back to the operator and you have to wait half a day or a night to get the results.\n\n**What kind of program you were working on?** \n\nI remember the first program i had to write was you got three numbers, you had to make the program decide if you construct a triangle with the numbers being the sides of the triangle.\n\n**That took an afternoon to be processed ?** \n\nWell, yeah. You had to imagine how to do it which was also one problem, than you prepare the card with the punching machine and you give the package of cards to the operator who was feeeding the computer with the cards. People had the taks to fed the computers by hands, with paper, cards, than disks and it lasts onto the magnetic disks period. And after a number of hours or a night you get a listing, a piece of paper, with the results.\n\n**When where you able to record the program onto the machine?**\n\nI think that happens between 75 and 80. After the punching cards which was already a way to record the program, we had  typewriters, terminals but we could record the programs, we could store them on the computer. We had magnetic discs. IBM had number for everything, i remember the 33-30 [manufactured from 1970 on] had a magnetic disk. We didn't touch the machines, operators would change the disks, we could only access the typewriter. That was our most direct connexion to the computer. Thetimes were diffent. The mainframes were such huge costly beasts that it had operators day and night keeping it busy. Even at night there were two or three guys mounting tapes, dismounting tapes, that kind of stuff.\nhttps://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/42/IBM_magnetic_disk_drives_3330%2B3333.png/600px-IBM_magnetic_disk_drives_3330%2B3333.png\n\n**When did you stop working with operators?** \n\nSomewhere between 85 and 90. There were still operators at the main computer of the university, but there were also small computers, so researchers and student can have direct access when needed. \n\n**When did you start to work with software sold by others or gived away in order to do your research?** \n\nYou stil need an operating system on the mainframe that was delivered by IBM or the constructor delivering the mainframe. When you bought mini-computers, which were the  smaller versions of mainframes, in most cases you did buy an operating systems, compilers and all the stuff you need to be able to program those things. In most cases, because the computer sciences department did buy the mini-computer from, for instance *digital equipment corporation*,  a manufactorer of that time, but they didn't buy their software. They were not open source or free,  but you could get Unix and could run it on those digital equipment (DEC) computers. That is what the computer department of the University of Louvain la Neuve *l'unité d'informatique*, did and so did we.\n\n**When did you start working with unix as an os?** \n\nI took a trip to Amsterdam, it must have been in 1979/80… Well, the story starts in our french sister university (LLN) where they did have a PDP-11 with Unix on it https://hackadaycom.files.wordpress.com/2016/08/full-size-pdp11.jpg. You got Unix, at the time, when you were a university, from Bell Aps (Ma Bell), the american telephone company. It was a mega organisation at the time [before the [dismantlment of AT&T/Bell system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breakup_of_the_Bell_System)].Due to monopoly, the US authorities splitted up in different Baby Bells. One of the restriction was there was a research baby bell, they couldn't really sell anything.There were computer scientists there, who did developped some Unix interesting things.  For universities you did get the source and no support for free. How to install it, no idea. In Unité d'informatique, they were lucky: they got the same computer that unix were developped on.  They got the disk by snail mail as a post-office package. They mounted it and it did spin up and they had it.\nHere, we did have a cheaper PDP11 (DEC - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PDP-11) We go the disk source from Bell Aps but we could not run it. We could look at it but that was all, because our disc format was different than the one at Bell Aps. Somebody here did write a driver for that disk and we did compiled it in l'unité d'informatique of LLN.  it did compile it but we couldn't try it because we did not have So we find the nearest Unix system compatiblewith ours, it was in Amsterdam.  Andrew Tenebaum who did write since then a number of books about operating systems and became quite an authority. He was working there. It was the young Tanenbaum, just arriving from United States to Amsterdam. He was learning to speak dutch. We did understood his english better but his assistant insisted that he speaks dutch because he will have to pass an exam in dutch. There we got a disk, than also the one with the driver we compiled, than we got here and we start using Unix.  Than in my opinion the start of open source was Unix because we had to maintain it by ourselves and we learned a lot from the sources.\nIn that time we did had to get software and it brings us to different places. For example, at the time the agents at the custom at the airport or post didn't know what to do with the discs in terms of custom clearance. They used magnetic or xrays, we had to write on the package that it should not be x-rayed. But we got time to time unreadable discs. \n\n**So it took like weeks between the transportation, the custom...**\nYes, the custom had to clear the packages. I remember i've been in the customs in Zaventem. I had received a letter that my package from Bell Aps had arrived. I went there thinking i would have to pay something and go. But no. It had to be cleared so there wa some organisation that had to do administrative stuff, so i only got it a few days later. The response time was huge :)\n\n**Than after that period of time how did you switch from that kind of collaboration on how to make software and make software work to collaboration on networks, between universities and researchers...**\nIn the Unix system of that time there was a kind of networking protocol which only did work on serial lines.\n You could connect two unix systems together you only need a line. We had one between LLN and Leuven, it's only 15 kms, but we had to ask Belgacom, than La Régie des télégraphes et téléphones, to get a modem to connect through their network and than over that modem you could reach an amazing speed of 300 characters per second. And that was the first communication. It did happened somewhere around 85. And then you had connexion with another computer, writing something here and do  something. And we could send programs to each other. \n \n **What was the first thing you did send through a network like this?**\n I didn't do it myself, i remember it was a kind of chat program. And on LLN side was Elie Milgrom, he is retired now. On this side, it was Pr Willems. And i remember that they typed something and they got a response from the other side and that was it.  But i remember that Pr Willems sent \"ok we stop now\". And that Elie Milgrom answered \"See you later, Alligator\" [a reference to Bill Haley and the Comets].  At the time we still had these kind of songs in mind. (lol). Those Unix to Unix connexions were first. And there was a worldwide Unix to Unix based network, Usenet (1979), it still exists somewhere... you can download load  of illegal movies and that stuff, that was not what we meant at the time. But that is what is left. And Usenet became gradually replaced by the Internet in USA. In Europe, the Internet came a lot later, but we had access to the Internet, we could send mail to them and we could receive mail from them, because some friendly american university, later companies, did translate internet mail to UCP mail. That was before the 1990's.\n \n **Your relation to software had changed at the time because you did not have to do all this manipulations with the software your received... Was it already floppy discs ?**\n No, magnetic tapes, for the mainframe at least. Most of the mini-computers had some cheaper magnetic tapes. Between 90 and 95 the main machines for the software institute was a VAX from DEC. Once a year the software came from Berkeley, it was still Unix but modified by Berkeley for virtual memory and all the stuff which are common now. We received a tape, with lot of goodies, i still remember we didn't know what was on there but we scrutinised there to know what was there, what we can use.\nIn Europe, companies like Siemens were trying to set up software centers to make software avaiable, they were even trying to set up networks. Researchers did love the Internet, it worked, it was useful for their researchs. So companies in Europe, were trying to set up their own networks, i remember for example the X/OPEN transport protocol. Their was a lot of standards about what software layers should do, but it didn't succeed because sometime, 92 maybe, IBM decided to quit their own private network and to go forTCP/IP and was the switching point. Everything done for X/OPEN were suddently forgotten. For the mainframes, and certainly in Belgium computing was mainly mainframes, i'm talking about universities here, so when IBM decided to go for TCP/IP we followed even though things were really slow. For example, Belgacom was not interested in running the Domain Name System so we did it here, for some time, starting in 1993 with Pierre Verbaten (https://www.dnsbelgium.be/en/history). Belgacom were focused on X25 (DCS - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X.25) so they missed it.\n\nIt was like the french Minitel ? \nWell, at that time we were really jealous about Minitel. Could you imagine that? Terminals?  At home ? You could work home with a computer ! You could send email\n\n\n\n\n\n","attribs":"|1+g*6|2+2*5+3p*6|1+1*5+4f*6|2+2+dm*6|2+2+4n*6|1+1|1+1*5+11*6|2+2+bc*6|2+2+5z*2+3e*3+1*4*3+20*4+1*6|2+2+e7*6|2+2+7n*6|2+2*5+1a*6|2+2+53*6|2+2*5+19*6|2+2+c7*6|2+2*5+1r*6|2+2+jo*6|1+1+41*6|2+2*5+1a*6|2+2+5g*6|2+2*5+2w*6|2+2+l6*6|2+2*5+1f*6|2+2+8f*5+7+kh*6|1+1+uu*0|1+1+9s*0|2+2*5+1v*0|1+1+aj*0|2+2*5+5m*0|1+1+30*0|1+1+48*2+15+9l*0|1+1+1*0|1+1+1*5+1y*0|1+1+tm*0|1+1+1*0|1+1*5+4t*0|1+1+dr*0|1+1+u6*0|2+2*5+x*0|1+1*0+4h*6|5+5|1+1"}}},"pad:observatory.guide.jeanhuensitvextended:revs:3901":{"changeset":"Z:9j4>3|1q=9eh=4h*0+3$s, ","meta":{"author":"a.kqv62Q3nhchdwIuK","timestamp":1518096897333}},"pad:observatory.guide.jeanhuensitvextended:revs:3902":{"changeset":"Z:9j7<1|1q=9eh=4j-1$","meta":{"author":"a.kqv62Q3nhchdwIuK","timestamp":1518096903251}},"pad:observatory.guide.jeanhuensitvextended:revs:3903":{"changeset":"Z:9j6<1|1q=9eh=4i-1$","meta":{"author":"a.kqv62Q3nhchdwIuK","timestamp":1518096903752}},"pad:observatory.guide.jeanhuensitvextended:revs:3904":{"changeset":"Z:9j5>3|1q=9eh=4i*0+3$ !

have been using computers since a long time, as you explained us during the tour we had the joy of assisting during the TGSO.**\n**I heard that that until recently, let's say the late 1990's, when learning computer programming you had to start by  writing down the program on paper... ** \n\nIn 1973, i did study computer sciences, it was the second year of the department, here in Leuven. At the time computers were mainframes and you did fed them with programms by punch cards. Programing was writing down the program, than you punched it and the next day you get results, mostly error. That's the way it worked at that time. To teach us programing, they used the langage of that time, Fortran and some kind of invented assembly langage, it didn't really exist, it was simplified.\n\nMost of the time you did write down your program, the teacher and the assistant would have to tell you what is wrong or good, you didn't had much practical experience.\n\n*How was it like, tons of pages ?** \n\nNo. As an anecdocte, i remember punchcards were a block of papers, we were jealous of the people who came in the computer center with huge stacks of cards. That were really small programs, not complicated one. The fact you had to learn to use the computer from scratch, everything was new, you couldn't rely on previous experiences, everything was new. And to start with small programs was difficult enough. \n\nThat was also the time when Edsger W. Dijkstra who forked the goto... i still remember him, in an audience, giving us a lecture on modernisation in programming at the International computing symposium 1977 in Liège (programming: from craft to scientific discipline https://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/EWD/transcriptions/EWD05xx/EWD566.html). He told usxx (i'll complete it as soon as possible. i need Jean's input)\"\n\nAnd then from 75 on, computers became cheaper and could be bought by departments and smaller entities. And than came the first interactive computer. Still beasts about two cubic meters, costing two millions belgian francs. But it was low enough to allow people to type in directly commands. I started working here in 75 as a researcher, it have evolved continuously and i saw computer getting cheaper and getting easier to use.The way to use it was simplified, you could start to go to the beast and try it out.\n\nI remember more or less: you did write down the program in Fortran for instance… We always thought in the beginning that it would work and it didn't, so after a turn around you were giving it back to the operator and you have to wait half a day or a night to get the results.\n\n**What kind of program you were working on? ** \n\nI remember the first program i had to work on. You got three numbers, you had to make the program decide if you caxn construct a triangle with the numbers being the sides of the triangle.\n\n**That took an afternoon to be processed ?** \n\nWell, yeah. You had to imagine how to do it which was also one problem, than you prepare the card with the punching machine and you give the package of cards to the operator who was feeeding the computer with the cards. People had the taks to fed the computers by hands, with paper, cards, than disks and it lasts onto the magnetic disks period. And after a number of hours you get a listing, a piece of paper, with the results.\n\n**When where you able to record the program onto the machine?**\n\nI think that happens between 75 and 80. After the punching cards which was already a way to record the program, we had  typewriters, terminals but we could record the programs.\nWe could store onto the computer, IBM had number for everything, i remember the 33-30 [manufactured from 1970 on] had a magnetic disk. We didn't touch the machines, operators would change the disks, we could only access the typewriter. That was our most direct connexion to the computer. The mainframes were such huge costly beasts that it had operators day and night keeping it busy. Even at night there were two or three guys mounting tapes, dismounting tapes, that kind of stuff.\nhttps://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/42/IBM_magnetic_disk_drives_3330%2B3333.png/600px-IBM_magnetic_disk_drives_3330%2B3333.png\n\n**When did you stop working with operators?** \n\nSomewhere between 80 and 90. There were still operators at the main computer of the university, but there were small computers, so researchers and student can have direct access when needed.\n\n**When did you start to work with software sold by others or gived away in order to do your research?** \n\nYou did need an operating system on the mainframe that was delivered by IBM or the constructor delivering the mainframe. When you bought mini-computers, which were the  smaller versions of mainframes, in most cases you did buy an operating systems, compilers and all the stuff you need to be able to work with all those things. In most cases, because the computer sciences department did buy the mini-computer from for instance *digital equipment corporation*  a manufactorer of that time, they didn't buy the software from them. It was not open source or free,  but you could get Unix and could run it on those digital equipment computers. That is what the computer department of the University of Louvain la Neuve *l'unité d'informatique* , did.\n\n** When did you start working with unix as an os? ** \n\nI took a trip to Amsterdam in 1979/80… Well, the story starts in our french sister university (LLN) where they did have a PDP-11 with Unix on it. You got Unix, at the time, when you were a university, from Bell Aps (Ma Bell). It was a mega organisation at the time [before the dismantlment of AT&T/Bell system https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breakup_of_the_Bell_System)]. They splitted up in different Baby Bells. They couldn't sell it really. For unvirsities you did get the source and no support. How to install it ,no idea. We got the same computer that unix were developped on.  In LLN, They got the disk by snail mail as a post-office package \nHere, we did have a cheaper PDP11 (DEC - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PDP-11) We go the disk but we could not run it. Somebody here did write a driver for that disk in l'unité d'informatique of LLN.  The nearest place was in Amsterdam.  Andrew Tenebaum who did write a number of books on operating systems was working there. It was the young Tanenbaum, just arriving from United States to Amsterdam. He was learning to speak dutch. We did understood his english better but his assistant insisted that he speaks dutch because he will have to pass an exam in dutch.\nWe got a disk with, that disk we got here and we start using Unix.\n\n\n\n\n","meta":{"author":"a.FU926FFohXIBYlwp","timestamp":1518020286535}},"pad:observatory.guide.jeanhuensitvextended:revs:3940":{"changeset":"Z:9kx>3|1q=9eh=66*0+3$mal","meta":{"author":"a.kqv62Q3nhchdwIuK","timestamp":1518097099417}},"pad:observatory.guide.jeanhuensitvextended:revs:3941":{"changeset":"Z:9l0<1|1q=9eh=68-1$","meta":{"author":"a.kqv62Q3nhchdwIuK","timestamp":1518097099913}},"pad:observatory.guide.jeanhuensitvextended:revs:3942":{"changeset":"Z:9kz>2|1q=9eh=68*0+2$rk","meta":{"author":"a.kqv62Q3nhchdwIuK","timestamp":1518097100413}},"pad:observatory.guide.jeanhuensitvextended:revs:3943":{"changeset":"Z:9l1>3|1q=9eh=6a*0+3$et

You got three numbers, you had to make the program decide if you caxn construct a triangle with the numbers being the sides of the triangle.\n\n**That took an afternoon to be processed ?** \n\nWell, yeah. You had to imagine how to do it which was also one problem, than you prepare the card with the punching machine and you give the package of cards to the operator who was feeeding the computer with the cards.

There were still operators at the main computer of the university, but there were small computers, so researchers and student can have direct access when needed.\n\n**When did you start to work with software sold by others or gived away in order to do your research?** \n\nYou did need an operating system on the mainframe that was delivered by IBM or the constructor delivering the mainframe. When you bought mini-computers, which were the  smaller versions of mainframes, in most cases you did buy an operating systems, compilers and all the stuff you need to be able to work with all those things. In most cases, because the computer sciences department did buy the mini-computer from for instance *digital equipment corporation*  a manufactorer of that time, they didn't buy the software from them. It was not open source or free,  but you could get Unix and could run it on those digital equipment computers. That is what the computer department of the University of Louvain la Neuve *l'unité d'informatique* , did.\n\n**When did you start working with unix as an os? ** \n\nI took a trip to Amsterdam in 1979/80… Well, the story starts in our french sister university (LLN) where they did have a PDP-11 with Unix on it. You got Unix, at the time, when you were a university, from Bell Aps (Ma Bell). It was a mega organisation at the time [before the [dismantlment of AT&T/Bell system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breakup_of_the_Bell_System)]. They splitted up in different Baby Bells. They couldn't sell it really. For unvirsities you did get the source and no support. How to install it ,no idea. We got the same computer that unix were developped on.  In LLN, They got the disk by snail mail as a post-office package \nHere, we did have a cheaper PDP11 (DEC - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PDP-11) We go the disk but we could not run it. Somebody here did write a driver for that disk in l'unité d'informatique of LLN.  The nearest place was in Amsterdam.  Andrew Tenebaum who did write a number of books on operating systems was working there. It was the young Tanenbaum, just arriving from United States to Amsterdam. He was learning to speak dutch.

They were not open source or free,  but you could get Unix and could run it on those digital equipment (DEC) computers. That is what the computer department of the University of Louvain la Neuve *l'unité d'informatique*, did and so did we.\n\n**When did you start working with unix as an os?** \n\nI took a trip to Amsterdam, it must have been in 1979/80… Well, the story starts in our french sister university (LLN) where they did have a PDP-11 with Unix on it https://hackadaycom.files.wordpress.com/2016/08/full-size-pdp11.jpg. You got Unix, at the time, when you were a university, from Bell Aps (Ma Bell), the american telephone company. It was a mega organisation at the time [before the [dismantlment of AT&T/Bell system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breakup_of_the_Bell_System)].Due to monopoly, the US authorities splitted up in different Baby Bells. One of the restriction was there was a research baby bell, they couldn't really sell anything.There were computer scientists there, who did developped some Unix interesting things.  For universities you did get the source and no support for free. How to install it, no idea. In Unité d'informatique, they were lucky: they got the same computer that unix were developped on.  They got the disk by snail mail as a post-office package. They mounted it and it did spin up and they had it.\nHere, we did have a cheaper PDP11 (DEC - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PDP-11) We go the disk source from Bell Aps but we could not run it. We could look at it but that was all, because our disc format was different than the one at Bell Aps. Somebody here did write a driver for that disk and we did compiled it in l'unité d'informatique of LLN.  it did compile it but we couldn't try it because we did not have So we find the nearest Unix system compatiblewith ours, it was in Amsterdam.  Andrew Tenebaum who did write since then a number of books about operating systems and became quite an authority. He was working there. It was the young Tanenbaum, just arriving from United States to Amsterdam. He was learning to speak dutch. We did understood his english better but his assistant insisted that he speaks dutch because he will have to pass an exam in dutch. There we got a disk, than also the one with the driver we compiled, than we got here and we start using Unix.  Than in my opinion the start of open source was Unix because we had to maintain it by ourselves and we learned a lot from the sources.\nIn that time we did had to get software and it brings us to different places. For example, at the time the agents at the custom at the airport or post didn't know what to do with the discs in terms of custom clearance. They used magnetic or xrays, we had to write on the package that it should not be x-rayed. But we got time to time unreadable discs. \n\n**So it took like weeks between the transportation, the custom...**\nYes, the custom had to clear the packages. I remember i've been in the customs in Zaventem. I had received a letter that my package from Bell Aps had arrived. I went there thinking i would have to pay something and go. But no. It had to be cleared so there wa some organisation that had to do administrative stuff, so i only got it a few days later. The response time was huge :)\n\n**Than after that period of time how did you switch from that kind of collaboration on how to make software and make software work to collaboration on networks, between universities and researchers...**\nIn the Unix system of that time there was a kind of networking protocol which only did work on serial lines.\n You could connect two unix systems together you only need a line. We had one between LLN and Leuven, it's only 15 kms, but we had to ask Belgacom, than La Régie des télégraphes et téléphones, to get a modem to connect through their network and than over that modem you could reach an amazing speed of 300 characters per second. And that was the first communication. It did happened somewhere around 85. And then you had connexion with another computer, writing something here and do  something. And we could send programs to each other. \n \n **What was the first thing you did send through a network like this?**\n I didn't do it myself, i remember it was a kind of chat program. And on LLN side was Elie Milgrom, he is retired now. On this side, it was Pr Willems. And i remember that they typed something and they got a response from the other side and that was it.  But i remember that Pr Willems sent \"ok we stop now\". And that Elie Milgrom answered \"See you later, Alligator\" [a reference to Bill Haley and the Comets].  At the time we still had these kind of songs in mind. (lol). Those Unix to Unix connexions were first. And there was a worldwide Unix to Unix based network, Usenet (1979), it still exists somewhere... you can download load  of illegal movies and that stuff, that was not what we meant at the time. But that is what is left. And Usenet became gradually replaced by the Internet in USA. In Europe, the Internet came a lot later, but we had access to the Internet, we could send mail to them and we could receive mail from them, because some friendly american university, later companies, did translate internet mail to UCP mail. That was before the 1990's.\n \n **Your relation to software had changed at the time because you did not have to do all this manipulations with the software your received... Was it already floppy discs ?**\n No, magnetic tapes, for the mainframe at least. Most of the mini-computers had some cheaper magnetic tapes. Between 90 and 95 the main machines for the software institute was a VAX from DEC. Once a year the software came from Berkeley, it was still Unix but modified by Berkeley for virtual memory and all the stuff which are common now. We received a tape, with lot of goodies, i still remember we didn't know what was on there but we scrutinised there to know what was there, what we can use.\nIn Europe, companies like Siemens were trying to set up software centers to make software avaiable, they were even trying to set up networks. Researchers did love the Internet, it worked, it was useful for their researchs. So companies in Europe, were trying to set up their own networks, i remember for example the X/OPEN transport protocol. Their was a lot of standards about what software layers should do, but it didn't succeed because sometime, 92 maybe, IBM decided to quit their own private network and to go forTCP/IP and was the switching point. Everything done for X/OPEN were suddently forgotten. For the mainframes, and certainly in Belgium computing was mainly mainframes, i'm talking about universities here, so when IBM decided to go for TCP/IP we followed even though things were really slow. For example, Belgacom was not interested in running the Domain Name System so we did it here, for some time, starting in 1993 with Pierre Verbaten (https://www.dnsbelgium.be/en/history). Belgacom were focused on X25 (DCS - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X.25) so they missed it.\n\nIt was like the french Minitel ? \nWell, at that time we were really jealous about Minitel. Could you imagine that? Terminals?  At home ? You could work home with a computer ! You could send emails !

the joy of assisting during the TGSO.**\n**I heard that that until recently, let's say the late 1990's, when learning computer programming you had to start by  writing down the program on paper... ** \n\nIn 1973, i did study computer sciences, it was the second year of the department, here in Leuven. At the time computers were mainframes and you did fed them with programms by punch cards. Programing was writing down the program, than you punched it and the next day you get results, mostly error. That's the way it worked at that time. To teach us programing, they used the langage of that time, Fortran and some kind of invented assembly langage, it didn't really exist, it was simplified.\n\nMost of the time you did write down your program, the teacher and the assistant would have to tell you what is wrong or good, you didn't had much practical experience.\n\n**How was it like, tons of pages ?** \n\nNo. As an anecdocte, i remember punchcards were a block of papers, we were jealous of the people who came in the computer center with huge stacks of cards. That were really small programs, not complicated one. The fact you had to learn to use the computer from scratch, everything was new, you couldn't rely on previous experiences, everything was new. And to start with small programs was difficult enough. \n\nThat was also the time when Edsger W. Dijkstra who forked the goto... i still remember him, in an audience, giving us a lecture on modernisation in programming at the International computing symposium 1977 in Liège (programming: from craft to scientific discipline https://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/EWD/transcriptions/EWD05xx/EWD566.html). He told usxx (i'll complete it as soon as possible. i need Jean's input)\"\n\nAnd then from 75 on, computers became cheaper and could be bought by departments and smaller entities. And than came the first interactive computer. Still beasts about two cubic meters, costing two millions belgian francs. But it was low enough to allow people to type in directly commands. I started working here in 75 as a researcher, it have evolved continuously and i saw computer getting cheaper and getting easier to use.The way to use it was simplified, you could start to go to the beast and try it out.\n\nI remember more or less: you did write down the program in Fortran for instance… We always thought in the beginning that it would work and it didn't, so after a turn around you were giving it back to the operator and you have to wait half a day or a night to get the results.\n\n**What kind of program you were working on?** \n\nI remember the first program i had to write was you got three numbers, you had to make the program decide if you construct a triangle with the numbers being the sides of the triangle.\n\n**That took an afternoon to be processed ?** \n\nWell, yeah. You had to imagine how to do it which was also one problem, than you prepare the card with the punching machine and you give the package of cards to the operator who was feeeding the computer with the cards. People had the taks to fed the computers by hands, with paper, cards, than disks and it lasts onto the magnetic disks period. And after a number of hours or a night you get a listing, a piece of paper, with the results.\n\n**When where you able to record the program onto the machine?**\n\nI think that happens between 75 and 80. After the punching cards which was already a way to record the program, we had  typewriters, terminals but we could record the programs, we could store them on the computer. We had magnetic discs. IBM had number for everything, i remember the 33-30 [manufactured from 1970 on] had a magnetic disk. We didn't touch the machines, operators would change the disks, we could only access the typewriter. That was our most direct connexion to the computer. Thetimes were diffent. The mainframes were such huge costly beasts that it had operators day and night keeping it busy. Even at night there were two or three guys mounting tapes, dismounting tapes, that kind of stuff.\nhttps://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/42/IBM_magnetic_disk_drives_3330%2B3333.png/600px-IBM_magnetic_disk_drives_3330%2B3333.png\n\n**When did you stop working with operators?** \n\nSomewhere between 85 and 90. There were still operators at the main computer of the university, but there were also small computers, so researchers and student can have direct access when needed. \n\n**When did you start to work with software sold by others or gived away in order to do your research?** \n\nYou stil need an operating system on the mainframe that was delivered by IBM or the constructor delivering the mainframe. When you bought mini-computers, which were the  smaller versions of mainframes, in most cases you did buy an operating systems, compilers and all the stuff you need to be able to program those things. In most cases, because the computer sciences department did buy the mini-computer from, for instance *digital equipment corporation*,  a manufactorer of that time, but they didn't buy their software. They were not open source or free,  but you could get Unix and could run it on those digital equipment (DEC) computers. That is what the computer department of the University of Louvain la Neuve *l'unité d'informatique*, did and so did we.\n\n**When did you start working with unix as an os?** \n\nI took a trip to Amsterdam, it must have been in 1979/80… Well, the story starts in our french sister university (LLN) where they did have a PDP-11 with Unix on it https://hackadaycom.files.wordpress.com/2016/08/full-size-pdp11.jpg. You got Unix, at the time, when you were a university, from Bell Aps (Ma Bell), the american telephone company. It was a mega organisation at the time [before the [dismantlment of AT&T/Bell system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breakup_of_the_Bell_System)].Due to monopoly, the US authorities splitted up in different Baby Bells. One of the restriction was there was a research baby bell, they couldn't really sell anything.There were computer scientists there, who did developped some Unix interesting things.  For universities you did get the source and no support for free. How to install it, no idea. In Unité d'informatique, they were lucky: they got the same computer that unix were developped on.  They got the disk by snail mail as a post-office package. They mounted it and it did spin up and they had it.\nHere, we did have a cheaper PDP11 (DEC - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PDP-11) We go the disk source from Bell Aps but we could not run it. We could look at it but that was all, because our disc format was different than the one at Bell Aps. Somebody here did write a driver for that disk and we did compiled it in l'unité d'informatique of LLN.  it did compile it but we couldn't try it because we did not have So we find the nearest Unix system compatiblewith ours, it was in Amsterdam.  Andrew Tenebaum who did write since then a number of books about operating systems and became quite an authority. He was working there. It was the young Tanenbaum, just arriving from United States to Amsterdam. He was learning to speak dutch. We did understood his english better but his assistant insisted that he speaks dutch because he will have to pass an exam in dutch. There we got a disk, than also the one with the driver we compiled, than we got here and we start using Unix.  Than in my opinion the start of open source was Unix because we had to maintain it by ourselves and we learned a lot from the sources.\nIn that time we did had to get software and it brings us to different places. For example, at the time the agents at the custom at the airport or post didn't know what to do with the discs in terms of custom clearance. They used magnetic or xrays, we had to write on the package that it should not be x-rayed. But we got time to time unreadable discs. \n\n**So it took like weeks between the transportation, the custom...**\nYes, the custom had to clear the packages. I remember i've been in the customs in Zaventem. I had received a letter that my package from Bell Aps had arrived. I went there thinking i would have to pay something and go. But no. It had to be cleared so there wa some organisation that had to do administrative stuff, so i only got it a few days later. The response time was huge :)\n\n**Than after that period of time how did you switch from that kind of collaboration on how to make software and make software work to collaboration on networks, between universities and researchers...**\nIn the Unix system of that time there was a kind of networking protocol which only did work on serial lines.\n You could connect two unix systems together you only need a line. We had one between LLN and Leuven, it's only 15 kms, but we had to ask Belgacom, than La Régie des télégraphes et téléphones, to get a modem to connect through their network and than over that modem you could reach an amazing speed of 300 characters per second. And that was the first communication. It did happened somewhere around 85. And then you had connexion with another computer, writing something here and do  something. And we could send programs to each other. \n \n **What was the first thing you did send through a network like this?**\n I didn't do it myself, i remember it was a kind of chat program. And on LLN side was Elie Milgrom, he is retired now. On this side, it was Pr Willems. And i remember that they typed something and they got a response from the other side and that was it.  But i remember that Pr Willems sent \"ok we stop now\". And that Elie Milgrom answered \"See you later, Alligator\" [a reference to Bill Haley and the Comets].  At the time we still had these kind of songs in mind. (lol). Those Unix to Unix connexions were first. And there was a worldwide Unix to Unix based network, Usenet (1979), it still exists somewhere... you can download load  of illegal movies and that stuff, that was not what we meant at the time. But that is what is left. And Usenet became gradually replaced by the Internet in USA. In Europe, the Internet came a lot later, but we had access to the Internet, we could send mail to them and we could receive mail from them, because some friendly american university, later companies, did translate internet mail to UCP mail. That was before the 1990's.\n \n **Your relation to software had changed at the time because you did not have to do all this manipulations with the software your received... Was it already floppy discs ?**\n No, magnetic tapes, for the mainframe at least. Most of the mini-computers had some cheaper magnetic tapes. Between 90 and 95 the main machines for the software institute was a VAX from DEC. Once a year the software came from Berkeley, it was still Unix but modified by Berkeley for virtual memory and all the stuff which are common now. We received a tape, with lot of goodies, i still remember we didn't know what was on there but we scrutinised there to know what was there, what we can use.\nIn Europe, companies like Siemens were trying to set up software centers to make software avaiable, they were even trying to set up networks. Researchers did love the Internet, it worked, it was useful for their researchs. So companies in Europe, were trying to set up their own networks, i remember for example the X/OPEN transport protocol. Their was a lot of standards about what software layers should do, but it didn't succeed because sometime, 92 maybe, IBM decided to quit their own private network and to go forTCP/IP and was the switching point. Everything done for X/OPEN were suddently forgotten. For the mainframes, and certainly in Belgium computing was mainly mainframes, i'm talking about universities here, so when IBM decided to go for TCP/IP we followed even though things were really slow. For example, Belgacom was not interested in running the Domain Name System so we did it here, for some time, starting in 1993 with Pierre Verbaten (https://www.dnsbelgium.be/en/history). Belgacom were focused on X25 (DCS - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X.25) so they missed it.\n\nIt was like the french Minitel ? \nWell, at that time we were really jealous about Minitel. Could you imagine that? Terminals?  At home ? You could work home with a computer ! You could send emails ! All in one, a pc computer with a modem ! \n\nHow did the research about software evolved in the department.\nI am mainly talking about network research but here there were people working on numerical analysis, computing, artificial intelligence ... I was just not involved in those research so i do\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","attribs":"|1+g*6|2+2*5+3p*6|1+1*5+4f*6|2+2+dm*6|2+2+4n*6|1+1|1+1*5+11*6|2+2+bc*6|2+2+5z*2+3e*3+1*4*3+20*4+1*6|2+2+e7*6|2+2+7n*6|2+2*5+1a*6|2+2+53*6|2+2*5+19*6|2+2+c7*6|2+2*5+1r*6|2+2+jo*6|1+1+41*6|2+2*5+1a*6|2+2+5g*6|2+2*5+2w*6|2+2+l6*6|2+2*5+1f*6|2+2+8f*5+7+kh*6|1+1+uu*0|1+1+9s*0|2+2*5+1v*0|1+1+aj*0|2+2*5+5m*0|1+1+30*0|1+1+48*2+15+9l*0|1+1+1*0|1+1+1*5+1y*0|1+1+tm*0|1+1+1*0|1+1*5+4t*0|1+1+dr*0|1+1+u6*0|2+2*5+x*0|1+1+5q*0|6+75*6|5+5|1+1"}}},"pad:observatory.guide.jeanhuensitvextended:revs:4101":{"changeset":"Z:9ri>3|1t=9m0=59*0+3$n't","meta":{"author":"a.kqv62Q3nhchdwIuK","timestamp":1518097291294}},"pad:observatory.guide.jeanhuensitvextended:revs:4102":{"changeset":"Z:9rl>2|1t=9m0=5c*0+2$

__NOPUBLISH__\n\n\n**You have been using computers since a long time, as you explained us during the tour we had the joy of assisting during the TGSO.**\n**I heard that that until recently, let's say the late 1990's, when learning computer programming you had to start by  writing down the program on paper... ** \n\nIn 1973, i did study computer sciences, it was the second year of the department, here in Leuven. At the time computers were mainframes and you did fed them with programms by punch cards. Programing was writing down the program, than you punched it and the next day you get results, mostly error. That's the way it worked at that time. To teach us programing, they used the langage of that time, Fortran and some kind of invented assembly langage, it didn't really exist, it was simplified.\n\nMost of the time you did write down your program, the teacher and the assistant would have to tell you what is wrong or good, you didn't had much practical experience.\n\n**How was it like, tons of pages ?** \n\nNo. As an anecdocte, i remember punchcards were a block of papers, we were jealous of the people who came in the computer center with huge stacks of cards. That were really small programs, not complicated one. The fact you had to learn to use the computer from scratch, everything was new, you couldn't rely on previous experiences, everything was new. And to start with small programs was difficult enough. \n\nThat was also the time when Edsger W. Dijkstra who forked the goto... i still remember him, in an audience, giving us a lecture on modernisation in programming at the International computing symposium 1977 in Liège (programming: from craft to scientific discipline https://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/EWD/transcriptions/EWD05xx/EWD566.html). He told usxx (i'll complete it as soon as possible. i need Jean's input)\"\n\nAnd then from 75 on, computers became cheaper and could be bought by departments and smaller entities. And than came the first interactive computer. Still beasts about two cubic meters, costing two millions belgian francs. But it was low enough to allow people to type in directly commands. I started working here in 75 as a researcher, it have evolved continuously and i saw computer getting cheaper and getting easier to use.The way to use it was simplified, you could start to go to the beast and try it out.\n\nI remember more or less: you did write down the program in Fortran for instance… We always thought in the beginning that it would work and it didn't, so after a turn around you were giving it back to the operator and you have to wait half a day or a night to get the results.\n\n**What kind of program you were working on?** \n\nI remember the first program i had to write was you got three numbers, you had to make the program decide if you construct a triangle with the numbers being the sides of the triangle.\n\n**That took an afternoon to be processed ?** \n\nWell, yeah. You had to imagine how to do it which was also one problem, than you prepare the card with the punching machine and you give the package of cards to the operator who was feeeding the computer with the cards. People had the taks to fed the computers by hands, with paper, cards, than disks and it lasts onto the magnetic disks period. And after a number of hours or a night you get a listing, a piece of paper, with the results.\n\n**When where you able to record the program onto the machine?**\n\nI think that happens between 75 and 80. After the punching cards which was already a way to record the program, we had  typewriters, terminals but we could record the programs, we could store them on the computer. We had magnetic discs. IBM had number for everything, i remember the 33-30 [manufactured from 1970 on] had a magnetic disk. We didn't touch the machines, operators would change the disks, we could only access the typewriter. That was our most direct connexion to the computer. Thetimes were diffent. The mainframes were such huge costly beasts that it had operators day and night keeping it busy. Even at night there were two or three guys mounting tapes, dismounting tapes, that kind of stuff.\nhttps://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/42/IBM_magnetic_disk_drives_3330%2B3333.png/600px-IBM_magnetic_disk_drives_3330%2B3333.png\n\n**When did you stop working with operators?** \n\nSomewhere between 85 and 90. There were still operators at the main computer of the university, but there were also small computers, so researchers and student can have direct access when needed. \n\n**When did you start to work with software sold by others or gived away in order to do your research?** \n\nYou stil need an operating system on the mainframe that was delivered by IBM or the constructor delivering the mainframe. When you bought mini-computers, which were the  smaller versions of mainframes, in most cases you did buy an operating systems, compilers and all the stuff you need to be able to program those things. In most cases, because the computer sciences department did buy the mini-computer from, for instance *digital equipment corporation*,  a manufactorer of that time, but they didn't buy their software. They were not open source or free,  but you could get Unix and could run it on those digital equipment (DEC) computers. That is what the computer department of the University of Louvain la Neuve *l'unité d'informatique*, did and so did we.\n\n**When did you start working with unix as an os?** \n\nI took a trip to Amsterdam, it must have been in 1979/80… Well, the story starts in our french sister university (LLN) where they did have a PDP-11 with Unix on it https://hackadaycom.files.wordpress.com/2016/08/full-size-pdp11.jpg. You got Unix, at the time, when you were a university, from Bell Aps (Ma Bell), the american telephone company. It was a mega organisation at the time [before the [dismantlment of AT&T/Bell system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breakup_of_the_Bell_System)].Due to monopoly, the US authorities splitted up in different Baby Bells. One of the restriction was there was a research baby bell, they couldn't really sell anything.There were computer scientists there, who did developped some Unix interesting things.  For universities you did get the source and no support for free. How to install it, no idea. In Unité d'informatique, they were lucky: they got the same computer that unix were developped on.  They got the disk by snail mail as a post-office package. They mounted it and it did spin up and they had it.\nHere, we did have a cheaper PDP11 (DEC - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PDP-11) We go the disk source from Bell Aps but we could not run it. We could look at it but that was all, because our disc format was different than the one at Bell Aps. Somebody here did write a driver for that disk and we did compiled it in l'unité d'informatique of LLN.  it did compile it but we couldn't try it because we did not have So we find the nearest Unix system compatiblewith ours, it was in Amsterdam.  Andrew Tenebaum who did write since then a number of books about operating systems and became quite an authority. He was working there. It was the young Tanenbaum, just arriving from United States to Amsterdam. He was learning to speak dutch. We did understood his english better but his assistant insisted that he speaks dutch because he will have to pass an exam in dutch. There we got a disk, than also the one with the driver we compiled, than we got here and we start using Unix.  Than in my opinion the start of open source was Unix because we had to maintain it by ourselves and we learned a lot from the sources.\nIn that time we did had to get software and it brings us to different places. For example, at the time the agents at the custom at the airport or post didn't know what to do with the discs in terms of custom clearance. They used magnetic or xrays, we had to write on the package that it should not be x-rayed. But we got time to time unreadable discs. \n\n**So it took like weeks between the transportation, the custom...**\nYes, the custom had to clear the packages. I remember i've been in the customs in Zaventem. I had received a letter that my package from Bell Aps had arrived. I went there thinking i would have to pay something and go. But no. It had to be cleared so there wa some organisation that had to do administrative stuff, so i only got it a few days later. The response time was huge :)\n\n**Than after that period of time how did you switch from that kind of collaboration on how to make software and make software work to collaboration on networks, between universities and researchers...**\nIn the Unix system of that time there was a kind of networking protocol which only did work on serial lines.\n You could connect two unix systems together you only need a line. We had one between LLN and Leuven, it's only 15 kms, but we had to ask Belgacom, than La Régie des télégraphes et téléphones, to get a modem to connect through their network and than over that modem you could reach an amazing speed of 300 characters per second. And that was the first communication. It did happened somewhere around 85. And then you had connexion with another computer, writing something here and do  something. And we could send programs to each other. \n \n **What was the first thing you did send through a network like this?**\n I didn't do it myself, i remember it was a kind of chat program. And on LLN side was Elie Milgrom, he is retired now. On this side, it was Pr Willems. And i remember that they typed something and they got a response from the other side and that was it.  But i remember that Pr Willems sent \"ok we stop now\". And that Elie Milgrom answered \"See you later, Alligator\" [a reference to Bill Haley and the Comets].  At the time we still had these kind of songs in mind. (lol). Those Unix to Unix connexions were first. And there was a worldwide Unix to Unix based network, Usenet (1979), it still exists somewhere... you can download load  of illegal movies and that stuff, that was not what we meant at the time. But that is what is left. And Usenet became gradually replaced by the Internet in USA. In Europe, the Internet came a lot later, but we had access to the Internet, we could send mail to them and we could receive mail from them, because some friendly american university, later companies, did translate internet mail to UCP mail. That was before the 1990's.\n \n **Your relation to software had changed at the time because you did not have to do all this manipulations with the software your received... Was it already floppy discs ?**\n No, magnetic tapes, for the mainframe at least. Most of the mini-computers had some cheaper magnetic tapes. Between 90 and 95 the main machines for the software institute was a VAX from DEC. Once a year the software came from Berkeley, it was still Unix but modified by Berkeley for virtual memory and all the stuff which are common now. We received a tape, with lot of goodies, i still remember we didn't know what was on there but we scrutinised there to know what was there, what we can use.\nIn Europe, companies like Siemens were trying to set up software centers to make software avaiable, they were even trying to set up networks. Researchers did love the Internet, it worked, it was useful for their researchs. So companies in Europe, were trying to set up their own networks, i remember for example the X/OPEN transport protocol. Their was a lot of standards about what software layers should do, but it didn't succeed because sometime, 92 maybe, IBM decided to quit their own private network and to go forTCP/IP and was the switching point. Everything done for X/OPEN were suddently forgotten. For the mainframes, and certainly in Belgium computing was mainly mainframes, i'm talking about universities here, so when IBM decided to go for TCP/IP we followed even though things were really slow. For example, Belgacom was not interested in running the Domain Name System so we did it here, for some time, starting in 1993 with Pierre Verbaten (https://www.dnsbelgium.be/en/history). Belgacom were focused on X25 (DCS - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X.25) so they missed it.\n\nIt was like the french Minitel ? \nWell, at that time we were really jealous about Minitel. Could you imagine that? Terminals?  At home ? You could work home with a computer ! You could send emails ! All in one, a pc computer with a modem ! \n\nHow did the research about software evolved in the department?\nI am mainly talking about network research but here there were people working on numerical analysis, computing, artificial intelligence ... I was just not involved in those research so i don't know much about it \n\nYou were focused on software and network..\nYes we did produce some software. We did make software to generate compil\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","attribs":"|1+g*6|2+2*5+3p*6|1+1*5+4f*6|2+2+dm*6|2+2+4n*6|1+1|1+1*5+11*6|2+2+bc*6|2+2+5z*2+3e*3+1*4*3+20*4+1*6|2+2+e7*6|2+2+7n*6|2+2*5+1a*6|2+2+53*6|2+2*5+19*6|2+2+c7*6|2+2*5+1r*6|2+2+jo*6|1+1+41*6|2+2*5+1a*6|2+2+5g*6|2+2*5+2w*6|2+2+l6*6|2+2*5+1f*6|2+2+8f*5+7+kh*6|1+1+uu*0|1+1+9s*0|2+2*5+1v*0|1+1+aj*0|2+2*5+5m*0|1+1+30*0|1+1+48*2+15+9l*0|1+1+1*0|1+1+1*5+1y*0|1+1+tm*0|1+1+1*0|1+1*5+4t*0|1+1+dr*0|1+1+u6*0|2+2*5+x*0|1+1+5q*0|2+2*5+1q*0|1+1+5w*0|2+2*5+16*0|1+1+x*0|3+17*6|5+5|1+1"}}},"pad:observatory.guide.jeanhuensitvextended:revs:4201":{"changeset":"Z:9vf>4|1w=9t5=21*0+4$ers,","meta":{"author":"a.kqv62Q3nhchdwIuK","timestamp":1518097376119}},"pad:observatory.guide.jeanhuensitvextended:revs:4202":{"changeset":"Z:9vj>1|1w=9t5=25*0+1$

__NOPUBLISH__\n\n\n**You have been using computers since a long time, as you explained us during the tour we had the joy of assisting during the TGSO.**\n**I heard that that until recently, let's say the late 1990's, when learning computer programming you had to start by  writing down the program on paper... ** \n\nIn 1973, i did study computer sciences, it was the second year of the department, here in Leuven. At the time computers were mainframes and you did fed them with programms by punch cards. Programing was writing down the program, than you punched it and the next day you get results, mostly error. That's the way it worked at that time. To teach us programing, they used the langage of that time, Fortran and some kind of invented assembly langage, it didn't really exist, it was simplified.\n\nMost of the time you did write down your program, the teacher and the assistant would have to tell you what is wrong or good, you didn't had much practical experience.\n\n**How was it like, tons of pages ?** \n\nNo. As an anecdocte, i remember punchcards were a block of papers, we were jealous of the people who came in the computer center with huge stacks of cards. That were really small programs, not complicated one. The fact you had to learn to use the computer from scratch, everything was new, you couldn't rely on previous experiences, everything was new. And to start with small programs was difficult enough. \n\nThat was also the time when Edsger W. Dijkstra who forked the goto... i still remember him, in an audience, giving us a lecture on modernisation in programming at the International computing symposium 1977 in Liège (programming: from craft to scientific discipline https://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/EWD/transcriptions/EWD05xx/EWD566.html). He told usxx (i'll complete it as soon as possible. i need Jean's input)\"\n\nAnd then from 75 on, computers became cheaper and could be bought by departments and smaller entities. And than came the first interactive computer. Still beasts about two cubic meters, costing two millions belgian francs. But it was low enough to allow people to type in directly commands. I started working here in 75 as a researcher, it have evolved continuously and i saw computer getting cheaper and getting easier to use.The way to use it was simplified, you could start to go to the beast and try it out.\n\nI remember more or less: you did write down the program in Fortran for instance… We always thought in the beginning that it would work and it didn't, so after a turn around you were giving it back to the operator and you have to wait half a day or a night to get the results.\n\n**What kind of program you were working on?** \n\nI remember the first program i had to write was you got three numbers, you had to make the program decide if you construct a triangle with the numbers being the sides of the triangle.\n\n**That took an afternoon to be processed ?** \n\nWell, yeah. You had to imagine how to do it which was also one problem, than you prepare the card with the punching machine and you give the package of cards to the operator who was feeeding the computer with the cards. People had the taks to fed the computers by hands, with paper, cards, than disks and it lasts onto the magnetic disks period. And after a number of hours or a night you get a listing, a piece of paper, with the results.\n\n**When where you able to record the program onto the machine?**\n\nI think that happens between 75 and 80. After the punching cards which was already a way to record the program, we had  typewriters, terminals but we could record the programs, we could store them on the computer. We had magnetic discs. IBM had number for everything, i remember the 33-30 [manufactured from 1970 on] had a magnetic disk. We didn't touch the machines, operators would change the disks, we could only access the typewriter. That was our most direct connexion to the computer. Thetimes were diffent. The mainframes were such huge costly beasts that it had operators day and night keeping it busy. Even at night there were two or three guys mounting tapes, dismounting tapes, that kind of stuff.\nhttps://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/42/IBM_magnetic_disk_drives_3330%2B3333.png/600px-IBM_magnetic_disk_drives_3330%2B3333.png\n\n**When did you stop working with operators?** \n\nSomewhere between 85 and 90. There were still operators at the main computer of the university, but there were also small computers, so researchers and student can have direct access when needed. \n\n**When did you start to work with software sold by others or gived away in order to do your research?** \n\nYou stil need an operating system on the mainframe that was delivered by IBM or the constructor delivering the mainframe. When you bought mini-computers, which were the  smaller versions of mainframes, in most cases you did buy an operating systems, compilers and all the stuff you need to be able to program those things. In most cases, because the computer sciences department did buy the mini-computer from, for instance *digital equipment corporation*,  a manufactorer of that time, but they didn't buy their software. They were not open source or free,  but you could get Unix and could run it on those digital equipment (DEC) computers. That is what the computer department of the University of Louvain la Neuve *l'unité d'informatique*, did and so did we.\n\n**When did you start working with unix as an os?** \n\nI took a trip to Amsterdam, it must have been in 1979/80… Well, the story starts in our french sister university (LLN) where they did have a PDP-11 with Unix on it https://hackadaycom.files.wordpress.com/2016/08/full-size-pdp11.jpg. You got Unix, at the time, when you were a university, from Bell Aps (Ma Bell), the american telephone company. It was a mega organisation at the time [before the [dismantlment of AT&T/Bell system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breakup_of_the_Bell_System)].Due to monopoly, the US authorities splitted up in different Baby Bells. One of the restriction was there was a research baby bell, they couldn't really sell anything.There were computer scientists there, who did developped some Unix interesting things.  For universities you did get the source and no support for free. How to install it, no idea. In Unité d'informatique, they were lucky: they got the same computer that unix were developped on.  They got the disk by snail mail as a post-office package. They mounted it and it did spin up and they had it.\nHere, we did have a cheaper PDP11 (DEC - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PDP-11) We go the disk source from Bell Aps but we could not run it. We could look at it but that was all, because our disc format was different than the one at Bell Aps. Somebody here did write a driver for that disk and we did compiled it in l'unité d'informatique of LLN.  it did compile it but we couldn't try it because we did not have So we find the nearest Unix system compatiblewith ours, it was in Amsterdam.  Andrew Tenebaum who did write since then a number of books about operating systems and became quite an authority. He was working there. It was the young Tanenbaum, just arriving from United States to Amsterdam. He was learning to speak dutch. We did understood his english better but his assistant insisted that he speaks dutch because he will have to pass an exam in dutch. There we got a disk, than also the one with the driver we compiled, than we got here and we start using Unix.  Than in my opinion the start of open source was Unix because we had to maintain it by ourselves and we learned a lot from the sources.\nIn that time we did had to get software and it brings us to different places. For example, at the time the agents at the custom at the airport or post didn't know what to do with the discs in terms of custom clearance. They used magnetic or xrays, we had to write on the package that it should not be x-rayed. But we got time to time unreadable discs. \n\n**So it took like weeks between the transportation, the custom...**\nYes, the custom had to clear the packages. I remember i've been in the customs in Zaventem. I had received a letter that my package from Bell Aps had arrived. I went there thinking i would have to pay something and go. But no. It had to be cleared so there wa some organisation that had to do administrative stuff, so i only got it a few days later. The response time was huge :)\n\n**Than after that period of time how did you switch from that kind of collaboration on how to make software and make software work to collaboration on networks, between universities and researchers...**\nIn the Unix system of that time there was a kind of networking protocol which only did work on serial lines.\n You could connect two unix systems together you only need a line. We had one between LLN and Leuven, it's only 15 kms, but we had to ask Belgacom, than La Régie des télégraphes et téléphones, to get a modem to connect through their network and than over that modem you could reach an amazing speed of 300 characters per second. And that was the first communication. It did happened somewhere around 85. And then you had connexion with another computer, writing something here and do  something. And we could send programs to each other. \n \n **What was the first thing you did send through a network like this?**\n I didn't do it myself, i remember it was a kind of chat program. And on LLN side was Elie Milgrom, he is retired now. On this side, it was Pr Willems. And i remember that they typed something and they got a response from the other side and that was it.  But i remember that Pr Willems sent \"ok we stop now\". And that Elie Milgrom answered \"See you later, Alligator\" [a reference to Bill Haley and the Comets].  At the time we still had these kind of songs in mind. (lol). Those Unix to Unix connexions were first. And there was a worldwide Unix to Unix based network, Usenet (1979), it still exists somewhere... you can download load  of illegal movies and that stuff, that was not what we meant at the time. But that is what is left. And Usenet became gradually replaced by the Internet in USA. In Europe, the Internet came a lot later, but we had access to the Internet, we could send mail to them and we could receive mail from them, because some friendly american university, later companies, did translate internet mail to UCP mail. That was before the 1990's.\n \n **Your relation to software had changed at the time because you did not have to do all this manipulations with the software your received... Was it already floppy discs ?**\n No, magnetic tapes, for the mainframe at least. Most of the mini-computers had some cheaper magnetic tapes. Between 90 and 95 the main machines for the software institute was a VAX from DEC. Once a year the software came from Berkeley, it was still Unix but modified by Berkeley for virtual memory and all the stuff which are common now. We received a tape, with lot of goodies, i still remember we didn't know what was on there but we scrutinised there to know what was there, what we can use.\nIn Europe, companies like Siemens were trying to set up software centers to make software avaiable, they were even trying to set up networks. Researchers did love the Internet, it worked, it was useful for their researchs. So companies in Europe, were trying to set up their own networks, i remember for example the X/OPEN transport protocol. Their was a lot of standards about what software layers should do, but it didn't succeed because sometime, 92 maybe, IBM decided to quit their own private network and to go forTCP/IP and was the switching point. Everything done for X/OPEN were suddently forgotten. For the mainframes, and certainly in Belgium computing was mainly mainframes, i'm talking about universities here, so when IBM decided to go for TCP/IP we followed even though things were really slow. For example, Belgacom was not interested in running the Domain Name System so we did it here, for some time, starting in 1993 with Pierre Verbaten (https://www.dnsbelgium.be/en/history). Belgacom were focused on X25 (DCS - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X.25) so they missed it.\n\nIt was like the french Minitel ? \nWell, at that time we were really jealous about Minitel. Could you imagine that? Terminals?  At home ? You could work home with a computer ! You could send emails ! All in one, a pc computer with a modem ! \n\nHow did the research about software evolved in the department?\nI am mainly talking about network research but here there were people working on numerical analysis, computing, artificial intelligence ... I was just not involved in those research so i don't know much about it \n\nYou were focused on software and network..\nYes, we did produce some software. We did make software to generate compilers, there was some A.I. software in Prolog, numerical analysis  libraries... Some were sold or shared, it depends.  \nI remember that

At the time computers were mainframes and you did fed them with programms by punch cards. Programing was writing down the program, than you punched it and the next day you get results, mostly error. That's the way it worked at that time. To teach us programing, they used the langage of that time, Fortran and some kind of invented assembly langage, it didn't really exist, it was simplified.\n\nMost of the time you did write down your program, the teacher and the assistant would have to tell you what is wrong or good, you didn't had much practical experience.\n\n**How was it like, tons of pages ?** \n\nNo. As an anecdocte, i remember punchcards were a block of papers, we were jealous of the people who came in the computer center with huge stacks of cards. That were really small programs, not complicated one. The fact you had to learn to use the computer from scratch, everything was new, you couldn't rely on previous experiences, everything was new. And to start with small programs was difficult enough. \n\nThat was also the time when Edsger W. Dijkstra who forked the goto... i still remember him, in an audience, giving us a lecture on modernisation in programming at the International computing symposium 1977 in Liège (programming: from craft to scientific discipline https://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/EWD/transcriptions/EWD05xx/EWD566.html). He told usxx (i'll complete it as soon as possible. i need Jean's input)\"\n\nAnd then from 75 on, computers became cheaper and could be bought by departments and smaller entities. And than came the first interactive computer. Still beasts about two cubic meters, costing two millions belgian francs. But it was low enough to allow people to type in directly commands. I started working here in 75 as a researcher, it have evolved continuously and i saw computer getting cheaper and getting easier to use.The way to use it was simplified, you could start to go to the beast and try it out.\n\nI remember more or less: you did write down the program in Fortran for instance… We always thought in the beginning that it would work and it didn't, so after a turn around you were giving it back to the operator and you have to wait half a day or a night to get the results.\n\n**What kind of program you were working on?** \n\nI remember the first program i had to write was you got three numbers, you had to make the program decide if you construct a triangle with the numbers being the sides of the triangle.\n\n**That took an afternoon to be processed ?** \n\nWell, yeah. You had to imagine how to do it which was also one problem, than you prepare the card with the punching machine and you give the package of cards to the operator who was feeeding the computer with the cards. People had the taks to fed the computers by hands, with paper, cards, than disks and it lasts onto the magnetic disks period. And after a number of hours or a night you get a listing, a piece of paper, with the results.\n\n**When where you able to record the program onto the machine?**\n\nI think that happens between 75 and 80. After the punching cards which was already a way to record the program, we had  typewriters, terminals but we could record the programs, we could store them on the computer. We had magnetic discs. IBM had number for everything, i remember the 33-30 [manufactured from 1970 on] had a magnetic disk. We didn't touch the machines, operators would change the disks, we could only access the typewriter. That was our most direct connexion to the computer. Thetimes were diffent. The mainframes were such huge costly beasts that it had operators day and night keeping it busy. Even at night there were two or three guys mounting tapes, dismounting tapes, that kind of stuff.\nhttps://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/42/IBM_magnetic_disk_drives_3330%2B3333.png/600px-IBM_magnetic_disk_drives_3330%2B3333.png\n\n**When did you stop working with operators?** \n\nSomewhere between 85 and 90. There were still operators at the main computer of the university, but there were also small computers, so researchers and student can have direct access when needed. \n\n**When did you start to work with software sold by others or gived away in order to do your research?** \n\nYou stil need an operating system on the mainframe that was delivered by IBM or the constructor delivering the mainframe. When you bought mini-computers, which were the  smaller versions of mainframes, in most cases you did buy an operating systems, compilers and all the stuff you need to be able to program those things. In most cases, because the computer sciences department did buy the mini-computer from, for instance *digital equipment corporation*,  a manufactorer of that time, but they didn't buy their software. They were not open source or free,  but you could get Unix and could run it on those digital equipment (DEC) computers. That is what the computer department of the University of Louvain la Neuve *l'unité d'informatique*, did and so did we.\n\n**When did you start working with unix as an os?** \n\nI took a trip to Amsterdam, it must have been in 1979/80… Well, the story starts in our french sister university (LLN) where they did have a PDP-11 with Unix on it https://hackadaycom.files.wordpress.com/2016/08/full-size-pdp11.jpg. You got Unix, at the time, when you were a university, from Bell Aps (Ma Bell), the american telephone company. It was a mega organisation at the time [before the [dismantlment of AT&T/Bell system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breakup_of_the_Bell_System)].Due to monopoly, the US authorities splitted up in different Baby Bells. One of the restriction was there was a research baby bell, they couldn't really sell anything.There were computer scientists there, who did developped some Unix interesting things.  For universities you did get the source and no support for free. How to install it, no idea. In Unité d'informatique, they were lucky: they got the same computer that unix were developped on.  They got the disk by snail mail as a post-office package. They mounted it and it did spin up and they had it.\nHere, we did have a cheaper PDP11 (DEC - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PDP-11) We go the disk source from Bell Aps but we could not run it. We could look at it but that was all, because our disc format was different than the one at Bell Aps. Somebody here did write a driver for that disk and we did compiled it in l'unité d'informatique of LLN.  it did compile it but we couldn't try it because we did not have So we find the nearest Unix system compatiblewith ours, it was in Amsterdam.  Andrew Tenebaum who did write since then a number of books about operating systems and became quite an authority. He was working there. It was the young Tanenbaum, just arriving from United States to Amsterdam. He was learning to speak dutch. We did understood his english better but his assistant insisted that he speaks dutch because he will have to pass an exam in dutch. There we got a disk, than also the one with the driver we compiled, than we got here and we start using Unix.  Than in my opinion the start of open source was Unix because we had to maintain it by ourselves and we learned a lot from the sources.\nIn that time we did had to get software and it brings us to different places. For example, at the time the agents at the custom at the airport or post didn't know what to do with the discs in terms of custom clearance. They used magnetic or xrays, we had to write on the package that it should not be x-rayed. But we got time to time unreadable discs. \n\n**So it took like weeks between the transportation, the custom...**\nYes, the custom had to clear the packages. I remember i've been in the customs in Zaventem. I had received a letter that my package from Bell Aps had arrived. I went there thinking i would have to pay something and go. But no. It had to be cleared so there wa some organisation that had to do administrative stuff, so i only got it a few days later. The response time was huge :)\n\n**Than after that period of time how did you switch from that kind of collaboration on how to make software and make software work to collaboration on networks, between universities and researchers...**\nIn the Unix system of that time there was a kind of networking protocol which only did work on serial lines.\n You could connect two unix systems together you only need a line. We had one between LLN and Leuven, it's only 15 kms, but we had to ask Belgacom, than La Régie des télégraphes et téléphones, to get a modem to connect through their network and than over that modem you could reach an amazing speed of 300 characters per second. And that was the first communication. It did happened somewhere around 85. And then you had connexion with another computer, writing something here and do  something. And we could send programs to each other. \n \n **What was the first thing you did send through a network like this?**\n I didn't do it myself, i remember it was a kind of chat program. And on LLN side was Elie Milgrom, he is retired now. On this side, it was Pr Willems. And i remember that they typed something and they got a response from the other side and that was it.  But i remember that Pr Willems sent \"ok we stop now\". And that Elie Milgrom answered \"See you later, Alligator\" [a reference to Bill Haley and the Comets].  At the time we still had these kind of songs in mind. (lol). Those Unix to Unix connexions were first. And there was a worldwide Unix to Unix based network, Usenet (1979), it still exists somewhere... you can download load  of illegal movies and that stuff, that was not what we meant at the time. But that is what is left. And Usenet became gradually replaced by the Internet in USA. In Europe, the Internet came a lot later, but we had access to the Internet, we could send mail to them and we could receive mail from them, because some friendly american university, later companies, did translate internet mail to UCP mail. That was before the 1990's.\n \n **Your relation to software had changed at the time because you did not have to do all this manipulations with the software your received... Was it already floppy discs ?**\n No, magnetic tapes, for the mainframe at least. Most of the mini-computers had some cheaper magnetic tapes. Between 90 and 95 the main machines for the software institute was a VAX from DEC. Once a year the software came from Berkeley, it was still Unix but modified by Berkeley for virtual memory and all the stuff which are common now. We received a tape, with lot of goodies, i still remember we didn't know what was on there but we scrutinised there to know what was there, what we can use.\nIn Europe, companies like Siemens were trying to set up software centers to make software avaiable, they were even trying to set up networks. Researchers did love the Internet, it worked, it was useful for their researchs. So companies in Europe, were trying to set up their own networks, i remember for example the X/OPEN transport protocol. Their was a lot of standards about what software layers should do, but it didn't succeed because sometime, 92 maybe, IBM decided to quit their own private network and to go forTCP/IP and was the switching point. Everything done for X/OPEN were suddently forgotten. For the mainframes, and certainly in Belgium computing was mainly mainframes, i'm talking about universities here, so when IBM decided to go for TCP/IP we followed even though things were really slow. For example, Belgacom was not interested in running the Domain Name System so we did it here, for some time, starting in 1993 with Pierre Verbaten (https://www.dnsbelgium.be/en/history). Belgacom were focused on X25 (DCS - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X.25) so they missed it.\n\nIt was like the french Minitel ? \nWell, at that time we were really jealous about Minitel. Could you imagine that? Terminals?  At home ? You could work home with a computer ! You could send emails ! All in one, a pc computer with a modem ! \n\nHow did the research about software evolved in the department?\nI am mainly talking about network research but here there were people working on numerical analysis, computing, artificial intelligence ... I was just not involved in those research so i don't know much about it \n\nYou were focused on software and network..\nYes, we did produce some software. We did make software to generate compilers, there was some A.I. software in Prolog, numerical analysis  libraries... Some were sold or shared, it depends.  \nWe did sell some software since the beginning i think when it was not even a department but a professor and a couple of students.\n\nIs it when you joined ? \nNo it was already a department. I did

At the time computers were mainframes and you did fed them with programms by punch cards. Programing was writing down the program, than you punched it and the next day you get results, mostly error. That's the way it worked at that time. To teach us programing, they used the langage of that time, Fortran and some kind of invented assembly langage, it didn't really exist, it was simplified.\n\nMost of the time you did write down your program, the teacher and the assistant would have to tell you what is wrong or good, you didn't had much practical experience.\n\n**How was it like, tons of pages ?** \n\nNo. As an anecdocte, i remember punchcards were a block of papers, we were jealous of the people who came in the computer center with huge stacks of cards. That were really small programs, not complicated one. The fact you had to learn to use the computer from scratch, everything was new, you couldn't rely on previous experiences, everything was new. And to start with small programs was difficult enough. \n\nThat was also the time when Edsger W. Dijkstra who forked the goto... i still remember him, in an audience, giving us a lecture on modernisation in programming at the International computing symposium 1977 in Liège (programming: from craft to scientific discipline https://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/EWD/transcriptions/EWD05xx/EWD566.html). He told usxx (i'll complete it as soon as possible. i need Jean's input)\"\n\nAnd then from 75 on, computers became cheaper and could be bought by departments and smaller entities. And than came the first interactive computer. Still beasts about two cubic meters, costing two millions belgian francs. But it was low enough to allow people to type in directly commands. I started working here in 75 as a researcher, it have evolved continuously and i saw computer getting cheaper and getting easier to use.The way to use it was simplified, you could start to go to the beast and try it out.\n\nI remember more or less: you did write down the program in Fortran for instance… We always thought in the beginning that it would work and it didn't, so after a turn around you were giving it back to the operator and you have to wait half a day or a night to get the results.\n\n**What kind of program you were working on?** \n\nI remember the first program i had to write was you got three numbers, you had to make the program decide if you construct a triangle with the numbers being the sides of the triangle.\n\n**That took an afternoon to be processed ?** \n\nWell, yeah. You had to imagine how to do it which was also one problem, than you prepare the card with the punching machine and you give the package of cards to the operator who was feeeding the computer with the cards. People had the taks to fed the computers by hands, with paper, cards, than disks and it lasts onto the magnetic disks period. And after a number of hours or a night you get a listing, a piece of paper, with the results.\n\n**When where you able to record the program onto the machine?**\n\nI think that happens between 75 and 80. After the punching cards which was already a way to record the program, we had  typewriters, terminals but we could record the programs, we could store them on the computer. We had magnetic discs. IBM had number for everything, i remember the 33-30 [manufactured from 1970 on] had a magnetic disk. We didn't touch the machines, operators would change the disks, we could only access the typewriter. That was our most direct connexion to the computer. Thetimes were diffent. The mainframes were such huge costly beasts that it had operators day and night keeping it busy. Even at night there were two or three guys mounting tapes, dismounting tapes, that kind of stuff.\nhttps://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/42/IBM_magnetic_disk_drives_3330%2B3333.png/600px-IBM_magnetic_disk_drives_3330%2B3333.png\n\n**When did you stop working with operators?** \n\nSomewhere between 85 and 90. There were still operators at the main computer of the university, but there were also small computers, so researchers and student can have direct access when needed. \n\n**When did you start to work with software sold by others or gived away in order to do your research?** \n\nYou stil need an operating system on the mainframe that was delivered by IBM or the constructor delivering the mainframe. When you bought mini-computers, which were the  smaller versions of mainframes, in most cases you did buy an operating systems, compilers and all the stuff you need to be able to program those things. In most cases, because the computer sciences department did buy the mini-computer from, for instance *digital equipment corporation*,  a manufactorer of that time, but they didn't buy their software. They were not open source or free,  but you could get Unix and could run it on those digital equipment (DEC) computers. That is what the computer department of the University of Louvain la Neuve *l'unité d'informatique*, did and so did we.\n\n**When did you start working with unix as an os?** \n\nI took a trip to Amsterdam, it must have been in 1979/80… Well, the story starts in our french sister university (LLN) where they did have a PDP-11 with Unix on it https://hackadaycom.files.wordpress.com/2016/08/full-size-pdp11.jpg. You got Unix, at the time, when you were a university, from Bell Aps (Ma Bell), the american telephone company. It was a mega organisation at the time [before the [dismantlment of AT&T/Bell system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breakup_of_the_Bell_System)].Due to monopoly, the US authorities splitted up in different Baby Bells. One of the restriction was there was a research baby bell, they couldn't really sell anything.There were computer scientists there, who did developped some Unix interesting things.  For universities you did get the source and no support for free. How to install it, no idea. In Unité d'informatique, they were lucky: they got the same computer that unix were developped on.  They got the disk by snail mail as a post-office package. They mounted it and it did spin up and they had it.\nHere, we did have a cheaper PDP11 (DEC - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PDP-11) We go the disk source from Bell Aps but we could not run it. We could look at it but that was all, because our disc format was different than the one at Bell Aps. Somebody here did write a driver for that disk and we did compiled it in l'unité d'informatique of LLN.  it did compile it but we couldn't try it because we did not have So we find the nearest Unix system compatiblewith ours, it was in Amsterdam.  Andrew Tenebaum who did write since then a number of books about operating systems and became quite an authority. He was working there. It was the young Tanenbaum, just arriving from United States to Amsterdam. He was learning to speak dutch. We did understood his english better but his assistant insisted that he speaks dutch because he will have to pass an exam in dutch. There we got a disk, than also the one with the driver we compiled, than we got here and we start using Unix.  Than in my opinion the start of open source was Unix because we had to maintain it by ourselves and we learned a lot from the sources.\nIn that time we did had to get software and it brings us to different places. For example, at the time the agents at the custom at the airport or post didn't know what to do with the discs in terms of custom clearance. They used magnetic or xrays, we had to write on the package that it should not be x-rayed. But we got time to time unreadable discs. \n\n**So it took like weeks between the transportation, the custom...**\nYes, the custom had to clear the packages. I remember i've been in the customs in Zaventem. I had received a letter that my package from Bell Aps had arrived. I went there thinking i would have to pay something and go. But no. It had to be cleared so there wa some organisation that had to do administrative stuff, so i only got it a few days later. The response time was huge :)\n\n**Than after that period of time how did you switch from that kind of collaboration on how to make software and make software work to collaboration on networks, between universities and researchers...**\nIn the Unix system of that time there was a kind of networking protocol which only did work on serial lines.\n You could connect two unix systems together you only need a line. We had one between LLN and Leuven, it's only 15 kms, but we had to ask Belgacom, than La Régie des télégraphes et téléphones, to get a modem to connect through their network and than over that modem you could reach an amazing speed of 300 characters per second. And that was the first communication. It did happened somewhere around 85. And then you had connexion with another computer, writing something here and do  something. And we could send programs to each other. \n \n **What was the first thing you did send through a network like this?**\n I didn't do it myself, i remember it was a kind of chat program. And on LLN side was Elie Milgrom, he is retired now. On this side, it was Pr Willems. And i remember that they typed something and they got a response from the other side and that was it.  But i remember that Pr Willems sent \"ok we stop now\". And that Elie Milgrom answered \"See you later, Alligator\" [a reference to Bill Haley and the Comets].  At the time we still had these kind of songs in mind. (lol). Those Unix to Unix connexions were first. And there was a worldwide Unix to Unix based network, Usenet (1979), it still exists somewhere... you can download load  of illegal movies and that stuff, that was not what we meant at the time. But that is what is left. And Usenet became gradually replaced by the Internet in USA. In Europe, the Internet came a lot later, but we had access to the Internet, we could send mail to them and we could receive mail from them, because some friendly american university, later companies, did translate internet mail to UCP mail. That was before the 1990's.\n \n **Your relation to software had changed at the time because you did not have to do all this manipulations with the software your received... Was it already floppy discs ?**\n No, magnetic tapes, for the mainframe at least. Most of the mini-computers had some cheaper magnetic tapes. Between 90 and 95 the main machines for the software institute was a VAX from DEC. Once a year the software came from Berkeley, it was still Unix but modified by Berkeley for virtual memory and all the stuff which are common now. We received a tape, with lot of goodies, i still remember we didn't know what was on there but we scrutinised there to know what was there, what we can use.\nIn Europe, companies like Siemens were trying to set up software centers to make software avaiable, they were even trying to set up networks. Researchers did love the Internet, it worked, it was useful for their researchs. So companies in Europe, were trying to set up their own networks, i remember for example the X/OPEN transport protocol. Their was a lot of standards about what software layers should do, but it didn't succeed because sometime, 92 maybe, IBM decided to quit their own private network and to go forTCP/IP and was the switching point. Everything done for X/OPEN were suddently forgotten. For the mainframes, and certainly in Belgium computing was mainly mainframes, i'm talking about universities here, so when IBM decided to go for TCP/IP we followed even though things were really slow. For example, Belgacom was not interested in running the Domain Name System so we did it here, for some time, starting in 1993 with Pierre Verbaten (https://www.dnsbelgium.be/en/history). Belgacom were focused on X25 (DCS - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X.25) so they missed it.\n\nIt was like the french Minitel ? \nWell, at that time we were really jealous about Minitel. Could you imagine that? Terminals?  At home ? You could work home with a computer ! You could send emails ! All in one, a pc computer with a modem ! \n\nHow did the research about software evolved in the department?\nI am mainly talking about network research but here there were people working on numerical analysis, computing, artificial intelligence ... I was just not involved in those research so i don't know much about it \n\nYou were focused on software and network..\nYes, we did produce some software. We did make software to generate compilers, there was some A.I. software in Prolog, numerical analysis  libraries... Some were sold or shared, it depends.  \nWe did sell some software since the beginning i think when it was not even a department but a professor and a couple of students.\n\nIs it when you joined ? \nNo it was already a department. I did study dutch industrial engeneering in electronics. At the time in electronics you did hear something about computers, i was interested in it i wanted to know more. I heard they had\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","attribs":"|1+g*6|2+2*5+3p*6|1+1*5+4f*6|2+2+dm*6|2+2+4n*6|1+1|1+1*5+11*6|2+2+bc*6|2+2+5z*2+3e*3+1*4*3+20*4+1*6|2+2+e7*6|2+2+7n*6|2+2*5+1a*6|2+2+53*6|2+2*5+19*6|2+2+c7*6|2+2*5+1r*6|2+2+jo*6|1+1+41*6|2+2*5+1a*6|2+2+5g*6|2+2*5+2w*6|2+2+l6*6|2+2*5+1f*6|2+2+8f*5+7+kh*6|1+1+uu*0|1+1+9s*0|2+2*5+1v*0|1+1+aj*0|2+2*5+5m*0|1+1+30*0|1+1+48*2+15+9l*0|1+1+1*0|1+1+1*5+1y*0|1+1+tm*0|1+1+1*0|1+1*5+4t*0|1+1+dr*0|1+1+u6*0|2+2*5+x*0|1+1+5q*0|2+2*5+1q*0|1+1+5w*0|2+2*5+16*0|1+1+5b*0|1+1+3l*0|2+2*0*5+o*0|4+66*6|5+5|1+1"}}},"pad:observatory.guide.jeanhuensitvextended:revs:4501":{"changeset":"Z:a94>2|20=a2t=62*0+2$

At the time computers were mainframes and you did fed them with programms by punch cards. Programing was writing down the program, than you punched it and the next day you get results, mostly error. That's the way it worked at that time. To teach us programing, they used the langage of that time, Fortran and some kind of invented assembly langage, it didn't really exist, it was simplified.\n\nMost of the time you did write down your program, the teacher and the assistant would have to tell you what is wrong or good, you didn't had much practical experience.\n\n**How was it like, tons of pages ?** \n\nNo. As an anecdocte, i remember punchcards were a block of papers, we were jealous of the people who came in the computer center with huge stacks of cards. That were really small programs, not complicated one. The fact you had to learn to use the computer from scratch, everything was new, you couldn't rely on previous experiences, everything was new. And to start with small programs was difficult enough. \n\nThat was also the time when Edsger W. Dijkstra who forked the goto... i still remember him, in an audience, giving us a lecture on modernisation in programming at the International computing symposium 1977 in Liège (programming: from craft to scientific discipline https://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/EWD/transcriptions/EWD05xx/EWD566.html). He told usxx (i'll complete it as soon as possible. i need Jean's input)\"\n\nAnd then from 75 on, computers became cheaper and could be bought by departments and smaller entities. And than came the first interactive computer. Still beasts about two cubic meters, costing two millions belgian francs. But it was low enough to allow people to type in directly commands. I started working here in 75 as a researcher, it have evolved continuously and i saw computer getting cheaper and getting easier to use.The way to use it was simplified, you could start to go to the beast and try it out.\n\nI remember more or less: you did write down the program in Fortran for instance… We always thought in the beginning that it would work and it didn't, so after a turn around you were giving it back to the operator and you have to wait half a day or a night to get the results.\n\n**What kind of program you were working on?** \n\nI remember the first program i had to write was you got three numbers, you had to make the program decide if you construct a triangle with the numbers being the sides of the triangle.\n\n**That took an afternoon to be processed ?** \n\nWell, yeah. You had to imagine how to do it which was also one problem, than you prepare the card with the punching machine and you give the package of cards to the operator who was feeeding the computer with the cards. People had the taks to fed the computers by hands, with paper, cards, than disks and it lasts onto the magnetic disks period. And after a number of hours or a night you get a listing, a piece of paper, with the results.\n\n**When where you able to record the program onto the machine?**\n\nI think that happens between 75 and 80. After the punching cards which was already a way to record the program, we had  typewriters, terminals but we could record the programs, we could store them on the computer. We had magnetic discs. IBM had number for everything, i remember the 33-30 [manufactured from 1970 on] had a magnetic disk. We didn't touch the machines, operators would change the disks, we could only access the typewriter. That was our most direct connexion to the computer. Thetimes were diffent. The mainframes were such huge costly beasts that it had operators day and night keeping it busy. Even at night there were two or three guys mounting tapes, dismounting tapes, that kind of stuff.\nhttps://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/42/IBM_magnetic_disk_drives_3330%2B3333.png/600px-IBM_magnetic_disk_drives_3330%2B3333.png\n\n**When did you stop working with operators?** \n\nSomewhere between 85 and 90. There were still operators at the main computer of the university, but there were also small computers, so researchers and student can have direct access when needed. \n\n**When did you start to work with software sold by others or gived away in order to do your research?** \n\nYou stil need an operating system on the mainframe that was delivered by IBM or the constructor delivering the mainframe. When you bought mini-computers, which were the  smaller versions of mainframes, in most cases you did buy an operating systems, compilers and all the stuff you need to be able to program those things. In most cases, because the computer sciences department did buy the mini-computer from, for instance *digital equipment corporation*,  a manufactorer of that time, but they didn't buy their software. They were not open source or free,  but you could get Unix and could run it on those digital equipment (DEC) computers. That is what the computer department of the University of Louvain la Neuve *l'unité d'informatique*, did and so did we.\n\n**When did you start working with unix as an os?** \n\nI took a trip to Amsterdam, it must have been in 1979/80… Well, the story starts in our french sister university (LLN) where they did have a PDP-11 with Unix on it https://hackadaycom.files.wordpress.com/2016/08/full-size-pdp11.jpg. You got Unix, at the time, when you were a university, from Bell Aps (Ma Bell), the american telephone company. It was a mega organisation at the time [before the [dismantlment of AT&T/Bell system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breakup_of_the_Bell_System)].Due to monopoly, the US authorities splitted up in different Baby Bells. One of the restriction was there was a research baby bell, they couldn't really sell anything.There were computer scientists there, who did developped some Unix interesting things.  For universities you did get the source and no support for free. How to install it, no idea. In Unité d'informatique, they were lucky: they got the same computer that unix were developped on.  They got the disk by snail mail as a post-office package. They mounted it and it did spin up and they had it.\nHere, we did have a cheaper PDP11 (DEC - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PDP-11) We go the disk source from Bell Aps but we could not run it. We could look at it but that was all, because our disc format was different than the one at Bell Aps. Somebody here did write a driver for that disk and we did compiled it in l'unité d'informatique of LLN.  it did compile it but we couldn't try it because we did not have So we find the nearest Unix system compatiblewith ours, it was in Amsterdam.  Andrew Tenebaum who did write since then a number of books about operating systems and became quite an authority. He was working there. It was the young Tanenbaum, just arriving from United States to Amsterdam. He was learning to speak dutch. We did understood his english better but his assistant insisted that he speaks dutch because he will have to pass an exam in dutch. There we got a disk, than also the one with the driver we compiled, than we got here and we start using Unix.  Than in my opinion the start of open source was Unix because we had to maintain it by ourselves and we learned a lot from the sources.\nIn that time we did had to get software and it brings us to different places. For example, at the time the agents at the custom at the airport or post didn't know what to do with the discs in terms of custom clearance. They used magnetic or xrays, we had to write on the package that it should not be x-rayed. But we got time to time unreadable discs. \n\n**So it took like weeks between the transportation, the custom...**\nYes, the custom had to clear the packages. I remember i've been in the customs in Zaventem. I had received a letter that my package from Bell Aps had arrived. I went there thinking i would have to pay something and go. But no. It had to be cleared so there wa some organisation that had to do administrative stuff, so i only got it a few days later. The response time was huge :)\n\n**Than after that period of time how did you switch from that kind of collaboration on how to make software and make software work to collaboration on networks, between universities and researchers...**\nIn the Unix system of that time there was a kind of networking protocol which only did work on serial lines.\n You could connect two unix systems together you only need a line. We had one between LLN and Leuven, it's only 15 kms, but we had to ask Belgacom, than La Régie des télégraphes et téléphones, to get a modem to connect through their network and than over that modem you could reach an amazing speed of 300 characters per second. And that was the first communication. It did happened somewhere around 85. And then you had connexion with another computer, writing something here and do  something. And we could send programs to each other. \n \n **What was the first thing you did send through a network like this?**\n I didn't do it myself, i remember it was a kind of chat program. And on LLN side was Elie Milgrom, he is retired now. On this side, it was Pr Willems. And i remember that they typed something and they got a response from the other side and that was it.  But i remember that Pr Willems sent \"ok we stop now\". And that Elie Milgrom answered \"See you later, Alligator\" [a reference to Bill Haley and the Comets].  At the time we still had these kind of songs in mind. (lol). Those Unix to Unix connexions were first. And there was a worldwide Unix to Unix based network, Usenet (1979), it still exists somewhere... you can download load  of illegal movies and that stuff, that was not what we meant at the time. But that is what is left. And Usenet became gradually replaced by the Internet in USA. In Europe, the Internet came a lot later, but we had access to the Internet, we could send mail to them and we could receive mail from them, because some friendly american university, later companies, did translate internet mail to UCP mail. That was before the 1990's.\n \n **Your relation to software had changed at the time because you did not have to do all this manipulations with the software your received... Was it already floppy discs ?**\n No, magnetic tapes, for the mainframe at least. Most of the mini-computers had some cheaper magnetic tapes. Between 90 and 95 the main machines for the software institute was a VAX from DEC. Once a year the software came from Berkeley, it was still Unix but modified by Berkeley for virtual memory and all the stuff which are common now. We received a tape, with lot of goodies, i still remember we didn't know what was on there but we scrutinised there to know what was there, what we can use.\nIn Europe, companies like Siemens were trying to set up software centers to make software avaiable, they were even trying to set up networks. Researchers did love the Internet, it worked, it was useful for their researchs. So companies in Europe, were trying to set up their own networks, i remember for example the X/OPEN transport protocol. Their was a lot of standards about what software layers should do, but it didn't succeed because sometime, 92 maybe, IBM decided to quit their own private network and to go forTCP/IP and was the switching point. Everything done for X/OPEN were suddently forgotten. For the mainframes, and certainly in Belgium computing was mainly mainframes, i'm talking about universities here, so when IBM decided to go for TCP/IP we followed even though things were really slow. For example, Belgacom was not interested in running the Domain Name System so we did it here, for some time, starting in 1993 with Pierre Verbaten (https://www.dnsbelgium.be/en/history). Belgacom were focused on X25 (DCS - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X.25) so they missed it.\n\nIt was like the french Minitel ? \nWell, at that time we were really jealous about Minitel. Could you imagine that? Terminals?  At home ? You could work home with a computer ! You could send emails ! All in one, a pc computer with a modem ! \n\nHow did the research about software evolved in the department?\nI am mainly talking about network research but here there were people working on numerical analysis, computing, artificial intelligence ... I was just not involved in those research so i don't know much about it \n\nYou were focused on software and network..\nYes, we did produce some software. We did make software to generate compilers, there was some A.I. software in Prolog, numerical analysis  libraries... Some were sold or shared, it depends.  \nWe did sell some software since the beginning i think when it was not even a department but a professor and a couple of students.\n\nIs it when you joined ? \nNo it was already a department. I did study dutch industrial engeneering in electronics. At the time in electronics you did hear something about computers, i was interested in it i wanted to know more. I heard they had started a year before a degree in computer engeneering. It was the first year where industrial engineer could join. The only thing we knew about computer were in movies. I wanted to know

the joy of assisting during the TGSO.**\n**I heard that that until recently, let's say the late 1990's, when learning computer programming you had to start by  writing down the program on paper... ** \n\nIn 1973, i did study computer sciences, it was the second year of the department, here in Leuven. At the time computers were mainframes and you did fed them with programms by punch cards. Programing was writing down the program, than you punched it and the next day you get results, mostly error. That's the way it worked at that time. To teach us programing, they used the langage of that time, Fortran and some kind of invented assembly langage, it didn't really exist, it was simplified.\n\nMost of the time you did write down your program, the teacher and the assistant would have to tell you what is wrong or good, you didn't had much practical experience.\n\n**How was it like, tons of pages ?** \n\nNo. As an anecdocte, i remember punchcards were a block of papers, we were jealous of the people who came in the computer center with huge stacks of cards. That were really small programs, not complicated one. The fact you had to learn to use the computer from scratch, everything was new, you couldn't rely on previous experiences, everything was new. And to start with small programs was difficult enough. \n\nThat was also the time when Edsger W. Dijkstra who forked the goto... i still remember him, in an audience, giving us a lecture on modernisation in programming at the International computing symposium 1977 in Liège (programming: from craft to scientific discipline https://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/EWD/transcriptions/EWD05xx/EWD566.html). He told usxx (i'll complete it as soon as possible. i need Jean's input)\"\n\nAnd then from 75 on, computers became cheaper and could be bought by departments and smaller entities. And than came the first interactive computer. Still beasts about two cubic meters, costing two millions belgian francs. But it was low enough to allow people to type in directly commands. I started working here in 75 as a researcher, it have evolved continuously and i saw computer getting cheaper and getting easier to use.The way to use it was simplified, you could start to go to the beast and try it out.\n\nI remember more or less: you did write down the program in Fortran for instance… We always thought in the beginning that it would work and it didn't, so after a turn around you were giving it back to the operator and you have to wait half a day or a night to get the results.\n\n**What kind of program you were working on?** \n\nI remember the first program i had to write was you got three numbers, you had to make the program decide if you construct a triangle with the numbers being the sides of the triangle.\n\n**That took an afternoon to be processed ?** \n\nWell, yeah. You had to imagine how to do it which was also one problem, than you prepare the card with the punching machine and you give the package of cards to the operator who was feeeding the computer with the cards. People had the taks to fed the computers by hands, with paper, cards, than disks and it lasts onto the magnetic disks period. And after a number of hours or a night you get a listing, a piece of paper, with the results.\n\n**When where you able to record the program onto the machine?**\n\nI think that happens between 75 and 80. After the punching cards which was already a way to record the program, we had  typewriters, terminals but we could record the programs, we could store them on the computer. We had magnetic discs. IBM had number for everything, i remember the 33-30 [manufactured from 1970 on] had a magnetic disk. We didn't touch the machines, operators would change the disks, we could only access the typewriter. That was our most direct connexion to the computer. Thetimes were diffent. The mainframes were such huge costly beasts that it had operators day and night keeping it busy. Even at night there were two or three guys mounting tapes, dismounting tapes, that kind of stuff.\nhttps://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/42/IBM_magnetic_disk_drives_3330%2B3333.png/600px-IBM_magnetic_disk_drives_3330%2B3333.png\n\n**When did you stop working with operators?** \n\nSomewhere between 85 and 90. There were still operators at the main computer of the university, but there were also small computers, so researchers and student can have direct access when needed. \n\n**When did you start to work with software sold by others or gived away in order to do your research?** \n\nYou stil need an operating system on the mainframe that was delivered by IBM or the constructor delivering the mainframe. When you bought mini-computers, which were the  smaller versions of mainframes, in most cases you did buy an operating systems, compilers and all the stuff you need to be able to program those things. In most cases, because the computer sciences department did buy the mini-computer from, for instance *digital equipment corporation*,  a manufactorer of that time, but they didn't buy their software. They were not open source or free,  but you could get Unix and could run it on those digital equipment (DEC) computers. That is what the computer department of the University of Louvain la Neuve *l'unité d'informatique*, did and so did we.\n\n**When did you start working with unix as an os?** \n\nI took a trip to Amsterdam, it must have been in 1979/80… Well, the story starts in our french sister university (LLN) where they did have a PDP-11 with Unix on it https://hackadaycom.files.wordpress.com/2016/08/full-size-pdp11.jpg. You got Unix, at the time, when you were a university, from Bell Aps (Ma Bell), the american telephone company. It was a mega organisation at the time [before the [dismantlment of AT&T/Bell system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breakup_of_the_Bell_System)].Due to monopoly, the US authorities splitted up in different Baby Bells. One of the restriction was there was a research baby bell, they couldn't really sell anything.There were computer scientists there, who did developped some Unix interesting things.  For universities you did get the source and no support for free. How to install it, no idea. In Unité d'informatique, they were lucky: they got the same computer that unix were developped on.  They got the disk by snail mail as a post-office package. They mounted it and it did spin up and they had it.\nHere, we did have a cheaper PDP11 (DEC - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PDP-11) We go the disk source from Bell Aps but we could not run it. We could look at it but that was all, because our disc format was different than the one at Bell Aps. Somebody here did write a driver for that disk and we did compiled it in l'unité d'informatique of LLN.  it did compile it but we couldn't try it because we did not have So we find the nearest Unix system compatiblewith ours, it was in Amsterdam.  Andrew Tenebaum who did write since then a number of books about operating systems and became quite an authority. He was working there. It was the young Tanenbaum, just arriving from United States to Amsterdam. He was learning to speak dutch. We did understood his english better but his assistant insisted that he speaks dutch because he will have to pass an exam in dutch. There we got a disk, than also the one with the driver we compiled, than we got here and we start using Unix.  Than in my opinion the start of open source was Unix because we had to maintain it by ourselves and we learned a lot from the sources.\nIn that time we did had to get software and it brings us to different places. For example, at the time the agents at the custom at the airport or post didn't know what to do with the discs in terms of custom clearance. They used magnetic or xrays, we had to write on the package that it should not be x-rayed. But we got time to time unreadable discs. \n\n**So it took like weeks between the transportation, the custom...**\nYes, the custom had to clear the packages. I remember i've been in the customs in Zaventem. I had received a letter that my package from Bell Aps had arrived. I went there thinking i would have to pay something and go. But no. It had to be cleared so there wa some organisation that had to do administrative stuff, so i only got it a few days later. The response time was huge :)\n\n**Than after that period of time how did you switch from that kind of collaboration on how to make software and make software work to collaboration on networks, between universities and researchers...**\nIn the Unix system of that time there was a kind of networking protocol which only did work on serial lines.\n You could connect two unix systems together you only need a line. We had one between LLN and Leuven, it's only 15 kms, but we had to ask Belgacom, than La Régie des télégraphes et téléphones, to get a modem to connect through their network and than over that modem you could reach an amazing speed of 300 characters per second. And that was the first communication. It did happened somewhere around 85. And then you had connexion with another computer, writing something here and do  something. And we could send programs to each other. \n \n **What was the first thing you did send through a network like this?**\n I didn't do it myself, i remember it was a kind of chat program. And on LLN side was Elie Milgrom, he is retired now. On this side, it was Pr Willems. And i remember that they typed something and they got a response from the other side and that was it.  But i remember that Pr Willems sent \"ok we stop now\". And that Elie Milgrom answered \"See you later, Alligator\" [a reference to Bill Haley and the Comets].  At the time we still had these kind of songs in mind. (lol). Those Unix to Unix connexions were first. And there was a worldwide Unix to Unix based network, Usenet (1979), it still exists somewhere... you can download load  of illegal movies and that stuff, that was not what we meant at the time. But that is what is left. And Usenet became gradually replaced by the Internet in USA. In Europe, the Internet came a lot later, but we had access to the Internet, we could send mail to them and we could receive mail from them, because some friendly american university, later companies, did translate internet mail to UCP mail. That was before the 1990's.\n \n **Your relation to software had changed at the time because you did not have to do all this manipulations with the software your received... Was it already floppy discs ?**\n No, magnetic tapes, for the mainframe at least. Most of the mini-computers had some cheaper magnetic tapes. Between 90 and 95 the main machines for the software institute was a VAX from DEC. Once a year the software came from Berkeley, it was still Unix but modified by Berkeley for virtual memory and all the stuff which are common now. We received a tape, with lot of goodies, i still remember we didn't know what was on there but we scrutinised there to know what was there, what we can use.\nIn Europe, companies like Siemens were trying to set up software centers to make software avaiable, they were even trying to set up networks. Researchers did love the Internet, it worked, it was useful for their researchs. So companies in Europe, were trying to set up their own networks, i remember for example the X/OPEN transport protocol. Their was a lot of standards about what software layers should do, but it didn't succeed because sometime, 92 maybe, IBM decided to quit their own private network and to go forTCP/IP and was the switching point. Everything done for X/OPEN were suddently forgotten. For the mainframes, and certainly in Belgium computing was mainly mainframes, i'm talking about universities here, so when IBM decided to go for TCP/IP we followed even though things were really slow. For example, Belgacom was not interested in running the Domain Name System so we did it here, for some time, starting in 1993 with Pierre Verbaten (https://www.dnsbelgium.be/en/history). Belgacom were focused on X25 (DCS - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X.25) so they missed it.\n\nIt was like the french Minitel ? \nWell, at that time we were really jealous about Minitel. Could you imagine that? Terminals?  At home ? You could work home with a computer ! You could send emails ! All in one, a pc computer with a modem ! \n\nHow did the research about software evolved in the department?\nI am mainly talking about network research but here there were people working on numerical analysis, computing, artificial intelligence ... I was just not involved in those research so i don't know much about it \n\nYou were focused on software and network..\nYes, we did produce some software. We did make software to generate compilers, there was some A.I. software in Prolog, numerical analysis  libraries... Some were sold or shared, it depends.  \nWe did sell some software since the beginning i think when it was not even a department but a professor and a couple of students.\n\nIs it when you joined ? \nNo it was already a department. I did study dutch industrial engeneering in electronics. At the time in electronics you did hear something about computers, i was interested in it i wanted to know more. I heard they had started a year before a degree in computer engeneering. It was the first year where industrial engineer could join. The only thing we knew about computer were in movies. I wanted to know how it work. I'm not sure i still know now even if maybe i have some ideas...\n\nHow many langage do you know ?\nAssembly, FORTRAN, PL-1 the langage invented by IBM to be, \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","attribs":"|1+g*6|2+2*5+3p*6|1+1*5+4f*6|2+2+dm*6|2+2+4n*6|1+1|1+1*5+11*6|2+2+bc*6|2+2+5z*2+3e*3+1*4*3+20*4+1*6|2+2+e7*6|2+2+7n*6|2+2*5+1a*6|2+2+53*6|2+2*5+19*6|2+2+c7*6|2+2*5+1r*6|2+2+jo*6|1+1+41*6|2+2*5+1a*6|2+2+5g*6|2+2*5+2w*6|2+2+l6*6|2+2*5+1f*6|2+2+8f*5+7+kh*6|1+1+uu*0|1+1+9s*0|2+2*5+1v*0|1+1+aj*0|2+2*5+5m*0|1+1+30*0|1+1+48*2+15+9l*0|1+1+1*0|1+1+1*5+1y*0|1+1+tm*0|1+1+1*0|1+1*5+4t*0|1+1+dr*0|1+1+u6*0|2+2*5+x*0|1+1+5q*0|2+2*5+1q*0|1+1+5w*0|2+2*5+16*0|1+1+5b*0|1+1+3l*0|2+2*5+o*0|1+1+9a*0|6+6s*6|5+5|1+1"}}},"pad:observatory.guide.jeanhuensitvextended:revs:4701":{"changeset":"Z:aj1>2|23=ah5=1l*0+2$ t","meta":{"author":"a.kqv62Q3nhchdwIuK","timestamp":1518098474229}},"pad:observatory.guide.jeanhuensitvextended:revs:4702":{"changeset":"Z:aj3>4|23=ah5=1n*0+4$he u","meta":{"author":"a.kqv62Q3nhchdwIuK","timestamp":1518098474729}},"pad:observatory.guide.jeanhuensitvextended:revs:4703":{"changeset":"Z:aj7>1|23=ah5=1r*0+1$n","meta":{"author":"a.kqv62Q3nhchdwIuK","timestamp":1518098475229}},"pad:observatory.guide.jeanhuensitvextended:revs:4704":{"changeset":"Z:aj8>3|23=ah5=1s*0+3$ive","meta":{"author":"a.kqv62Q3nhchdwIuK","timestamp":1518098475730}},"pad:observatory.guide.jeanhuensitvextended:revs:4705":{"changeset":"Z:ajb>1|23=ah5=1v*0+1$r","meta":{"author":"a.kqv62Q3nhchdwIuK","timestamp":1518098476244}},"pad:observatory.guide.jeanhuensitvextended:revs:4706":{"changeset":"Z:ajc>4|23=ah5=1w*0+4$sal ","meta":{"author":"a.kqv62Q3nhchdwIuK","timestamp":1518098476764}},"pad:observatory.guide.jeanhuensitvextended:revs:4707":{"changeset":"Z:ajg>1|23=ah5=20*0+1$o","meta":{"author":"a.kqv62Q3nhchdwIuK","timestamp":1518098477264}},"pad:observatory.guide.jeanhuensitvextended:revs:4708":{"changeset":"Z:ajh>2|23=ah5=21*0+2$ne","meta":{"author":"a.kqv62Q3nhchdwIuK","timestamp":1518098477763}},"pad:observatory.guide.jeanhuensitvextended:revs:4709":{"changeset":"Z:ajj>1|23=ah5=25*0+1$C","meta":{"author":"a.kqv62Q3nhchdwIuK","timestamp":1518098482618}},"pad:observatory.guide.jeanhuensitvextended:revs:471":{"changeset":"Z:55l<1|u=2ms=9d-1$","meta":{"author":"a.kqv62Q3nhchdwIuK","timestamp":1518088900055}},"pad:observatory.guide.jeanhuensitvextended:revs:4710":{"changeset":"Z:ajk>1|23=ah5=26*0+1$,","meta":{"author":"a.kqv62Q3nhchdwIuK","timestamp":1518098483118}},"pad:observatory.guide.jeanhuensitvextended:revs:4711":{"changeset":"Z:ajl>1|23=ah5=27*0+1$ ","meta":{"author":"a.kqv62Q3nhchdwIuK","timestamp":1518098483620}},"pad:observatory.guide.jeanhuensitvextended:revs:4712":{"changeset":"Z:ajm>1|23=ah5=28*0+1$C","meta":{"author":"a.kqv62Q3nhchdwIuK","timestamp":1518098487212}},"pad:observatory.guide.jeanhuensitvextended:revs:4713":{"changeset":"Z:ajn>1|23=ah5=29*0+1$o","meta":{"author":"a.kqv62Q3nhchdwIuK","timestamp":1518098487712}},"pad:observatory.guide.jeanhuensitvextended:revs:4714":{"changeset":"Z:ajo>1|23=ah5=2a*0+1$n","meta":{"author":"a.kqv62Q3nhchdwIuK","timestamp":1518098488213}},"pad:observatory.guide.jeanhuensitvextended:revs:4715":{"changeset":"Z:ajp<1|23=ah5=2a-1$","meta":{"author":"a.kqv62Q3nhchdwIuK","timestamp":1518098488712}},"pad:observatory.guide.jeanhuensitvextended:revs:4716":{"changeset":"Z:ajo>1|23=ah5=2a*0+1$b","meta":{"author":"a.kqv62Q3nhchdwIuK","timestamp":1518098489212}},"pad:observatory.guide.jeanhuensitvextended:revs:4717":{"changeset":"Z:ajp>3|23=ah5=2b*0+3$ol,","meta":{"author":"a.kqv62Q3nhchdwIuK","timestamp":1518098489713}},"pad:observatory.guide.jeanhuensitvextended:revs:4718":{"changeset":"Z:ajs>1|23=ah5=2e*0+1$ ","meta":{"author":"a.kqv62Q3nhchdwIuK","timestamp":1518098490214}},"pad:observatory.guide.jeanhuensitvextended:revs:4719":{"changeset":"Z:ajt>0|22=aga*5=u$","meta":{"author":"a.kqv62Q3nhchdwIuK","timestamp":1518098493247}},"pad:observatory.guide.jeanhuensitvextended:revs:472":{"changeset":"Z:55k<1|u=2ms=9c-1$","meta":{"author":"a.kqv62Q3nhchdwIuK","timestamp":1518088900563}},"pad:observatory.guide.jeanhuensitvextended:revs:4720":{"changeset":"Z:ajt>1|23=ah5=2f*0+1$i","meta":{"author":"a.kqv62Q3nhchdwIuK","timestamp":1518098495214}},"pad:observatory.guide.jeanhuensitvextended:revs:4721":{"changeset":"Z:aju>2|23=ah5=2g*0+2$d ","meta":{"author":"a.kqv62Q3nhchdwIuK","timestamp":1518098495714}},"pad:observatory.guide.jeanhuensitvextended:revs:4722":{"changeset":"Z:ajw<1|23=ah5=2h-1$","meta":{"author":"a.kqv62Q3nhchdwIuK","timestamp":1518098496219}},"pad:observatory.guide.jeanhuensitvextended:revs:4723":{"changeset":"Z:ajv<2|23=ah5=2f-2$","meta":{"author":"a.kqv62Q3nhchdwIuK","timestamp":1518098496720}},"pad:observatory.guide.jeanhuensitvextended:revs:4724":{"changeset":"Z:ajt<2|23=ah5=2d-2$","meta":{"author":"a.kqv62Q3nhchdwIuK","timestamp":1518098497218}},"pad:observatory.guide.jeanhuensitvextended:revs:4725":{"changeset":"Z:ajr>2|23=ah5=2d*0+2$.

__NOPUBLISH__\n\n\n**You have been using computers since a long time, as you explained us during the tour we had the joy of assisting during the TGSO.**\n**I heard that that until recently, let's say the late 1990's, when learning computer programming you had to start by  writing down the program on paper... ** \n\nIn 1973, i did study computer sciences, it was the second year of the department, here in Leuven. At the time computers were mainframes and you did fed them with programms by punch cards. Programing was writing down the program, than you punched it and the next day you get results, mostly error. That's the way it worked at that time. To teach us programing, they used the langage of that time, Fortran and some kind of invented assembly langage, it didn't really exist, it was simplified.\n\nMost of the time you did write down your program, the teacher and the assistant would have to tell you what is wrong or good, you didn't had much practical experience.\n\n**How was it like, tons of pages ?** \n\nNo. As an anecdocte, i remember punchcards were a block of papers, we were jealous of the people who came in the computer center with huge stacks of cards. That were really small programs, not complicated one. The fact you had to learn to use the computer from scratch, everything was new, you couldn't rely on previous experiences, everything was new. And to start with small programs was difficult enough. \n\nThat was also the time when Edsger W. Dijkstra who forked the goto... i still remember him, in an audience, giving us a lecture on modernisation in programming at the International computing symposium 1977 in Liège (programming: from craft to scientific discipline https://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/EWD/transcriptions/EWD05xx/EWD566.html). He told usxx (i'll complete it as soon as possible. i need Jean's input)\"\n\nAnd then from 75 on, computers became cheaper and could be bought by departments and smaller entities. And than came the first interactive computer. Still beasts about two cubic meters, costing two millions belgian francs. But it was low enough to allow people to type in directly commands. I started working here in 75 as a researcher, it have evolved continuously and i saw computer getting cheaper and getting easier to use.The way to use it was simplified, you could start to go to the beast and try it out.\n\nI remember more or less: you did write down the program in Fortran for instance… We always thought in the beginning that it would work and it didn't, so after a turn around you were giving it back to the operator and you have to wait half a day or a night to get the results.\n\n**What kind of program you were working on?** \n\nI remember the first program i had to write was you got three numbers, you had to make the program decide if you construct a triangle with the numbers being the sides of the triangle.\n\n**That took an afternoon to be processed ?** \n\nWell, yeah. You had to imagine how to do it which was also one problem, than you prepare the card with the punching machine and you give the package of cards to the operator who was feeeding the computer with the cards. People had the taks to fed the computers by hands, with paper, cards, than disks and it lasts onto the magnetic disks period. And after a number of hours or a night you get a listing, a piece of paper, with the results.\n\n**When where you able to record the program onto the machine?**\n\nI think that happens between 75 and 80. After the punching cards which was already a way to record the program, we had  typewriters, terminals but we could record the programs, we could store them on the computer. We had magnetic discs. IBM had number for everything, i remember the 33-30 [manufactured from 1970 on] had a magnetic disk. We didn't touch the machines, operators would change the disks, we could only access the typewriter. That was our most direct connexion to the computer. Thetimes were diffent. The mainframes were such huge costly beasts that it had operators day and night keeping it busy. Even at night there were two or three guys mounting tapes, dismounting tapes, that kind of stuff.\nhttps://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/42/IBM_magnetic_disk_drives_3330%2B3333.png/600px-IBM_magnetic_disk_drives_3330%2B3333.png\n\n**When did you stop working with operators?** \n\nSomewhere between 85 and 90. There were still operators at the main computer of the university, but there were also small computers, so researchers and student can have direct access when needed. \n\n**When did you start to work with software sold by others or gived away in order to do your research?** \n\nYou stil need an operating system on the mainframe that was delivered by IBM or the constructor delivering the mainframe. When you bought mini-computers, which were the  smaller versions of mainframes, in most cases you did buy an operating systems, compilers and all the stuff you need to be able to program those things. In most cases, because the computer sciences department did buy the mini-computer from, for instance *digital equipment corporation*,  a manufactorer of that time, but they didn't buy their software. They were not open source or free,  but you could get Unix and could run it on those digital equipment (DEC) computers. That is what the computer department of the University of Louvain la Neuve *l'unité d'informatique*, did and so did we.\n\n**When did you start working with unix as an os?** \n\nI took a trip to Amsterdam, it must have been in 1979/80… Well, the story starts in our french sister university (LLN) where they did have a PDP-11 with Unix on it https://hackadaycom.files.wordpress.com/2016/08/full-size-pdp11.jpg. You got Unix, at the time, when you were a university, from Bell Aps (Ma Bell), the american telephone company. It was a mega organisation at the time [before the [dismantlment of AT&T/Bell system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breakup_of_the_Bell_System)].Due to monopoly, the US authorities splitted up in different Baby Bells. One of the restriction was there was a research baby bell, they couldn't really sell anything.There were computer scientists there, who did developped some Unix interesting things.  For universities you did get the source and no support for free. How to install it, no idea. In Unité d'informatique, they were lucky: they got the same computer that unix were developped on.  They got the disk by snail mail as a post-office package. They mounted it and it did spin up and they had it.\nHere, we did have a cheaper PDP11 (DEC - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PDP-11) We go the disk source from Bell Aps but we could not run it. We could look at it but that was all, because our disc format was different than the one at Bell Aps. Somebody here did write a driver for that disk and we did compiled it in l'unité d'informatique of LLN.  it did compile it but we couldn't try it because we did not have So we find the nearest Unix system compatiblewith ours, it was in Amsterdam.  Andrew Tenebaum who did write since then a number of books about operating systems and became quite an authority. He was working there. It was the young Tanenbaum, just arriving from United States to Amsterdam. He was learning to speak dutch. We did understood his english better but his assistant insisted that he speaks dutch because he will have to pass an exam in dutch. There we got a disk, than also the one with the driver we compiled, than we got here and we start using Unix.  Than in my opinion the start of open source was Unix because we had to maintain it by ourselves and we learned a lot from the sources.\nIn that time we did had to get software and it brings us to different places. For example, at the time the agents at the custom at the airport or post didn't know what to do with the discs in terms of custom clearance. They used magnetic or xrays, we had to write on the package that it should not be x-rayed. But we got time to time unreadable discs. \n\n**So it took like weeks between the transportation, the custom...**\nYes, the custom had to clear the packages. I remember i've been in the customs in Zaventem. I had received a letter that my package from Bell Aps had arrived. I went there thinking i would have to pay something and go. But no. It had to be cleared so there wa some organisation that had to do administrative stuff, so i only got it a few days later. The response time was huge :)\n\n**Than after that period of time how did you switch from that kind of collaboration on how to make software and make software work to collaboration on networks, between universities and researchers...**\nIn the Unix system of that time there was a kind of networking protocol which only did work on serial lines.\n You could connect two unix systems together you only need a line. We had one between LLN and Leuven, it's only 15 kms, but we had to ask Belgacom, than La Régie des télégraphes et téléphones, to get a modem to connect through their network and than over that modem you could reach an amazing speed of 300 characters per second. And that was the first communication. It did happened somewhere around 85. And then you had connexion with another computer, writing something here and do  something. And we could send programs to each other. \n \n **What was the first thing you did send through a network like this?**\n I didn't do it myself, i remember it was a kind of chat program. And on LLN side was Elie Milgrom, he is retired now. On this side, it was Pr Willems. And i remember that they typed something and they got a response from the other side and that was it.  But i remember that Pr Willems sent \"ok we stop now\". And that Elie Milgrom answered \"See you later, Alligator\" [a reference to Bill Haley and the Comets].  At the time we still had these kind of songs in mind. (lol). Those Unix to Unix connexions were first. And there was a worldwide Unix to Unix based network, Usenet (1979), it still exists somewhere... you can download load  of illegal movies and that stuff, that was not what we meant at the time. But that is what is left. And Usenet became gradually replaced by the Internet in USA. In Europe, the Internet came a lot later, but we had access to the Internet, we could send mail to them and we could receive mail from them, because some friendly american university, later companies, did translate internet mail to UCP mail. That was before the 1990's.\n \n **Your relation to software had changed at the time because you did not have to do all this manipulations with the software your received... Was it already floppy discs ?**\n No, magnetic tapes, for the mainframe at least. Most of the mini-computers had some cheaper magnetic tapes. Between 90 and 95 the main machines for the software institute was a VAX from DEC. Once a year the software came from Berkeley, it was still Unix but modified by Berkeley for virtual memory and all the stuff which are common now. We received a tape, with lot of goodies, i still remember we didn't know what was on there but we scrutinised there to know what was there, what we can use.\nIn Europe, companies like Siemens were trying to set up software centers to make software avaiable, they were even trying to set up networks. Researchers did love the Internet, it worked, it was useful for their researchs. So companies in Europe, were trying to set up their own networks, i remember for example the X/OPEN transport protocol. Their was a lot of standards about what software layers should do, but it didn't succeed because sometime, 92 maybe, IBM decided to quit their own private network and to go forTCP/IP and was the switching point. Everything done for X/OPEN were suddently forgotten. For the mainframes, and certainly in Belgium computing was mainly mainframes, i'm talking about universities here, so when IBM decided to go for TCP/IP we followed even though things were really slow. For example, Belgacom was not interested in running the Domain Name System so we did it here, for some time, starting in 1993 with Pierre Verbaten (https://www.dnsbelgium.be/en/history). Belgacom were focused on X25 (DCS - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X.25) so they missed it.\n\nIt was like the french Minitel ? \nWell, at that time we were really jealous about Minitel. Could you imagine that? Terminals?  At home ? You could work home with a computer ! You could send emails ! All in one, a pc computer with a modem ! \n\nHow did the research about software evolved in the department?\nI am mainly talking about network research but here there were people working on numerical analysis, computing, artificial intelligence ... I was just not involved in those research so i don't know much about it \n\nYou were focused on software and network..\nYes, we did produce some software. We did make software to generate compilers, there was some A.I. software in Prolog, numerical analysis  libraries... Some were sold or shared, it depends.  \nWe did sell some software since the beginning i think when it was not even a department but a professor and a couple of students.\n\nIs it when you joined ? \nNo it was already a department. I did study dutch industrial engeneering in electronics. At the time in electronics you did hear something about computers, i was interested in it i wanted to know more. I heard they had started a year before a degree in computer engeneering. It was the first year where industrial engineer could join. The only thing we knew about computer were in movies. I wanted to know how it work. I'm not sure i still know now even if maybe i have some ideas...\n\nHow many langage do you know ?\nAssembly, FORTRAN, PL-1 the langage invented by IBM to be the universal one, C, Cobol. Perl, i don't know, so more. I'm not fluent in any other langages, but i can read any langage espc\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","attribs":"|1+g*6|2+2*5+3p*6|1+1*5+4f*6|2+2+dm*6|2+2+4n*6|1+1|1+1*5+11*6|2+2+bc*6|2+2+5z*2+3e*3+1*4*3+20*4+1*6|2+2+e7*6|2+2+7n*6|2+2*5+1a*6|2+2+53*6|2+2*5+19*6|2+2+c7*6|2+2*5+1r*6|2+2+jo*6|1+1+41*6|2+2*5+1a*6|2+2+5g*6|2+2*5+2w*6|2+2+l6*6|2+2*5+1f*6|2+2+8f*5+7+kh*6|1+1+uu*0|1+1+9s*0|2+2*5+1v*0|1+1+aj*0|2+2*5+5m*0|1+1+30*0|1+1+48*2+15+9l*0|1+1+1*0|1+1+1*5+1y*0|1+1+tm*0|1+1+1*0|1+1*5+4t*0|1+1+dr*0|1+1+u6*0|2+2*5+x*0|1+1+5q*0|2+2*5+1q*0|1+1+5w*0|2+2*5+16*0|1+1+5b*0|1+1+3l*0|2+2*5+o*0|1+1+9a*0|2+47*0*5+u*0|4+59*6|5+5|1+1"}}},"pad:observatory.guide.jeanhuensitvextended:revs:4801":{"changeset":"Z:amj>1|23=ah5=54-1*0+2$ec","meta":{"author":"a.kqv62Q3nhchdwIuK","timestamp":1518098545347}},"pad:observatory.guide.jeanhuensitvextended:revs:4802":{"changeset":"Z:amk>3|23=ah5=56*0+3$ial","meta":{"author":"a.kqv62Q3nhchdwIuK","timestamp":1518098545848}},"pad:observatory.guide.jeanhuensitvextended:revs:4803":{"changeset":"Z:amn>3|23=ah5=59*0+3$ly

__NOPUBLISH__\n\n\n**You have been using computers since a long time, as you explained us during the tour we had the joy of assisting during the TGSO.**\n**I heard that that until recently, let's say the late 1990's, when learning computer programming you had to start by  writing down the program on paper... ** \n\nIn 1973, i did study computer sciences, it was the second year of the department, here in Leuven. At the time computers were mainframes and you did fed them with programms by punch cards. Programing was writing down the program, than you punched it and the next day you get results, mostly error. That's the way it worked at that time. To teach us programing, they used the langage of that time, Fortran and some kind of invented assembly langage, it didn't really exist, it was simplified.\n\nMost of the time you did write down your program, the teacher and the assistant would have to tell you what is wrong or good, you didn't had much practical experience.\n\n**How was it like, tons of pages ?** \n\nNo. As an anecdocte, i remember punchcards were a block of papers, we were jealous of the people who came in the computer center with huge stacks of cards. That were really small programs, not complicated one. The fact you had to learn to use the computer from scratch, everything was new, you couldn't rely on previous experiences, everything was new. And to start with small programs was difficult enough. \n\nThat was also the time when Edsger W. Dijkstra who forked the goto... i still remember him, in an audience, giving us a lecture on modernisation in programming at the International computing symposium 1977 in Liège (programming: from craft to scientific discipline https://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/EWD/transcriptions/EWD05xx/EWD566.html). He told usxx (i'll complete it as soon as possible. i need Jean's input)\"\n\nAnd then from 75 on, computers became cheaper and could be bought by departments and smaller entities. And than came the first interactive computer. Still beasts about two cubic meters, costing two millions belgian francs. But it was low enough to allow people to type in directly commands. I started working here in 75 as a researcher, it have evolved continuously and i saw computer getting cheaper and getting easier to use.The way to use it was simplified, you could start to go to the beast and try it out.\n\nI remember more or less: you did write down the program in Fortran for instance… We always thought in the beginning that it would work and it didn't, so after a turn around you were giving it back to the operator and you have to wait half a day or a night to get the results.\n\n**What kind of program you were working on?** \n\nI remember the first program i had to write was you got three numbers, you had to make the program decide if you construct a triangle with the numbers being the sides of the triangle.\n\n**That took an afternoon to be processed ?** \n\nWell, yeah. You had to imagine how to do it which was also one problem, than you prepare the card with the punching machine and you give the package of cards to the operator who was feeeding the computer with the cards. People had the taks to fed the computers by hands, with paper, cards, than disks and it lasts onto the magnetic disks period. And after a number of hours or a night you get a listing, a piece of paper, with the results.\n\n**When where you able to record the program onto the machine?**\n\nI think that happens between 75 and 80. After the punching cards which was already a way to record the program, we had  typewriters, terminals but we could record the programs, we could store them on the computer. We had magnetic discs. IBM had number for everything, i remember the 33-30 [manufactured from 1970 on] had a magnetic disk. We didn't touch the machines, operators would change the disks, we could only access the typewriter. That was our most direct connexion to the computer. Thetimes were diffent. The mainframes were such huge costly beasts that it had operators day and night keeping it busy. Even at night there were two or three guys mounting tapes, dismounting tapes, that kind of stuff.\nhttps://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/42/IBM_magnetic_disk_drives_3330%2B3333.png/600px-IBM_magnetic_disk_drives_3330%2B3333.png\n\n**When did you stop working with operators?** \n\nSomewhere between 85 and 90. There were still operators at the main computer of the university, but there were also small computers, so researchers and student can have direct access when needed. \n\n**When did you start to work with software sold by others or gived away in order to do your research?** \n\nYou stil need an operating system on the mainframe that was delivered by IBM or the constructor delivering the mainframe. When you bought mini-computers, which were the  smaller versions of mainframes, in most cases you did buy an operating systems, compilers and all the stuff you need to be able to program those things. In most cases, because the computer sciences department did buy the mini-computer from, for instance *digital equipment corporation*,  a manufactorer of that time, but they didn't buy their software. They were not open source or free,  but you could get Unix and could run it on those digital equipment (DEC) computers. That is what the computer department of the University of Louvain la Neuve *l'unité d'informatique*, did and so did we.\n\n**When did you start working with unix as an os?** \n\nI took a trip to Amsterdam, it must have been in 1979/80… Well, the story starts in our french sister university (LLN) where they did have a PDP-11 with Unix on it https://hackadaycom.files.wordpress.com/2016/08/full-size-pdp11.jpg. You got Unix, at the time, when you were a university, from Bell Aps (Ma Bell), the american telephone company. It was a mega organisation at the time [before the [dismantlment of AT&T/Bell system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breakup_of_the_Bell_System)].Due to monopoly, the US authorities splitted up in different Baby Bells. One of the restriction was there was a research baby bell, they couldn't really sell anything.There were computer scientists there, who did developped some Unix interesting things.  For universities you did get the source and no support for free. How to install it, no idea. In Unité d'informatique, they were lucky: they got the same computer that unix were developped on.  They got the disk by snail mail as a post-office package. They mounted it and it did spin up and they had it.\nHere, we did have a cheaper PDP11 (DEC - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PDP-11) We go the disk source from Bell Aps but we could not run it. We could look at it but that was all, because our disc format was different than the one at Bell Aps. Somebody here did write a driver for that disk and we did compiled it in l'unité d'informatique of LLN.  it did compile it but we couldn't try it because we did not have So we find the nearest Unix system compatiblewith ours, it was in Amsterdam.  Andrew Tenebaum who did write since then a number of books about operating systems and became quite an authority. He was working there. It was the young Tanenbaum, just arriving from United States to Amsterdam. He was learning to speak dutch. We did understood his english better but his assistant insisted that he speaks dutch because he will have to pass an exam in dutch. There we got a disk, than also the one with the driver we compiled, than we got here and we start using Unix.  Than in my opinion the start of open source was Unix because we had to maintain it by ourselves and we learned a lot from the sources.\nIn that time we did had to get software and it brings us to different places. For example, at the time the agents at the custom at the airport or post didn't know what to do with the discs in terms of custom clearance. They used magnetic or xrays, we had to write on the package that it should not be x-rayed. But we got time to time unreadable discs. \n\n**So it took like weeks between the transportation, the custom...**\nYes, the custom had to clear the packages. I remember i've been in the customs in Zaventem. I had received a letter that my package from Bell Aps had arrived. I went there thinking i would have to pay something and go. But no. It had to be cleared so there wa some organisation that had to do administrative stuff, so i only got it a few days later. The response time was huge :)\n\n**Than after that period of time how did you switch from that kind of collaboration on how to make software and make software work to collaboration on networks, between universities and researchers...**\nIn the Unix system of that time there was a kind of networking protocol which only did work on serial lines.\n You could connect two unix systems together you only need a line. We had one between LLN and Leuven, it's only 15 kms, but we had to ask Belgacom, than La Régie des télégraphes et téléphones, to get a modem to connect through their network and than over that modem you could reach an amazing speed of 300 characters per second. And that was the first communication. It did happened somewhere around 85. And then you had connexion with another computer, writing something here and do  something. And we could send programs to each other. \n \n **What was the first thing you did send through a network like this?**\n I didn't do it myself, i remember it was a kind of chat program. And on LLN side was Elie Milgrom, he is retired now. On this side, it was Pr Willems. And i remember that they typed something and they got a response from the other side and that was it.  But i remember that Pr Willems sent \"ok we stop now\". And that Elie Milgrom answered \"See you later, Alligator\" [a reference to Bill Haley and the Comets].  At the time we still had these kind of songs in mind. (lol). Those Unix to Unix connexions were first. And there was a worldwide Unix to Unix based network, Usenet (1979), it still exists somewhere... you can download load  of illegal movies and that stuff, that was not what we meant at the time. But that is what is left. And Usenet became gradually replaced by the Internet in USA. In Europe, the Internet came a lot later, but we had access to the Internet, we could send mail to them and we could receive mail from them, because some friendly american university, later companies, did translate internet mail to UCP mail. That was before the 1990's.\n \n **Your relation to software had changed at the time because you did not have to do all this manipulations with the software your received... Was it already floppy discs ?**\n No, magnetic tapes, for the mainframe at least. Most of the mini-computers had some cheaper magnetic tapes. Between 90 and 95 the main machines for the software institute was a VAX from DEC. Once a year the software came from Berkeley, it was still Unix but modified by Berkeley for virtual memory and all the stuff which are common now. We received a tape, with lot of goodies, i still remember we didn't know what was on there but we scrutinised there to know what was there, what we can use.\nIn Europe, companies like Siemens were trying to set up software centers to make software avaiable, they were even trying to set up networks. Researchers did love the Internet, it worked, it was useful for their researchs. So companies in Europe, were trying to set up their own networks, i remember for example the X/OPEN transport protocol. Their was a lot of standards about what software layers should do, but it didn't succeed because sometime, 92 maybe, IBM decided to quit their own private network and to go forTCP/IP and was the switching point. Everything done for X/OPEN were suddently forgotten. For the mainframes, and certainly in Belgium computing was mainly mainframes, i'm talking about universities here, so when IBM decided to go for TCP/IP we followed even though things were really slow. For example, Belgacom was not interested in running the Domain Name System so we did it here, for some time, starting in 1993 with Pierre Verbaten (https://www.dnsbelgium.be/en/history). Belgacom were focused on X25 (DCS - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X.25) so they missed it.\n\nIt was like the french Minitel ? \nWell, at that time we were really jealous about Minitel. Could you imagine that? Terminals?  At home ? You could work home with a computer ! You could send emails ! All in one, a pc computer with a modem ! \n\nHow did the research about software evolved in the department?\nI am mainly talking about network research but here there were people working on numerical analysis, computing, artificial intelligence ... I was just not involved in those research so i don't know much about it \n\nYou were focused on software and network..\nYes, we did produce some software. We did make software to generate compilers, there was some A.I. software in Prolog, numerical analysis  libraries... Some were sold or shared, it depends.  \nWe did sell some software since the beginning i think when it was not even a department but a professor and a couple of students.\n\nIs it when you joined ? \nNo it was already a department. I did study dutch industrial engeneering in electronics. At the time in electronics you did hear something about computers, i was interested in it i wanted to know more. I heard they had started a year before a degree in computer engeneering. It was the first year where industrial engineer could join. The only thing we knew about computer were in movies. I wanted to know how it work. I'm not sure i still know now even if maybe i have some ideas...\n\nHow many langage do you know ?\nAssembly, FORTRAN, PL-1 the langage invented by IBM to be the universal one, C, Cobol. Perl, i don't know, so more. I'm not fluent in any other langages, but i can read any langage especially well writtened, i know i can understand it and learn it...I know JAVA also. As a system administrator the thing i use most are the command line of UNIX and Perl. But that's

At the time computers were mainframes and you did fed them with programms by punch cards. Programing was writing down the program, than you punched it and the next day you get results, mostly error. That's the way it worked at that time. To teach us programing, they used the langage of that time, Fortran and some kind of invented assembly langage, it didn't really exist, it was simplified.\n\nMost of the time you did write down your program, the teacher and the assistant would have to tell you what is wrong or good, you didn't had much practical experience.\n\n**How was it like, tons of pages ?** \n\nNo. As an anecdocte, i remember punchcards were a block of papers, we were jealous of the people who came in the computer center with huge stacks of cards.

We didn't touch the machines, operators would change the disks, we could only access the typewriter. That was our most direct connexion to the computer. Thetimes were diffent. The mainframes were such huge costly beasts that it had operators day and night keeping it busy.

There were still operators at the main computer of the university, but there were also small computers, so researchers and student can have direct access when needed. It depend\n\n**When did you start to work with software sold by others or gived away in order to do your research?** \n\nYou did need an operating system on the mainframe that was delivered by IBM or the constructor delivering the mainframe. When you bought mini-computers, which were the  smaller versions of mainframes, in most cases you did buy an operating systems, compilers and all the stuff you need to be able to work with all those things. In most cases, because the computer sciences department did buy the mini-computer from for instance *digital equipment corporation*  a manufactorer of that time, they didn't buy the software from them. It was not open source or free,  but you could get Unix and could run it on those digital equipment computers. That is what the computer department of the University of Louvain la Neuve *l'unité d'informatique* , did.\n\n**When did you start working with unix as an os?** \n\nI took a trip to Amsterdam in 1979/80… Well, the story starts in our french sister university (LLN) where they did have a PDP-11 with Unix on it. You got Unix, at the time, when you were a university, from Bell Aps (Ma Bell). It was a mega organisation at the time [before the [dismantlment of AT&T/Bell system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breakup_of_the_Bell_System)]. They splitted up in different Baby Bells. They couldn't sell it really. For unvirsities you did get the source and no support. How to install it ,no idea. We got the same computer that unix were developped on.  In LLN, They got the disk by snail mail as a post-office package \nHere, we did have a cheaper PDP11 (DEC - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PDP-11) We go the disk but we could not run it. Somebody here did write a driver for that disk in l'unité d'informatique of LLN.  The nearest place was in Amsterdam.  Andrew Tenebaum who did write a number of books on operating systems was working there. It was the young Tanenbaum, just arriving from United States to Amsterdam. He was learning to speak dutch. We did understood his english better but his assistant insisted that he speaks dutch because he will have to pass an exam in dutch.\nWe got a disk with, that disk we got here and we start using Unix.\n\n\n\n\n\n","attribs":"|1+g*6|2+2*5+3p*6|1+1*5+4f*6|2+2+dm*6|2+2+4n*6|1+1|1+1*5+11*6|2+2+bc*6|2+2+5z*2+3e*3+1*4*3+20*4+1*6|2+2+e7*6|2+2+7n*6|2+2*5+1a*6|2+2+53*6|2+2*5+19*6|2+2+c7*6|2+2*5+1r*6|2+2+jo*6|1+1+41*6|2+2*5+1a*6|2+2+33*0+5+27*0+a*6|2+2*5+2w*6|2+2+kr*6|2+2*5+1f*6|2+2+60*5+7+bt*6|1+1*2+fo*6|1+1*2+1u*6|5+5|1+1"}}},"pad:observatory.guide.jeanhuensitvextended:revs:5000":{"changeset":"Z:axd>2|26=av9=1t*0+2$w ","meta":{"author":"a.kqv62Q3nhchdwIuK","timestamp":1518098700263,"atext":{"text":"% __NOPUBLISH__\n\n\n**You have been using computers since a long time, as you explained us during the tour we had the joy of assisting during the TGSO.**\n**I heard that that until recently, let's say the late 1990's, when learning computer programming you had to start by  writing down the program on paper... ** \n\nIn 1973, i did study computer sciences, it was the second year of the department, here in Leuven. At the time computers were mainframes and you did fed them with programms by punch cards. Programing was writing down the program, than you punched it and the next day you get results, mostly error.

They were not open source or free,  but you could get Unix and could run it on those digital equipment (DEC) computers. That is what the computer department of the University of Louvain la Neuve *l'unité d'informatique*, did and so did we.\n\n**When did you start working with unix as an os?** \n\nI took a trip to Amsterdam, it must have been in 1979/80… Well, the story starts in our french sister university (LLN) where they did have a PDP-11 with Unix on it https://hackadaycom.files.wordpress.com/2016/08/full-size-pdp11.jpg. You got Unix, at the time, when you were a university, from Bell Aps (Ma Bell), the american telephone company. It was a mega organisation at the time [before the [dismantlment of AT&T/Bell system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breakup_of_the_Bell_System)].Due to monopoly, the US authorities splitted up in different Baby Bells. One of the restriction was there was a research baby bell, they couldn't really sell anything.There were computer scientists there, who did developped some Unix interesting things.  For universities you did get the source and no support for free. How to install it, no idea. In Unité d'informatique, they were lucky: they got the same computer that unix were developped on.  They got the disk by snail mail as a post-office package. They mounted it and it did spin up and they had it.\nHere, we did have a cheaper PDP11 (DEC - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PDP-11) We go the disk source from Bell Aps but we could not run it. We could look at it but that was all, because our disc format was different than the one at Bell Aps. Somebody here did write a driver for that disk and we did compiled it in l'unité d'informatique of LLN.  it did compile it but we couldn't try it because we did not have So we find the nearest Unix system compatiblewith ours, it was in Amsterdam.  Andrew Tenebaum who did write since then a number of books about operating systems and became quite an authority. He was working there. It was the young Tanenbaum, just arriving from United States to Amsterdam. He was learning to speak dutch. We did understood his english better but his assistant insisted that he speaks dutch because he will have to pass an exam in dutch. There we got a disk, than also the one with the driver we compiled, than we got here and we start using Unix.  Than in my opinion the start of open source was Unix because we had to maintain it by ourselves and we learned a lot from the sources.\nIn that time we did had to get software and it brings us to different places. For example, at the time the agents at the custom at the airport or post didn't know what to do with the discs in terms of custom clearance. They used magnetic or xrays, we had to write on the package that it should not be x-rayed. But we got time to time unreadable discs. \n\n**So it took like weeks between the transportation, the custom...**\nYes, the custom had to clear the packages. I remember i've been in the customs in Zaventem. I had received a letter that my package from Bell Aps had arrived. I went there thinking i would have to pay something and go. But no. It had to be cleared so there wa some organisation that had to do administrative stuff, so i only got it a few days later. The response time was huge :)\n\n**Than after that period of time how did you switch from that kind of collaboration on how to make software and make software work to collaboration on networks, between universities and researchers...**\nIn the Unix system of that time there was a kind of networking protocol which only did work on serial lines.\n You could connect two unix systems together you only need a line. We had one between LLN and Leuven, it's only 15 kms, but we had to ask Belgacom, than La Régie des télégraphes et téléphones, to get a modem to connect through their network and than over that modem you could reach an amazing speed of 300 characters per second. And that was the first communication. It did happened somewhere around 85. And then you had connexion with another computer, writing something here and do  something. And we could send programs to each other. \n \n **What was the first thing you did send through a network like this?**\n I didn't do it myself, i remember it was a kind of chat program. And on LLN side was Elie Milgrom, he is retired now. On this side, it was Pr Willems. And i remember that they typed something and they got a response from the other side and that was it.  But i remember that Pr Willems sent \"ok we stop now\". And that Elie Milgrom answered \"See you later, Alligator\" [a reference to Bill Haley and the Comets].  At the time we still had these kind of songs in mind. (lol). Those Unix to Unix connexions were first. And there was a worldwide Unix to Unix based network, Usenet (1979), it still exists somewhere... you can download load  of illegal movies and that stuff, that was not what we meant at the time. But that is what is left. And Usenet became gradually replaced by the Internet in USA. In Europe, the Internet came a lot later, but we had access to the Internet, we could send mail to them and we could receive mail from them, because some friendly american university, later companies, did translate internet mail to UCP mail. That was before the 1990's.\n \n **Your relation to software had changed at the time because you did not have to do all this manipulations with the software your received... Was it already floppy discs ?**\n No, magnetic tapes, for the mainframe at least. Most of the mini-computers had some cheaper magnetic tapes. Between 90 and 95 the main machines for the software institute was a VAX from DEC. Once a year the software came from Berkeley, it was still Unix but modified by Berkeley for virtual memory and all the stuff which are common now. We received a tape, with lot of goodies, i still remember we didn't know what was on there but we scrutinised there to know what was there, what we can use.\nIn Europe, companies like Siemens were trying to set up software centers to make software avaiable, they were even trying to set up networks. Researchers did love the Internet, it worked, it was useful for their researchs. So companies in Europe, were trying to set up their own networks, i remember for example the X/OPEN transport protocol. Their was a lot of standards about what software layers should do, but it didn't succeed because sometime, 92 maybe, IBM decided to quit their own private network and to go forTCP/IP and was the switching point. Everything done for X/OPEN were suddently forgotten. For the mainframes, and certainly in Belgium computing was mainly mainframes, i'm talking about universities here, so when IBM decided to go for TCP/IP we followed even though things were really slow. For example, Belgacom was not interested in running the Domain Name System so we did it here, for some time, starting in 1993 with Pierre Verbaten (https://www.dnsbelgium.be/en/history). Belgacom were focused on X25 (DCS - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X.25) so they missed it.\n\nIt was like the french Minitel ? \nWell, at that time we were really jealous about Minitel. Could you imagine that? Terminals?  At home ? You could work home with a computer ! You could send emails ! All in one, a pc computer with a modem ! \n\nHow did the research about software evolved in the department?\nI am mainly talking about network research but here there were people working on numerical analysis, computing, artificial intelligence ... I was just not involved in those research so i don't know much about it \n\nYou were focused on software and network..\nYes, we did produce some software. We did make software to generate compilers, there was some A.I. software in Prolog, numerical analysis  libraries... Some were sold or shared, it depends.  \nWe did sell some software since the beginning i think when it was not even a department but a professor and a couple of students.\n\nIs it when you joined ? \nNo it was already a department. I did study dutch industrial engeneering in electronics. At the time in electronics you did hear something about computers, i was interested in it i wanted to know more. I heard they had started a year before a degree in computer engeneering. It was the first year where industrial engineer could join. The only thing we knew about computer were in movies. I wanted to know how it work. I'm not sure i still know now even if maybe i have some ideas...\n\nHow many langage do you know ?\nAssembly, FORTRAN, PL-1 the langage invented by IBM to be the universal one, C, Cobol. Perl, i don't know, so more. I'm not fluent in any other langages, but i can read any langage especially well writtened, i know i can understand it and learn it...I know JAVA also. As a system administrator the thing i use most are the command line of UNIX and Perl. But that's because i'm more familiar with those two so it goes faster.\n\nHow did you see the rise of personnal computer and the software that goes with ? \nI have to admit that we missed it. We didn't see that what was new \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","attribs":"|1+g*6|2+2*5+3p*6|1+1*5+4f*6|2+2+dm*6|2+2+4n*6|1+1|1+1*5+11*6|2+2+bc*6|2+2+5z*2+3e*3+1*4*3+20*4+1*6|2+2+e7*6|2+2+7n*6|2+2*5+1a*6|2+2+53*6|2+2*5+19*6|2+2+c7*6|2+2*5+1r*6|2+2+jo*6|1+1+41*6|2+2*5+1a*6|2+2+5g*6|2+2*5+2w*6|2+2+l6*6|2+2*5+1f*6|2+2+8f*5+7+kh*6|1+1+uu*0|1+1+9s*0|2+2*5+1v*0|1+1+aj*0|2+2*5+5m*0|1+1+30*0|1+1+48*2+15+9l*0|1+1+1*0|1+1+1*5+1y*0|1+1+tm*0|1+1+1*0|1+1*5+4t*0|1+1+dr*0|1+1+u6*0|2+2*5+x*0|1+1+5q*0|2+2*5+1q*0|1+1+5w*0|2+2*5+16*0|1+1+5b*0|1+1+3l*0|2+2*5+o*0|1+1+df*0|2+2*5+u*0|1+1+bs*0|8+4c*6|5+5|1+1"}}},"pad:observatory.guide.jeanhuensitvextended:revs:5001":{"changeset":"Z:axf>1|26=av9=1v*0+1$w","meta":{"author":"a.kqv62Q3nhchdwIuK","timestamp":1518098700772}},"pad:observatory.guide.jeanhuensitvextended:revs:5002":{"changeset":"Z:axg>3|26=av9=1w*0+3$as

At the time computers were mainframes and you did fed them with programms by punch cards. Programing was writing down the program, than you punched it and the next day you get results, mostly error. That's the way it worked at that time. To teach us programing, they used the langage of that time, Fortran and some kind of invented assembly langage, it didn't really exist, it was simplified.\n\nMost of the time you did write down your program, the teacher and the assistant would have to tell you what is wrong or good, you didn't had much practical experience.\n\n**How was it like, tons of pages ?** \n\nNo. As an anecdocte, i remember punchcards were a block of papers, we were jealous of the people who came in the computer center with huge stacks of cards. That were really small programs, not complicated one. The fact you had to learn to use the computer from scratch, everything was new, you couldn't rely on previous experiences, everything was new. And to start with small programs was difficult enough. \n\nThat was also the time when Edsger W. Dijkstra who forked the goto... i still remember him, in an audience, giving us a lecture on modernisation in programming at the International computing symposium 1977 in Liège (programming: from craft to scientific discipline https://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/EWD/transcriptions/EWD05xx/EWD566.html). He told usxx (i'll complete it as soon as possible. i need Jean's input)\"\n\nAnd then from 75 on, computers became cheaper and could be bought by departments and smaller entities. And than came the first interactive computer. Still beasts about two cubic meters, costing two millions belgian francs. But it was low enough to allow people to type in directly commands. I started working here in 75 as a researcher, it have evolved continuously and i saw computer getting cheaper and getting easier to use.The way to use it was simplified, you could start to go to the beast and try it out.\n\nI remember more or less: you did write down the program in Fortran for instance… We always thought in the beginning that it would work and it didn't, so after a turn around you were giving it back to the operator and you have to wait half a day or a night to get the results.\n\n**What kind of program you were working on?** \n\nI remember the first program i had to write was you got three numbers, you had to make the program decide if you construct a triangle with the numbers being the sides of the triangle.\n\n**That took an afternoon to be processed ?** \n\nWell, yeah. You had to imagine how to do it which was also one problem, than you prepare the card with the punching machine and you give the package of cards to the operator who was feeeding the computer with the cards. People had the taks to fed the computers by hands, with paper, cards, than disks and it lasts onto the magnetic disks period. And after a number of hours or a night you get a listing, a piece of paper, with the results.\n\n**When where you able to record the program onto the machine?**\n\nI think that happens between 75 and 80. After the punching cards which was already a way to record the program, we had  typewriters, terminals but we could record the programs, we could store them on the computer. We had magnetic discs. IBM had number for everything, i remember the 33-30 [manufactured from 1970 on] had a magnetic disk. We didn't touch the machines, operators would change the disks, we could only access the typewriter. That was our most direct connexion to the computer. Thetimes were diffent. The mainframes were such huge costly beasts that it had operators day and night keeping it busy. Even at night there were two or three guys mounting tapes, dismounting tapes, that kind of stuff.\nhttps://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/42/IBM_magnetic_disk_drives_3330%2B3333.png/600px-IBM_magnetic_disk_drives_3330%2B3333.png\n\n**When did you stop working with operators?** \n\nSomewhere between 85 and 90. There were still operators at the main computer of the university, but there were also small computers, so researchers and student can have direct access when needed. \n\n**When did you start to work with software sold by others or gived away in order to do your research?** \n\nYou stil need an operating system on the mainframe that was delivered by IBM or the constructor delivering the mainframe. When you bought mini-computers, which were the  smaller versions of mainframes, in most cases you did buy an operating systems, compilers and all the stuff you need to be able to program those things. In most cases, because the computer sciences department did buy the mini-computer from, for instance *digital equipment corporation*,  a manufactorer of that time, but they didn't buy their software. They were not open source or free,  but you could get Unix and could run it on those digital equipment (DEC) computers. That is what the computer department of the University of Louvain la Neuve *l'unité d'informatique*, did and so did we.\n\n**When did you start working with unix as an os?** \n\nI took a trip to Amsterdam, it must have been in 1979/80… Well, the story starts in our french sister university (LLN) where they did have a PDP-11 with Unix on it https://hackadaycom.files.wordpress.com/2016/08/full-size-pdp11.jpg. You got Unix, at the time, when you were a university, from Bell Aps (Ma Bell), the american telephone company. It was a mega organisation at the time [before the [dismantlment of AT&T/Bell system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breakup_of_the_Bell_System)].Due to monopoly, the US authorities splitted up in different Baby Bells. One of the restriction was there was a research baby bell, they couldn't really sell anything.There were computer scientists there, who did developped some Unix interesting things.  For universities you did get the source and no support for free. How to install it, no idea. In Unité d'informatique, they were lucky: they got the same computer that unix were developped on.  They got the disk by snail mail as a post-office package. They mounted it and it did spin up and they had it.\nHere, we did have a cheaper PDP11 (DEC - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PDP-11) We go the disk source from Bell Aps but we could not run it. We could look at it but that was all, because our disc format was different than the one at Bell Aps. Somebody here did write a driver for that disk and we did compiled it in l'unité d'informatique of LLN.  it did compile it but we couldn't try it because we did not have So we find the nearest Unix system compatiblewith ours, it was in Amsterdam.  Andrew Tenebaum who did write since then a number of books about operating systems and became quite an authority. He was working there. It was the young Tanenbaum, just arriving from United States to Amsterdam. He was learning to speak dutch. We did understood his english better but his assistant insisted that he speaks dutch because he will have to pass an exam in dutch. There we got a disk, than also the one with the driver we compiled, than we got here and we start using Unix.  Than in my opinion the start of open source was Unix because we had to maintain it by ourselves and we learned a lot from the sources.\nIn that time we did had to get software and it brings us to different places. For example, at the time the agents at the custom at the airport or post didn't know what to do with the discs in terms of custom clearance. They used magnetic or xrays, we had to write on the package that it should not be x-rayed. But we got time to time unreadable discs. \n\n**So it took like weeks between the transportation, the custom...**\nYes, the custom had to clear the packages. I remember i've been in the customs in Zaventem. I had received a letter that my package from Bell Aps had arrived. I went there thinking i would have to pay something and go. But no. It had to be cleared so there wa some organisation that had to do administrative stuff, so i only got it a few days later. The response time was huge :)\n\n**Than after that period of time how did you switch from that kind of collaboration on how to make software and make software work to collaboration on networks, between universities and researchers...**\nIn the Unix system of that time there was a kind of networking protocol which only did work on serial lines.\n You could connect two unix systems together you only need a line. We had one between LLN and Leuven, it's only 15 kms, but we had to ask Belgacom, than La Régie des télégraphes et téléphones, to get a modem to connect through their network and than over that modem you could reach an amazing speed of 300 characters per second. And that was the first communication. It did happened somewhere around 85. And then you had connexion with another computer, writing something here and do  something. And we could send programs to each other. \n \n **What was the first thing you did send through a network like this?**\n I didn't do it myself, i remember it was a kind of chat program. And on LLN side was Elie Milgrom, he is retired now. On this side, it was Pr Willems. And i remember that they typed something and they got a response from the other side and that was it.  But i remember that Pr Willems sent \"ok we stop now\". And that Elie Milgrom answered \"See you later, Alligator\" [a reference to Bill Haley and the Comets].  At the time we still had these kind of songs in mind. (lol). Those Unix to Unix connexions were first. And there was a worldwide Unix to Unix based network, Usenet (1979), it still exists somewhere... you can download load  of illegal movies and that stuff, that was not what we meant at the time. But that is what is left. And Usenet became gradually replaced by the Internet in USA. In Europe, the Internet came a lot later, but we had access to the Internet, we could send mail to them and we could receive mail from them, because some friendly american university, later companies, did translate internet mail to UCP mail. That was before the 1990's.\n \n **Your relation to software had changed at the time because you did not have to do all this manipulations with the software your received... Was it already floppy discs ?**\n No, magnetic tapes, for the mainframe at least. Most of the mini-computers had some cheaper magnetic tapes. Between 90 and 95 the main machines for the software institute was a VAX from DEC. Once a year the software came from Berkeley, it was still Unix but modified by Berkeley for virtual memory and all the stuff which are common now. We received a tape, with lot of goodies, i still remember we didn't know what was on there but we scrutinised there to know what was there, what we can use.\nIn Europe, companies like Siemens were trying to set up software centers to make software avaiable, they were even trying to set up networks. Researchers did love the Internet, it worked, it was useful for their researchs. So companies in Europe, were trying to set up their own networks, i remember for example the X/OPEN transport protocol. Their was a lot of standards about what software layers should do, but it didn't succeed because sometime, 92 maybe, IBM decided to quit their own private network and to go forTCP/IP and was the switching point. Everything done for X/OPEN were suddently forgotten. For the mainframes, and certainly in Belgium computing was mainly mainframes, i'm talking about universities here, so when IBM decided to go for TCP/IP we followed even though things were really slow. For example, Belgacom was not interested in running the Domain Name System so we did it here, for some time, starting in 1993 with Pierre Verbaten (https://www.dnsbelgium.be/en/history). Belgacom were focused on X25 (DCS - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X.25) so they missed it.\n\nIt was like the french Minitel ? \nWell, at that time we were really jealous about Minitel. Could you imagine that? Terminals?  At home ? You could work home with a computer ! You could send emails ! All in one, a pc computer with a modem ! \n\nHow did the research about software evolved in the department?\nI am mainly talking about network research but here there were people working on numerical analysis, computing, artificial intelligence ... I was just not involved in those research so i don't know much about it \n\nYou were focused on software and network..\nYes, we did produce some software. We did make software to generate compilers, there was some A.I. software in Prolog, numerical analysis  libraries... Some were sold or shared, it depends.  \nWe did sell some software since the beginning i think when it was not even a department but a professor and a couple of students.\n\nIs it when you joined ? \nNo it was already a department. I did study dutch industrial engeneering in electronics. At the time in electronics you did hear something about computers, i was interested in it i wanted to know more. I heard they had started a year before a degree in computer engeneering. It was the first year where industrial engineer could join. The only thing we knew about computer were in movies. I wanted to know how it work. I'm not sure i still know now even if maybe i have some ideas...\n\nHow many langage do you know ?\nAssembly, FORTRAN, PL-1 the langage invented by IBM to be the universal one, C, Cobol. Perl, i don't know, so more. I'm not fluent in any other langages, but i can read any langage especially well writtened, i know i can understand it and learn it...I know JAVA also. As a system administrator the thing i use most are the command line of UNIX and Perl. But that's because i'm more familiar with those two so it goes faster.\n\nHow did you see the rise of personnal computer and the software that goes with ? \nI have to admit that we missed it. We didn't see that what was new was powerful. We were not impressed by the software. I remember windows 95, the news on TV, people sleeping on the street to get it. I remember when i get my first windows version, with a box of 2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","attribs":"|1+g*6|2+2*5+3p*6|1+1*5+4f*6|2+2+dm*6|2+2+4n*6|1+1|1+1*5+11*6|2+2+bc*6|2+2+5z*2+3e*3+1*4*3+20*4+1*6|2+2+e7*6|2+2+7n*6|2+2*5+1a*6|2+2+53*6|2+2*5+19*6|2+2+c7*6|2+2*5+1r*6|2+2+jo*6|1+1+41*6|2+2*5+1a*6|2+2+5g*6|2+2*5+2w*6|2+2+l6*6|2+2*5+1f*6|2+2+8f*5+7+kh*6|1+1+uu*0|1+1+9s*0|2+2*5+1v*0|1+1+aj*0|2+2*5+5m*0|1+1+30*0|1+1+48*2+15+9l*0|1+1+1*0|1+1+1*5+1y*0|1+1+tm*0|1+1+1*0|1+1*5+4t*0|1+1+dr*0|1+1+u6*0|2+2*5+x*0|1+1+5q*0|2+2*5+1q*0|1+1+5w*0|2+2*5+16*0|1+1+5b*0|1+1+3l*0|2+2*5+o*0|1+1+df*0|2+2*5+u*0|1+1+bs*0|8+9s*6|5+5|1+1"}}},"pad:observatory.guide.jeanhuensitvextended:revs:5101":{"changeset":"Z:b2v>2|26=av9=7b*0+2$2 ","meta":{"author":"a.kqv62Q3nhchdwIuK","timestamp":1518098753982}},"pad:observatory.guide.jeanhuensitvextended:revs:5102":{"changeset":"Z:b2x>1|26=av9=7d*0+1$f","meta":{"author":"a.kqv62Q3nhchdwIuK","timestamp":1518098754501}},"pad:observatory.guide.jeanhuensitvextended:revs:5103":{"changeset":"Z:b2y>3|26=av9=7e*0+3$lop","meta":{"author":"a.kqv62Q3nhchdwIuK","timestamp":1518098755005}},"pad:observatory.guide.jeanhuensitvextended:revs:5104":{"changeset":"Z:b31>2|26=av9=7h*0+2$py","meta":{"author":"a.kqv62Q3nhchdwIuK","timestamp":1518098755506}},"pad:observatory.guide.jeanhuensitvextended:revs:5105":{"changeset":"Z:b33<1|26=av9=7i-1$","meta":{"author":"a.kqv62Q3nhchdwIuK","timestamp":1518098756218}},"pad:observatory.guide.jeanhuensitvextended:revs:5106":{"changeset":"Z:b32>2|26=av9=7i*0+2$ie","meta":{"author":"a.kqv62Q3nhchdwIuK","timestamp":1518098756719}},"pad:observatory.guide.jeanhuensitvextended:revs:5107":{"changeset":"Z:b34>3|26=av9=7k*0+3$s o","meta":{"author":"a.kqv62Q3nhchdwIuK","timestamp":1518098757220}},"pad:observatory.guide.jeanhuensitvextended:revs:5108":{"changeset":"Z:b37>2|26=av9=7n*0+2$r ","meta":{"author":"a.kqv62Q3nhchdwIuK","timestamp":1518098757720}},"pad:observatory.guide.jeanhuensitvextended:revs:5109":{"changeset":"Z:b39>2|26=av9=7p*0+2$so","meta":{"author":"a.kqv62Q3nhchdwIuK","timestamp":1518098758220}},"pad:observatory.guide.jeanhuensitvextended:revs:511":{"changeset":"Z:56c>4|13=3kc=8g*0+4$gram","meta":{"author":"a.kqv62Q3nhchdwIuK","timestamp":1518089071304}},"pad:observatory.guide.jeanhuensitvextended:revs:5110":{"changeset":"Z:b3b>2|26=av9=7r*0+2$.

At the time computers were mainframes and you did fed them with programms by punch cards. Programing was writing down the program, than you punched it and the next day you get results, mostly error. That's the way it worked at that time. To teach us programing, they used the langage of that time, Fortran and some kind of invented assembly langage, it didn't really exist, it was simplified.\n\nMost of the time you did write down your program, the teacher and the assistant would have to tell you what is wrong or good, you didn't had much practical experience.\n\n**How was it like, tons of pages ?** \n\nNo. As an anecdocte, i remember punchcards were a block of papers, we were jealous of the people who came in the computer center with huge stacks of cards. That were really small programs, not complicated one. The fact you had to learn to use the computer from scratch, everything was new, you couldn't rely on previous experiences, everything was new. And to start with small programs was difficult enough. \n\nThat was also the time when Edsger W. Dijkstra who forked the goto... i still remember him, in an audience, giving us a lecture on modernisation in programming at the International computing symposium 1977 in Liège (programming: from craft to scientific discipline https://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/EWD/transcriptions/EWD05xx/EWD566.html). He told usxx (i'll complete it as soon as possible. i need Jean's input)\"\n\nAnd then from 75 on, computers became cheaper and could be bought by departments and smaller entities. And than came the first interactive computer. Still beasts about two cubic meters, costing two millions belgian francs. But it was low enough to allow people to type in directly commands. I started working here in 75 as a researcher, it have evolved continuously and i saw computer getting cheaper and getting easier to use.The way to use it was simplified, you could start to go to the beast and try it out.\n\nI remember more or less: you did write down the program in Fortran for instance… We always thought in the beginning that it would work and it didn't, so after a turn around you were giving it back to the operator and you have to wait half a day or a night to get the results.\n\n**What kind of program you were working on?** \n\nI remember the first program i had to write was you got three numbers, you had to make the program decide if you construct a triangle with the numbers being the sides of the triangle.\n\n**That took an afternoon to be processed ?** \n\nWell, yeah. You had to imagine how to do it which was also one problem, than you prepare the card with the punching machine and you give the package of cards to the operator who was feeeding the computer with the cards. People had the taks to fed the computers by hands, with paper, cards, than disks and it lasts onto the magnetic disks period. And after a number of hours or a night you get a listing, a piece of paper, with the results.\n\n**When where you able to record the program onto the machine?**\n\nI think that happens between 75 and 80. After the punching cards which was already a way to record the program, we had  typewriters, terminals but we could record the programs, we could store them on the computer. We had magnetic discs. IBM had number for everything, i remember the 33-30 [manufactured from 1970 on] had a magnetic disk. We didn't touch the machines, operators would change the disks, we could only access the typewriter. That was our most direct connexion to the computer. Thetimes were diffent. The mainframes were such huge costly beasts that it had operators day and night keeping it busy. Even at night there were two or three guys mounting tapes, dismounting tapes, that kind of stuff.\nhttps://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/42/IBM_magnetic_disk_drives_3330%2B3333.png/600px-IBM_magnetic_disk_drives_3330%2B3333.png\n\n**When did you stop working with operators?** \n\nSomewhere between 85 and 90. There were still operators at the main computer of the university, but there were also small computers, so researchers and student can have direct access when needed. \n\n**When did you start to work with software sold by others or gived away in order to do your research?** \n\nYou stil need an operating system on the mainframe that was delivered by IBM or the constructor delivering the mainframe. When you bought mini-computers, which were the  smaller versions of mainframes, in most cases you did buy an operating systems, compilers and all the stuff you need to be able to program those things. In most cases, because the computer sciences department did buy the mini-computer from, for instance *digital equipment corporation*,  a manufactorer of that time, but they didn't buy their software. They were not open source or free,  but you could get Unix and could run it on those digital equipment (DEC) computers. That is what the computer department of the University of Louvain la Neuve *l'unité d'informatique*, did and so did we.\n\n**When did you start working with unix as an os?** \n\nI took a trip to Amsterdam, it must have been in 1979/80… Well, the story starts in our french sister university (LLN) where they did have a PDP-11 with Unix on it https://hackadaycom.files.wordpress.com/2016/08/full-size-pdp11.jpg. You got Unix, at the time, when you were a university, from Bell Aps (Ma Bell), the american telephone company. It was a mega organisation at the time [before the [dismantlment of AT&T/Bell system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breakup_of_the_Bell_System)].Due to monopoly, the US authorities splitted up in different Baby Bells. One of the restriction was there was a research baby bell, they couldn't really sell anything.There were computer scientists there, who did developped some Unix interesting things.  For universities you did get the source and no support for free. How to install it, no idea. In Unité d'informatique, they were lucky: they got the same computer that unix were developped on.  They got the disk by snail mail as a post-office package. They mounted it and it did spin up and they had it.\nHere, we did have a cheaper PDP11 (DEC - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PDP-11) We go the disk source from Bell Aps but we could not run it. We could look at it but that was all, because our disc format was different than the one at Bell Aps. Somebody here did write a driver for that disk and we did compiled it in l'unité d'informatique of LLN.  it did compile it but we couldn't try it because we did not have So we find the nearest Unix system compatiblewith ours, it was in Amsterdam.  Andrew Tenebaum who did write since then a number of books about operating systems and became quite an authority. He was working there. It was the young Tanenbaum, just arriving from United States to Amsterdam. He was learning to speak dutch. We did understood his english better but his assistant insisted that he speaks dutch because he will have to pass an exam in dutch. There we got a disk, than also the one with the driver we compiled, than we got here and we start using Unix.  Than in my opinion the start of open source was Unix because we had to maintain it by ourselves and we learned a lot from the sources.\nIn that time we did had to get software and it brings us to different places. For example, at the time the agents at the custom at the airport or post didn't know what to do with the discs in terms of custom clearance. They used magnetic or xrays, we had to write on the package that it should not be x-rayed. But we got time to time unreadable discs. \n\n**So it took like weeks between the transportation, the custom...**\nYes, the custom had to clear the packages. I remember i've been in the customs in Zaventem. I had received a letter that my package from Bell Aps had arrived. I went there thinking i would have to pay something and go. But no. It had to be cleared so there wa some organisation that had to do administrative stuff, so i only got it a few days later. The response time was huge :)\n\n**Than after that period of time how did you switch from that kind of collaboration on how to make software and make software work to collaboration on networks, between universities and researchers...**\nIn the Unix system of that time there was a kind of networking protocol which only did work on serial lines.\n You could connect two unix systems together you only need a line. We had one between LLN and Leuven, it's only 15 kms, but we had to ask Belgacom, than La Régie des télégraphes et téléphones, to get a modem to connect through their network and than over that modem you could reach an amazing speed of 300 characters per second. And that was the first communication. It did happened somewhere around 85. And then you had connexion with another computer, writing something here and do  something. And we could send programs to each other. \n \n **What was the first thing you did send through a network like this?**\n I didn't do it myself, i remember it was a kind of chat program. And on LLN side was Elie Milgrom, he is retired now. On this side, it was Pr Willems. And i remember that they typed something and they got a response from the other side and that was it.  But i remember that Pr Willems sent \"ok we stop now\". And that Elie Milgrom answered \"See you later, Alligator\" [a reference to Bill Haley and the Comets].  At the time we still had these kind of songs in mind. (lol). Those Unix to Unix connexions were first. And there was a worldwide Unix to Unix based network, Usenet (1979), it still exists somewhere... you can download load  of illegal movies and that stuff, that was not what we meant at the time. But that is what is left. And Usenet became gradually replaced by the Internet in USA. In Europe, the Internet came a lot later, but we had access to the Internet, we could send mail to them and we could receive mail from them, because some friendly american university, later companies, did translate internet mail to UCP mail. That was before the 1990's.\n \n **Your relation to software had changed at the time because you did not have to do all this manipulations with the software your received... Was it already floppy discs ?**\n No, magnetic tapes, for the mainframe at least. Most of the mini-computers had some cheaper magnetic tapes. Between 90 and 95 the main machines for the software institute was a VAX from DEC. Once a year the software came from Berkeley, it was still Unix but modified by Berkeley for virtual memory and all the stuff which are common now. We received a tape, with lot of goodies, i still remember we didn't know what was on there but we scrutinised there to know what was there, what we can use.\nIn Europe, companies like Siemens were trying to set up software centers to make software avaiable, they were even trying to set up networks. Researchers did love the Internet, it worked, it was useful for their researchs. So companies in Europe, were trying to set up their own networks, i remember for example the X/OPEN transport protocol. Their was a lot of standards about what software layers should do, but it didn't succeed because sometime, 92 maybe, IBM decided to quit their own private network and to go forTCP/IP and was the switching point. Everything done for X/OPEN were suddently forgotten. For the mainframes, and certainly in Belgium computing was mainly mainframes, i'm talking about universities here, so when IBM decided to go for TCP/IP we followed even though things were really slow. For example, Belgacom was not interested in running the Domain Name System so we did it here, for some time, starting in 1993 with Pierre Verbaten (https://www.dnsbelgium.be/en/history). Belgacom were focused on X25 (DCS - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X.25) so they missed it.\n\nIt was like the french Minitel ? \nWell, at that time we were really jealous about Minitel. Could you imagine that? Terminals?  At home ? You could work home with a computer ! You could send emails ! All in one, a pc computer with a modem ! \n\nHow did the research about software evolved in the department?\nI am mainly talking about network research but here there were people working on numerical analysis, computing, artificial intelligence ... I was just not involved in those research so i don't know much about it \n\nYou were focused on software and network..\nYes, we did produce some software. We did make software to generate compilers, there was some A.I. software in Prolog, numerical analysis  libraries... Some were sold or shared, it depends.  \nWe did sell some software since the beginning i think when it was not even a department but a professor and a couple of students.\n\nIs it when you joined ? \nNo it was already a department. I did study dutch industrial engeneering in electronics. At the time in electronics you did hear something about computers, i was interested in it i wanted to know more. I heard they had started a year before a degree in computer engeneering. It was the first year where industrial engineer could join. The only thing we knew about computer were in movies. I wanted to know how it work. I'm not sure i still know now even if maybe i have some ideas...\n\nHow many langage do you know ?\nAssembly, FORTRAN, PL-1 the langage invented by IBM to be the universal one, C, Cobol. Perl, i don't know, so more. I'm not fluent in any other langages, but i can read any langage especially well writtened, i know i can understand it and learn it...I know JAVA also. As a system administrator the thing i use most are the command line of UNIX and Perl. But that's because i'm more familiar with those two so it goes faster.\n\nHow did you see the rise of personnal computer and the software that goes with ? \nI have to admit that we missed it. We didn't see that what was new was powerful. We were not impressed by the software. I remember windows 95, the news on TV, people sleeping on the street to get it. I remember when i get my first windows version, with a box of 22 floppies or so. Then i wanted to do something, to compile a program, but there was no compiler. We were used to Unix, a basic system but with a lot of utilities in it. So\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","attribs":"|1+g*6|2+2*5+3p*6|1+1*5+4f*6|2+2+dm*6|2+2+4n*6|1+1|1+1*5+11*6|2+2+bc*6|2+2+5z*2+3e*3+1*4*3+20*4+1*6|2+2+e7*6|2+2+7n*6|2+2*5+1a*6|2+2+53*6|2+2*5+19*6|2+2+c7*6|2+2*5+1r*6|2+2+jo*6|1+1+41*6|2+2*5+1a*6|2+2+5g*6|2+2*5+2w*6|2+2+l6*6|2+2*5+1f*6|2+2+8f*5+7+kh*6|1+1+uu*0|1+1+9s*0|2+2*5+1v*0|1+1+aj*0|2+2*5+5m*0|1+1+30*0|1+1+48*2+15+9l*0|1+1+1*0|1+1+1*5+1y*0|1+1+tm*0|1+1+1*0|1+1*5+4t*0|1+1+dr*0|1+1+u6*0|2+2*5+x*0|1+1+5q*0|2+2*5+1q*0|1+1+5w*0|2+2*5+16*0|1+1+5b*0|1+1+3l*0|2+2*5+o*0|1+1+df*0|2+2*5+u*0|1+1+bs*0|2+2*5+29*0|1+1+a0*0|6+29*6|5+5|1+1"}}},"pad:observatory.guide.jeanhuensitvextended:revs:5201":{"changeset":"Z:b7o>2|26=av9=c3*0+2$ft","meta":{"author":"a.kqv62Q3nhchdwIuK","timestamp":1518099079511}},"pad:observatory.guide.jeanhuensitvextended:revs:5202":{"changeset":"Z:b7q>3|26=av9=c5*0+3$war","meta":{"author":"a.kqv62Q3nhchdwIuK","timestamp":1518099080011}},"pad:observatory.guide.jeanhuensitvextended:revs:5203":{"changeset":"Z:b7t>2|26=av9=c8*0+2$e

At the time computers were mainframes and you did fed them with programms by punch cards. Programing was writing down the program, than you punched it and the next day you get results, mostly error. That's the way it worked at that time. To teach us programing, they used the langage of that time, Fortran and some kind of invented assembly langage, it didn't really exist, it was simplified.\n\nMost of the time you did write down your program, the teacher and the assistant would have to tell you what is wrong or good, you didn't had much practical experience.\n\n**How was it like, tons of pages ?** \n\nNo. As an anecdocte, i remember punchcards were a block of papers, we were jealous of the people who came in the computer center with huge stacks of cards. That were really small programs, not complicated one. The fact you had to learn to use the computer from scratch, everything was new, you couldn't rely on previous experiences, everything was new. And to start with small programs was difficult enough. \n\nThat was also the time when Edsger W. Dijkstra who forked the goto... i still remember him, in an audience, giving us a lecture on modernisation in programming at the International computing symposium 1977 in Liège (programming: from craft to scientific discipline https://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/EWD/transcriptions/EWD05xx/EWD566.html). He told usxx (i'll complete it as soon as possible. i need Jean's input)\"\n\nAnd then from 75 on, computers became cheaper and could be bought by departments and smaller entities. And than came the first interactive computer. Still beasts about two cubic meters, costing two millions belgian francs. But it was low enough to allow people to type in directly commands. I started working here in 75 as a researcher, it have evolved continuously and i saw computer getting cheaper and getting easier to use.The way to use it was simplified, you could start to go to the beast and try it out.\n\nI remember more or less: you did write down the program in Fortran for instance… We always thought in the beginning that it would work and it didn't, so after a turn around you were giving it back to the operator and you have to wait half a day or a night to get the results.\n\n**What kind of program you were working on?** \n\nI remember the first program i had to write was you got three numbers, you had to make the program decide if you construct a triangle with the numbers being the sides of the triangle.\n\n**That took an afternoon to be processed ?** \n\nWell, yeah. You had to imagine how to do it which was also one problem, than you prepare the card with the punching machine and you give the package of cards to the operator who was feeeding the computer with the cards. People had the taks to fed the computers by hands, with paper, cards, than disks and it lasts onto the magnetic disks period. And after a number of hours or a night you get a listing, a piece of paper, with the results.\n\n**When where you able to record the program onto the machine?**\n\nI think that happens between 75 and 80. After the punching cards which was already a way to record the program, we had  typewriters, terminals but we could record the programs, we could store them on the computer. We had magnetic discs. IBM had number for everything, i remember the 33-30 [manufactured from 1970 on] had a magnetic disk. We didn't touch the machines, operators would change the disks, we could only access the typewriter. That was our most direct connexion to the computer. Thetimes were diffent. The mainframes were such huge costly beasts that it had operators day and night keeping it busy. Even at night there were two or three guys mounting tapes, dismounting tapes, that kind of stuff.\nhttps://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/42/IBM_magnetic_disk_drives_3330%2B3333.png/600px-IBM_magnetic_disk_drives_3330%2B3333.png\n\n**When did you stop working with operators?** \n\nSomewhere between 85 and 90. There were still operators at the main computer of the university, but there were also small computers, so researchers and student can have direct access when needed. \n\n**When did you start to work with software sold by others or gived away in order to do your research?** \n\nYou stil need an operating system on the mainframe that was delivered by IBM or the constructor delivering the mainframe. When you bought mini-computers, which were the  smaller versions of mainframes, in most cases you did buy an operating systems, compilers and all the stuff you need to be able to program those things. In most cases, because the computer sciences department did buy the mini-computer from, for instance *digital equipment corporation*,  a manufactorer of that time, but they didn't buy their software. They were not open source or free,  but you could get Unix and could run it on those digital equipment (DEC) computers. That is what the computer department of the University of Louvain la Neuve *l'unité d'informatique*, did and so did we.\n\n**When did you start working with unix as an os?** \n\nI took a trip to Amsterdam, it must have been in 1979/80… Well, the story starts in our french sister university (LLN) where they did have a PDP-11 with Unix on it https://hackadaycom.files.wordpress.com/2016/08/full-size-pdp11.jpg. You got Unix, at the time, when you were a university, from Bell Aps (Ma Bell), the american telephone company. It was a mega organisation at the time [before the [dismantlment of AT&T/Bell system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breakup_of_the_Bell_System)].Due to monopoly, the US authorities splitted up in different Baby Bells. One of the restriction was there was a research baby bell, they couldn't really sell anything.There were computer scientists there, who did developped some Unix interesting things.  For universities you did get the source and no support for free. How to install it, no idea. In Unité d'informatique, they were lucky: they got the same computer that unix were developped on.  They got the disk by snail mail as a post-office package. They mounted it and it did spin up and they had it.\nHere, we did have a cheaper PDP11 (DEC - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PDP-11) We go the disk source from Bell Aps but we could not run it. We could look at it but that was all, because our disc format was different than the one at Bell Aps. Somebody here did write a driver for that disk and we did compiled it in l'unité d'informatique of LLN.  it did compile it but we couldn't try it because we did not have So we find the nearest Unix system compatiblewith ours, it was in Amsterdam.  Andrew Tenebaum who did write since then a number of books about operating systems and became quite an authority. He was working there. It was the young Tanenbaum, just arriving from United States to Amsterdam. He was learning to speak dutch. We did understood his english better but his assistant insisted that he speaks dutch because he will have to pass an exam in dutch. There we got a disk, than also the one with the driver we compiled, than we got here and we start using Unix.  Than in my opinion the start of open source was Unix because we had to maintain it by ourselves and we learned a lot from the sources.\nIn that time we did had to get software and it brings us to different places. For example, at the time the agents at the custom at the airport or post didn't know what to do with the discs in terms of custom clearance. They used magnetic or xrays, we had to write on the package that it should not be x-rayed. But we got time to time unreadable discs. \n\n**So it took like weeks between the transportation, the custom...**\nYes, the custom had to clear the packages. I remember i've been in the customs in Zaventem. I had received a letter that my package from Bell Aps had arrived. I went there thinking i would have to pay something and go. But no. It had to be cleared so there wa some organisation that had to do administrative stuff, so i only got it a few days later. The response time was huge :)\n\n**Than after that period of time how did you switch from that kind of collaboration on how to make software and make software work to collaboration on networks, between universities and researchers...**\nIn the Unix system of that time there was a kind of networking protocol which only did work on serial lines.\n You could connect two unix systems together you only need a line. We had one between LLN and Leuven, it's only 15 kms, but we had to ask Belgacom, than La Régie des télégraphes et téléphones, to get a modem to connect through their network and than over that modem you could reach an amazing speed of 300 characters per second. And that was the first communication. It did happened somewhere around 85. And then you had connexion with another computer, writing something here and do  something. And we could send programs to each other. \n \n **What was the first thing you did send through a network like this?**\n I didn't do it myself, i remember it was a kind of chat program. And on LLN side was Elie Milgrom, he is retired now. On this side, it was Pr Willems. And i remember that they typed something and they got a response from the other side and that was it.  But i remember that Pr Willems sent \"ok we stop now\". And that Elie Milgrom answered \"See you later, Alligator\" [a reference to Bill Haley and the Comets].  At the time we still had these kind of songs in mind. (lol). Those Unix to Unix connexions were first. And there was a worldwide Unix to Unix based network, Usenet (1979), it still exists somewhere... you can download load  of illegal movies and that stuff, that was not what we meant at the time. But that is what is left. And Usenet became gradually replaced by the Internet in USA. In Europe, the Internet came a lot later, but we had access to the Internet, we could send mail to them and we could receive mail from them, because some friendly american university, later companies, did translate internet mail to UCP mail. That was before the 1990's.\n \n **Your relation to software had changed at the time because you did not have to do all this manipulations with the software your received... Was it already floppy discs ?**\n No, magnetic tapes, for the mainframe at least. Most of the mini-computers had some cheaper magnetic tapes. Between 90 and 95 the main machines for the software institute was a VAX from DEC. Once a year the software came from Berkeley, it was still Unix but modified by Berkeley for virtual memory and all the stuff which are common now. We received a tape, with lot of goodies, i still remember we didn't know what was on there but we scrutinised there to know what was there, what we can use.\nIn Europe, companies like Siemens were trying to set up software centers to make software avaiable, they were even trying to set up networks. Researchers did love the Internet, it worked, it was useful for their researchs. So companies in Europe, were trying to set up their own networks, i remember for example the X/OPEN transport protocol. Their was a lot of standards about what software layers should do, but it didn't succeed because sometime, 92 maybe, IBM decided to quit their own private network and to go forTCP/IP and was the switching point. Everything done for X/OPEN were suddently forgotten. For the mainframes, and certainly in Belgium computing was mainly mainframes, i'm talking about universities here, so when IBM decided to go for TCP/IP we followed even though things were really slow. For example, Belgacom was not interested in running the Domain Name System so we did it here, for some time, starting in 1993 with Pierre Verbaten (https://www.dnsbelgium.be/en/history). Belgacom were focused on X25 (DCS - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X.25) so they missed it.\n\nIt was like the french Minitel ? \nWell, at that time we were really jealous about Minitel. Could you imagine that? Terminals?  At home ? You could work home with a computer ! You could send emails ! All in one, a pc computer with a modem ! \n\nHow did the research about software evolved in the department?\nI am mainly talking about network research but here there were people working on numerical analysis, computing, artificial intelligence ... I was just not involved in those research so i don't know much about it \n\nYou were focused on software and network..\nYes, we did produce some software. We did make software to generate compilers, there was some A.I. software in Prolog, numerical analysis  libraries... Some were sold or shared, it depends.  \nWe did sell some software since the beginning i think when it was not even a department but a professor and a couple of students.\n\nIs it when you joined ? \nNo it was already a department. I did study dutch industrial engeneering in electronics. At the time in electronics you did hear something about computers, i was interested in it i wanted to know more. I heard they had started a year before a degree in computer engeneering. It was the first year where industrial engineer could join. The only thing we knew about computer were in movies. I wanted to know how it work. I'm not sure i still know now even if maybe i have some ideas...\n\nHow many langage do you know ?\nAssembly, FORTRAN, PL-1 the langage invented by IBM to be the universal one, C, Cobol. Perl, i don't know, so more. I'm not fluent in any other langages, but i can read any langage especially well writtened, i know i can understand it and learn it...I know JAVA also. As a system administrator the thing i use most are the command line of UNIX and Perl. But that's because i'm more familiar with those two so it goes faster.\n\nHow did you see the rise of personnal computer and the software that goes with ? \nI have to admit that we missed it. We didn't see that what was new was powerful. We were not impressed by the software. I remember windows 95, the news on TV, people sleeping on the street to get it. I remember when i get my first windows version, with a box of 22 floppies or so. Then i wanted to do something, to compile a program, but there was no compiler.

the joy of assisting during the TGSO.**\n**I heard that that until recently, let's say the late 1990's, when learning computer programming you had to start by  writing down the program on paper... ** \n\nIn 1973, i did study computer sciences, it was the second year of the department, here in Leuven. At the time computers were mainframes and you did fed them with programms by punch cards. Programing was writing down the program, than you punched it and the next day you get results, mostly error. That's the way it worked at that time. To teach us programing, they used the langage of that time, Fortran and some kind of invented assembly langage, it didn't really exist, it was simplified.\n\nMost of the time you did write down your program, the teacher and the assistant would have to tell you what is wrong or good, you didn't had much practical experience.\n\n**How was it like, tons of pages ?** \n\nNo. As an anecdocte, i remember punchcards were a block of papers, we were jealous of the people who came in the computer center with huge stacks of cards. That were really small programs, not complicated one. The fact you had to learn to use the computer from scratch, everything was new, you couldn't rely on previous experiences, everything was new. And to start with small programs was difficult enough. \n\nThat was also the time when Edsger W. Dijkstra who forked the goto... i still remember him, in an audience, giving us a lecture on modernisation in programming at the International computing symposium 1977 in Liège (programming: from craft to scientific discipline https://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/EWD/transcriptions/EWD05xx/EWD566.html). He told usxx (i'll complete it as soon as possible. i need Jean's input)\"\n\nAnd then from 75 on, computers became cheaper and could be bought by departments and smaller entities. And than came the first interactive computer. Still beasts about two cubic meters, costing two millions belgian francs. But it was low enough to allow people to type in directly commands. I started working here in 75 as a researcher, it have evolved continuously and i saw computer getting cheaper and getting easier to use.The way to use it was simplified, you could start to go to the beast and try it out.\n\nI remember more or less: you did write down the program in Fortran for instance… We always thought in the beginning that it would work and it didn't, so after a turn around you were giving it back to the operator and you have to wait half a day or a night to get the results.\n\n**What kind of program you were working on?** \n\nI remember the first program i had to write was you got three numbers, you had to make the program decide if you construct a triangle with the numbers being the sides of the triangle.\n\n**That took an afternoon to be processed ?** \n\nWell, yeah. You had to imagine how to do it which was also one problem, than you prepare the card with the punching machine and you give the package of cards to the operator who was feeeding the computer with the cards. People had the taks to fed the computers by hands, with paper, cards, than disks and it lasts onto the magnetic disks period. And after a number of hours or a night you get a listing, a piece of paper, with the results.\n\n**When where you able to record the program onto the machine?**\n\nI think that happens between 75 and 80. After the punching cards which was already a way to record the program, we had  typewriters, terminals but we could record the programs, we could store them on the computer. We had magnetic discs. IBM had number for everything, i remember the 33-30 [manufactured from 1970 on] had a magnetic disk. We didn't touch the machines, operators would change the disks, we could only access the typewriter. That was our most direct connexion to the computer. Thetimes were diffent. The mainframes were such huge costly beasts that it had operators day and night keeping it busy. Even at night there were two or three guys mounting tapes, dismounting tapes, that kind of stuff.\nhttps://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/42/IBM_magnetic_disk_drives_3330%2B3333.png/600px-IBM_magnetic_disk_drives_3330%2B3333.png\n\n**When did you stop working with operators?** \n\nSomewhere between 85 and 90. There were still operators at the main computer of the university, but there were also small computers, so researchers and student can have direct access when needed. \n\n**When did you start to work with software sold by others or gived away in order to do your research?** \n\nYou stil need an operating system on the mainframe that was delivered by IBM or the constructor delivering the mainframe. When you bought mini-computers, which were the  smaller versions of mainframes, in most cases you did buy an operating systems, compilers and all the stuff you need to be able to program those things. In most cases, because the computer sciences department did buy the mini-computer from, for instance *digital equipment corporation*,  a manufactorer of that time, but they didn't buy their software. They were not open source or free,  but you could get Unix and could run it on those digital equipment (DEC) computers. That is what the computer department of the University of Louvain la Neuve *l'unité d'informatique*, did and so did we.\n\n**When did you start working with unix as an os?** \n\nI took a trip to Amsterdam, it must have been in 1979/80… Well, the story starts in our french sister university (LLN) where they did have a PDP-11 with Unix on it https://hackadaycom.files.wordpress.com/2016/08/full-size-pdp11.jpg. You got Unix, at the time, when you were a university, from Bell Aps (Ma Bell), the american telephone company. It was a mega organisation at the time [before the [dismantlment of AT&T/Bell system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breakup_of_the_Bell_System)].Due to monopoly, the US authorities splitted up in different Baby Bells. One of the restriction was there was a research baby bell, they couldn't really sell anything.There were computer scientists there, who did developped some Unix interesting things.  For universities you did get the source and no support for free. How to install it, no idea. In Unité d'informatique, they were lucky: they got the same computer that unix were developped on.  They got the disk by snail mail as a post-office package. They mounted it and it did spin up and they had it.\nHere, we did have a cheaper PDP11 (DEC - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PDP-11) We go the disk source from Bell Aps but we could not run it. We could look at it but that was all, because our disc format was different than the one at Bell Aps. Somebody here did write a driver for that disk and we did compiled it in l'unité d'informatique of LLN.  it did compile it but we couldn't try it because we did not have So we find the nearest Unix system compatiblewith ours, it was in Amsterdam.  Andrew Tenebaum who did write since then a number of books about operating systems and became quite an authority. He was working there. It was the young Tanenbaum, just arriving from United States to Amsterdam. He was learning to speak dutch. We did understood his english better but his assistant insisted that he speaks dutch because he will have to pass an exam in dutch. There we got a disk, than also the one with the driver we compiled, than we got here and we start using Unix.  Than in my opinion the start of open source was Unix because we had to maintain it by ourselves and we learned a lot from the sources.\nIn that time we did had to get software and it brings us to different places. For example, at the time the agents at the custom at the airport or post didn't know what to do with the discs in terms of custom clearance. They used magnetic or xrays, we had to write on the package that it should not be x-rayed. But we got time to time unreadable discs. \n\n**So it took like weeks between the transportation, the custom...**\nYes, the custom had to clear the packages. I remember i've been in the customs in Zaventem. I had received a letter that my package from Bell Aps had arrived. I went there thinking i would have to pay something and go. But no. It had to be cleared so there wa some organisation that had to do administrative stuff, so i only got it a few days later. The response time was huge :)\n\n**Than after that period of time how did you switch from that kind of collaboration on how to make software and make software work to collaboration on networks, between universities and researchers...**\nIn the Unix system of that time there was a kind of networking protocol which only did work on serial lines.\n You could connect two unix systems together you only need a line. We had one between LLN and Leuven, it's only 15 kms, but we had to ask Belgacom, than La Régie des télégraphes et téléphones, to get a modem to connect through their network and than over that modem you could reach an amazing speed of 300 characters per second. And that was the first communication. It did happened somewhere around 85. And then you had connexion with another computer, writing something here and do  something. And we could send programs to each other. \n \n **What was the first thing you did send through a network like this?**\n I didn't do it myself, i remember it was a kind of chat program. And on LLN side was Elie Milgrom, he is retired now. On this side, it was Pr Willems. And i remember that they typed something and they got a response from the other side and that was it.  But i remember that Pr Willems sent \"ok we stop now\". And that Elie Milgrom answered \"See you later, Alligator\" [a reference to Bill Haley and the Comets].  At the time we still had these kind of songs in mind. (lol). Those Unix to Unix connexions were first. And there was a worldwide Unix to Unix based network, Usenet (1979), it still exists somewhere... you can download load  of illegal movies and that stuff, that was not what we meant at the time. But that is what is left. And Usenet became gradually replaced by the Internet in USA. In Europe, the Internet came a lot later, but we had access to the Internet, we could send mail to them and we could receive mail from them, because some friendly american university, later companies, did translate internet mail to UCP mail. That was before the 1990's.\n \n **Your relation to software had changed at the time because you did not have to do all this manipulations with the software your received... Was it already floppy discs ?**\n No, magnetic tapes, for the mainframe at least. Most of the mini-computers had some cheaper magnetic tapes. Between 90 and 95 the main machines for the software institute was a VAX from DEC. Once a year the software came from Berkeley, it was still Unix but modified by Berkeley for virtual memory and all the stuff which are common now. We received a tape, with lot of goodies, i still remember we didn't know what was on there but we scrutinised there to know what was there, what we can use.\nIn Europe, companies like Siemens were trying to set up software centers to make software avaiable, they were even trying to set up networks. Researchers did love the Internet, it worked, it was useful for their researchs. So companies in Europe, were trying to set up their own networks, i remember for example the X/OPEN transport protocol. Their was a lot of standards about what software layers should do, but it didn't succeed because sometime, 92 maybe, IBM decided to quit their own private network and to go forTCP/IP and was the switching point. Everything done for X/OPEN were suddently forgotten. For the mainframes, and certainly in Belgium computing was mainly mainframes, i'm talking about universities here, so when IBM decided to go for TCP/IP we followed even though things were really slow. For example, Belgacom was not interested in running the Domain Name System so we did it here, for some time, starting in 1993 with Pierre Verbaten (https://www.dnsbelgium.be/en/history). Belgacom were focused on X25 (DCS - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X.25) so they missed it.\n\nIt was like the french Minitel ? \nWell, at that time we were really jealous about Minitel. Could you imagine that? Terminals?  At home ? You could work home with a computer ! You could send emails ! All in one, a pc computer with a modem ! \n\nHow did the research about software evolved in the department?\nI am mainly talking about network research but here there were people working on numerical analysis, computing, artificial intelligence ... I was just not involved in those research so i don't know much about it \n\nYou were focused on software and network..\nYes, we did produce some software. We did make software to generate compilers, there was some A.I. software in Prolog, numerical analysis  libraries... Some were sold or shared, it depends.  \nWe did sell some software since the beginning i think when it was not even a department but a professor and a couple of students.\n\nIs it when you joined ? \nNo it was already a department. I did study dutch industrial engeneering in electronics. At the time in electronics you did hear something about computers, i was interested in it i wanted to know more. I heard they had started a year before a degree in computer engeneering. It was the first year where industrial engineer could join. The only thing we knew about computer were in movies. I wanted to know how it work. I'm not sure i still know now even if maybe i have some ideas...\n\nHow many langage do you know ?\nAssembly, FORTRAN, PL-1 the langage invented by IBM to be the universal one, C, Cobol. Perl, i don't know, so more. I'm not fluent in any other langages, but i can read any langage especially well writtened, i know i can understand it and learn it...I know JAVA also. As a system administrator the thing i use most are the command line of UNIX and Perl. But that's because i'm more familiar with those two so it goes faster.\n\nHow did you see the rise of personnal computer and the software that goes with ? \nI have to admit that we missed it. We didn't see that what was new was powerful. We were not impressed by the software. I remember windows 95, the news on TV, people sleeping on the street to get it. I remember when i get my first windows version, with a box of 22 floppies or so. Then i wanted to do something, to compile a program, but there was no compiler. We were used to Unix, a basic system but with a lot of utilities in it. Software was for us free, and we were used to have it free and it was not free anymore. \n\nSo, does that mean you didn't had a personnal computer until late ? \nYes. I think it was 2000.

At the time computers were mainframes and you did fed them with programms by punch cards. Programing was writing down the program, than you punched it and the next day you get results, mostly error. That's the way it worked at that time. To teach us programing, they used the langage of that time, Fortran and some kind of invented assembly langage, it didn't really exist, it was simplified.\n\nMost of the time you did write down your program, the teacher and the assistant would have to tell you what is wrong or good, you didn't had much practical experience.\n\n**How was it like, tons of pages ?** \n\nNo. As an anecdocte, i remember punchcards were a block of papers, we were jealous of the people who came in the computer center with huge stacks of cards. That were really small programs, not complicated one. The fact you had to learn to use the computer from scratch, everything was new, you couldn't rely on previous experiences, everything was new. And to start with small programs was difficult enough. \n\nThat was also the time when Edsger W. Dijkstra who forked the goto... i still remember him, in an audience, giving us a lecture on modernisation in programming at the International computing symposium 1977 in Liège (programming: from craft to scientific discipline https://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/EWD/transcriptions/EWD05xx/EWD566.html). He told usxx (i'll complete it as soon as possible. i need Jean's input)\"\n\nAnd then from 75 on, computers became cheaper and could be bought by departments and smaller entities. And than came the first interactive computer. Still beasts about two cubic meters, costing two millions belgian francs. But it was low enough to allow people to type in directly commands. I started working here in 75 as a researcher, it have evolved continuously and i saw computer getting cheaper and getting easier to use.The way to use it was simplified, you could start to go to the beast and try it out.\n\nI remember more or less: you did write down the program in Fortran for instance… We always thought in the beginning that it would work and it didn't, so after a turn around you were giving it back to the operator and you have to wait half a day or a night to get the results.\n\n**What kind of program you were working on?** \n\nI remember the first program i had to write was you got three numbers, you had to make the program decide if you construct a triangle with the numbers being the sides of the triangle.\n\n**That took an afternoon to be processed ?** \n\nWell, yeah. You had to imagine how to do it which was also one problem, than you prepare the card with the punching machine and you give the package of cards to the operator who was feeeding the computer with the cards. People had the taks to fed the computers by hands, with paper, cards, than disks and it lasts onto the magnetic disks period. And after a number of hours or a night you get a listing, a piece of paper, with the results.\n\n**When where you able to record the program onto the machine?**\n\nI think that happens between 75 and 80. After the punching cards which was already a way to record the program, we had  typewriters, terminals but we could record the programs, we could store them on the computer. We had magnetic discs. IBM had number for everything, i remember the 33-30 [manufactured from 1970 on] had a magnetic disk. We didn't touch the machines, operators would change the disks, we could only access the typewriter. That was our most direct connexion to the computer. Thetimes were diffent. The mainframes were such huge costly beasts that it had operators day and night keeping it busy. Even at night there were two or three guys mounting tapes, dismounting tapes, that kind of stuff.\nhttps://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/42/IBM_magnetic_disk_drives_3330%2B3333.png/600px-IBM_magnetic_disk_drives_3330%2B3333.png\n\n**When did you stop working with operators?** \n\nSomewhere between 85 and 90. There were still operators at the main computer of the university, but there were also small computers, so researchers and student can have direct access when needed. \n\n**When did you start to work with software sold by others or gived away in order to do your research?** \n\nYou stil need an operating system on the mainframe that was delivered by IBM or the constructor delivering the mainframe. When you bought mini-computers, which were the  smaller versions of mainframes, in most cases you did buy an operating systems, compilers and all the stuff you need to be able to program those things. In most cases, because the computer sciences department did buy the mini-computer from, for instance *digital equipment corporation*,  a manufactorer of that time, but they didn't buy their software. They were not open source or free,  but you could get Unix and could run it on those digital equipment (DEC) computers. That is what the computer department of the University of Louvain la Neuve *l'unité d'informatique*, did and so did we.\n\n**When did you start working with unix as an os?** \n\nI took a trip to Amsterdam, it must have been in 1979/80… Well, the story starts in our french sister university (LLN) where they did have a PDP-11 with Unix on it https://hackadaycom.files.wordpress.com/2016/08/full-size-pdp11.jpg. You got Unix, at the time, when you were a university, from Bell Aps (Ma Bell), the american telephone company. It was a mega organisation at the time [before the [dismantlment of AT&T/Bell system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breakup_of_the_Bell_System)].Due to monopoly, the US authorities splitted up in different Baby Bells. One of the restriction was there was a research baby bell, they couldn't really sell anything.There were computer scientists there, who did developped some Unix interesting things.  For universities you did get the source and no support for free. How to install it, no idea. In Unité d'informatique, they were lucky: they got the same computer that unix were developped on.  They got the disk by snail mail as a post-office package. They mounted it and it did spin up and they had it.\nHere, we did have a cheaper PDP11 (DEC - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PDP-11) We go the disk source from Bell Aps but we could not run it. We could look at it but that was all, because our disc format was different than the one at Bell Aps. Somebody here did write a driver for that disk and we did compiled it in l'unité d'informatique of LLN.  it did compile it but we couldn't try it because we did not have So we find the nearest Unix system compatiblewith ours, it was in Amsterdam.  Andrew Tenebaum who did write since then a number of books about operating systems and became quite an authority. He was working there. It was the young Tanenbaum, just arriving from United States to Amsterdam. He was learning to speak dutch. We did understood his english better but his assistant insisted that he speaks dutch because he will have to pass an exam in dutch. There we got a disk, than also the one with the driver we compiled, than we got here and we start using Unix.  Than in my opinion the start of open source was Unix because we had to maintain it by ourselves and we learned a lot from the sources.\nIn that time we did had to get software and it brings us to different places. For example, at the time the agents at the custom at the airport or post didn't know what to do with the discs in terms of custom clearance. They used magnetic or xrays, we had to write on the package that it should not be x-rayed. But we got time to time unreadable discs. \n\n**So it took like weeks between the transportation, the custom...**\nYes, the custom had to clear the packages. I remember i've been in the customs in Zaventem. I had received a letter that my package from Bell Aps had arrived. I went there thinking i would have to pay something and go. But no. It had to be cleared so there wa some organisation that had to do administrative stuff, so i only got it a few days later. The response time was huge :)\n\n**Than after that period of time how did you switch from that kind of collaboration on how to make software and make software work to collaboration on networks, between universities and researchers...**\nIn the Unix system of that time there was a kind of networking protocol which only did work on serial lines.\n You could connect two unix systems together you only need a line. We had one between LLN and Leuven, it's only 15 kms, but we had to ask Belgacom, than La Régie des télégraphes et téléphones, to get a modem to connect through their network and than over that modem you could reach an amazing speed of 300 characters per second. And that was the first communication. It did happened somewhere around 85. And then you had connexion with another computer, writing something here and do  something. And we could send programs to each other. \n \n **What was the first thing you did send through a network like this?**\n I didn't do it myself, i remember it was a kind of chat program. And on LLN side was Elie Milgrom, he is retired now. On this side, it was Pr Willems. And i remember that they typed something and they got a response from the other side and that was it.  But i remember that Pr Willems sent \"ok we stop now\". And that Elie Milgrom answered \"See you later, Alligator\" [a reference to Bill Haley and the Comets].  At the time we still had these kind of songs in mind. (lol). Those Unix to Unix connexions were first. And there was a worldwide Unix to Unix based network, Usenet (1979), it still exists somewhere... you can download load  of illegal movies and that stuff, that was not what we meant at the time. But that is what is left. And Usenet became gradually replaced by the Internet in USA. In Europe, the Internet came a lot later, but we had access to the Internet, we could send mail to them and we could receive mail from them, because some friendly american university, later companies, did translate internet mail to UCP mail. That was before the 1990's.\n \n **Your relation to software had changed at the time because you did not have to do all this manipulations with the software your received... Was it already floppy discs ?**\n No, magnetic tapes, for the mainframe at least. Most of the mini-computers had some cheaper magnetic tapes. Between 90 and 95 the main machines for the software institute was a VAX from DEC. Once a year the software came from Berkeley, it was still Unix but modified by Berkeley for virtual memory and all the stuff which are common now. We received a tape, with lot of goodies, i still remember we didn't know what was on there but we scrutinised there to know what was there, what we can use.\nIn Europe, companies like Siemens were trying to set up software centers to make software avaiable, they were even trying to set up networks. Researchers did love the Internet, it worked, it was useful for their researchs. So companies in Europe, were trying to set up their own networks, i remember for example the X/OPEN transport protocol. Their was a lot of standards about what software layers should do, but it didn't succeed because sometime, 92 maybe, IBM decided to quit their own private network and to go forTCP/IP and was the switching point. Everything done for X/OPEN were suddently forgotten. For the mainframes, and certainly in Belgium computing was mainly mainframes, i'm talking about universities here, so when IBM decided to go for TCP/IP we followed even though things were really slow. For example, Belgacom was not interested in running the Domain Name System so we did it here, for some time, starting in 1993 with Pierre Verbaten (https://www.dnsbelgium.be/en/history). Belgacom were focused on X25 (DCS - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X.25) so they missed it.\n\nIt was like the french Minitel ? \nWell, at that time we were really jealous about Minitel. Could you imagine that? Terminals?  At home ? You could work home with a computer ! You could send emails ! All in one, a pc computer with a modem ! \n\nHow did the research about software evolved in the department?\nI am mainly talking about network research but here there were people working on numerical analysis, computing, artificial intelligence ... I was just not involved in those research so i don't know much about it \n\nYou were focused on software and network..\nYes, we did produce some software. We did make software to generate compilers, there was some A.I. software in Prolog, numerical analysis  libraries... Some were sold or shared, it depends.  \nWe did sell some software since the beginning i think when it was not even a department but a professor and a couple of students.\n\nIs it when you joined ? \nNo it was already a department. I did study dutch industrial engeneering in electronics. At the time in electronics you did hear something about computers, i was interested in it i wanted to know more. I heard they had started a year before a degree in computer engeneering. It was the first year where industrial engineer could join. The only thing we knew about computer were in movies. I wanted to know how it work. I'm not sure i still know now even if maybe i have some ideas...\n\nHow many langage do you know ?\nAssembly, FORTRAN, PL-1 the langage invented by IBM to be the universal one, C, Cobol. Perl, i don't know, so more. I'm not fluent in any other langages, but i can read any langage especially well writtened, i know i can understand it and learn it...I know JAVA also. As a system administrator the thing i use most are the command line of UNIX and Perl. But that's because i'm more familiar with those two so it goes faster.\n\nHow did you see the rise of personnal computer and the software that goes with ? \nI have to admit that we missed it. We didn't see that what was new was powerful. We were not impressed by the software. I remember windows 95, the news on TV, people sleeping on the street to get it. I remember when i get my first windows version, with a box of 22 floppies or so. Then i wanted to do something, to compile a program, but there was no compiler. We were used to Unix, a basic system but with a lot of utilities in it. Software was for us free, and we were used to have it free and it was not free anymore. \n\nSo, does that mean you didn't had a personnal computer until late ? \nYes. I think it was round 2000. I didn't needed it really. I got one when the belgian UCP network became commercial. Of course i did not get Windows on it.  I think we got Linux here in 1994. There was a guy involved in the kernel studying here. So we did used it very fast because it

__NOPUBLISH__\n\n\n**You have been using computers since a long time, as you explained us during the tour we had the joy of assisting during the TGSO.**\n**I heard that that until recently, let's say the late 1990's, when learning computer programming you had to start by  writing down the program on paper... ** \n\nIn 1973, i did study computer sciences, it was the second year of the department, here in Leuven. At the time computers were mainframes and you did fed them with programms by punch cards. Programing was writing down the program, than you punched it and the next day you get results, mostly error. That's the way it worked at that time. To teach us programing, they used the langage of that time, Fortran and some kind of invented assembly langage, it didn't really exist, it was simplified.\n\nMost of the time you did write down your program, the teacher and the assistant would have to tell you what is wrong or good, you didn't had much practical experience.\n\n**How was it like, tons of pages ?** \n\nNo. As an anecdocte, i remember punchcards were a block of papers, we were jealous of the people who came in the computer center with huge stacks of cards. That were really small programs, not complicated one. The fact you had to learn to use the computer from scratch, everything was new, you couldn't rely on previous experiences, everything was new. And to start with small programs was difficult enough. \n\nThat was also the time when Edsger W. Dijkstra who forked the goto... i still remember him, in an audience, giving us a lecture on modernisation in programming at the International computing symposium 1977 in Liège (programming: from craft to scientific discipline https://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/EWD/transcriptions/EWD05xx/EWD566.html). He told usxx (i'll complete it as soon as possible. i need Jean's input)\"\n\nAnd then from 75 on, computers became cheaper and could be bought by departments and smaller entities. And than came the first interactive computer. Still beasts about two cubic meters, costing two millions belgian francs. But it was low enough to allow people to type in directly commands. I started working here in 75 as a researcher, it have evolved continuously and i saw computer getting cheaper and getting easier to use.The way to use it was simplified, you could start to go to the beast and try it out.\n\nI remember more or less: you did write down the program in Fortran for instance… We always thought in the beginning that it would work and it didn't, so after a turn around you were giving it back to the operator and you have to wait half a day or a night to get the results.\n\n**What kind of program you were working on?** \n\nI remember the first program i had to write was you got three numbers, you had to make the program decide if you construct a triangle with the numbers being the sides of the triangle.\n\n**That took an afternoon to be processed ?** \n\nWell, yeah. You had to imagine how to do it which was also one problem, than you prepare the card with the punching machine and you give the package of cards to the operator who was feeeding the computer with the cards. People had the taks to fed the computers by hands, with paper, cards, than disks and it lasts onto the magnetic disks period. And after a number of hours or a night you get a listing, a piece of paper, with the results.\n\n**When where you able to record the program onto the machine?**\n\nI think that happens between 75 and 80. After the punching cards which was already a way to record the program, we had  typewriters, terminals but we could record the programs, we could store them on the computer. We had magnetic discs. IBM had number for everything, i remember the 33-30 [manufactured from 1970 on] had a magnetic disk. We didn't touch the machines, operators would change the disks, we could only access the typewriter. That was our most direct connexion to the computer. Thetimes were diffent. The mainframes were such huge costly beasts that it had operators day and night keeping it busy. Even at night there were two or three guys mounting tapes, dismounting tapes, that kind of stuff.\nhttps://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/42/IBM_magnetic_disk_drives_3330%2B3333.png/600px-IBM_magnetic_disk_drives_3330%2B3333.png\n\n**When did you stop working with operators?** \n\nSomewhere between 85 and 90. There were still operators at the main computer of the university, but there were also small computers, so researchers and student can have direct access when needed. \n\n**When did you start to work with software sold by others or gived away in order to do your research?** \n\nYou stil need an operating system on the mainframe that was delivered by IBM or the constructor delivering the mainframe. When you bought mini-computers, which were the  smaller versions of mainframes, in most cases you did buy an operating systems, compilers and all the stuff you need to be able to program those things. In most cases, because the computer sciences department did buy the mini-computer from, for instance *digital equipment corporation*,  a manufactorer of that time, but they didn't buy their software. They were not open source or free,  but you could get Unix and could run it on those digital equipment (DEC) computers. That is what the computer department of the University of Louvain la Neuve *l'unité d'informatique*, did and so did we.\n\n**When did you start working with unix as an os?** \n\nI took a trip to Amsterdam, it must have been in 1979/80… Well, the story starts in our french sister university (LLN) where they did have a PDP-11 with Unix on it https://hackadaycom.files.wordpress.com/2016/08/full-size-pdp11.jpg. You got Unix, at the time, when you were a university, from Bell Aps (Ma Bell), the american telephone company. It was a mega organisation at the time [before the [dismantlment of AT&T/Bell system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breakup_of_the_Bell_System)].Due to monopoly, the US authorities splitted up in different Baby Bells. One of the restriction was there was a research baby bell, they couldn't really sell anything.There were computer scientists there, who did developped some Unix interesting things.  For universities you did get the source and no support for free. How to install it, no idea. In Unité d'informatique, they were lucky: they got the same computer that unix were developped on.  They got the disk by snail mail as a post-office package. They mounted it and it did spin up and they had it.\nHere, we did have a cheaper PDP11 (DEC - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PDP-11) We go the disk source from Bell Aps but we could not run it. We could look at it but that was all, because our disc format was different than the one at Bell Aps. Somebody here did write a driver for that disk and we did compiled it in l'unité d'informatique of LLN.  it did compile it but we couldn't try it because we did not have So we find the nearest Unix system compatiblewith ours, it was in Amsterdam.  Andrew Tenebaum who did write since then a number of books about operating systems and became quite an authority. He was working there. It was the young Tanenbaum, just arriving from United States to Amsterdam. He was learning to speak dutch. We did understood his english better but his assistant insisted that he speaks dutch because he will have to pass an exam in dutch. There we got a disk, than also the one with the driver we compiled, than we got here and we start using Unix.  Than in my opinion the start of open source was Unix because we had to maintain it by ourselves and we learned a lot from the sources.\nIn that time we did had to get software and it brings us to different places. For example, at the time the agents at the custom at the airport or post didn't know what to do with the discs in terms of custom clearance. They used magnetic or xrays, we had to write on the package that it should not be x-rayed. But we got time to time unreadable discs. \n\n**So it took like weeks between the transportation, the custom...**\nYes, the custom had to clear the packages. I remember i've been in the customs in Zaventem. I had received a letter that my package from Bell Aps had arrived. I went there thinking i would have to pay something and go. But no. It had to be cleared so there wa some organisation that had to do administrative stuff, so i only got it a few days later. The response time was huge :)\n\n**Than after that period of time how did you switch from that kind of collaboration on how to make software and make software work to collaboration on networks, between universities and researchers...**\nIn the Unix system of that time there was a kind of networking protocol which only did work on serial lines.\n You could connect two unix systems together you only need a line. We had one between LLN and Leuven, it's only 15 kms, but we had to ask Belgacom, than La Régie des télégraphes et téléphones, to get a modem to connect through their network and than over that modem you could reach an amazing speed of 300 characters per second. And that was the first communication. It did happened somewhere around 85. And then you had connexion with another computer, writing something here and do  something. And we could send programs to each other. \n \n **What was the first thing you did send through a network like this?**\n I didn't do it myself, i remember it was a kind of chat program. And on LLN side was Elie Milgrom, he is retired now. On this side, it was Pr Willems. And i remember that they typed something and they got a response from the other side and that was it.  But i remember that Pr Willems sent \"ok we stop now\". And that Elie Milgrom answered \"See you later, Alligator\" [a reference to Bill Haley and the Comets].  At the time we still had these kind of songs in mind. (lol). Those Unix to Unix connexions were first. And there was a worldwide Unix to Unix based network, Usenet (1979), it still exists somewhere... you can download load  of illegal movies and that stuff, that was not what we meant at the time. But that is what is left. And Usenet became gradually replaced by the Internet in USA. In Europe, the Internet came a lot later, but we had access to the Internet, we could send mail to them and we could receive mail from them, because some friendly american university, later companies, did translate internet mail to UCP mail. That was before the 1990's.\n \n **Your relation to software had changed at the time because you did not have to do all this manipulations with the software your received... Was it already floppy discs ?**\n No, magnetic tapes, for the mainframe at least. Most of the mini-computers had some cheaper magnetic tapes. Between 90 and 95 the main machines for the software institute was a VAX from DEC. Once a year the software came from Berkeley, it was still Unix but modified by Berkeley for virtual memory and all the stuff which are common now. We received a tape, with lot of goodies, i still remember we didn't know what was on there but we scrutinised there to know what was there, what we can use.\nIn Europe, companies like Siemens were trying to set up software centers to make software avaiable, they were even trying to set up networks. Researchers did love the Internet, it worked, it was useful for their researchs. So companies in Europe, were trying to set up their own networks, i remember for example the X/OPEN transport protocol. Their was a lot of standards about what software layers should do, but it didn't succeed because sometime, 92 maybe, IBM decided to quit their own private network and to go forTCP/IP and was the switching point. Everything done for X/OPEN were suddently forgotten. For the mainframes, and certainly in Belgium computing was mainly mainframes, i'm talking about universities here, so when IBM decided to go for TCP/IP we followed even though things were really slow. For example, Belgacom was not interested in running the Domain Name System so we did it here, for some time, starting in 1993 with Pierre Verbaten (https://www.dnsbelgium.be/en/history). Belgacom were focused on X25 (DCS - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X.25) so they missed it.\n\nIt was like the french Minitel ? \nWell, at that time we were really jealous about Minitel. Could you imagine that? Terminals?  At home ? You could work home with a computer ! You could send emails ! All in one, a pc computer with a modem ! \n\nHow did the research about software evolved in the department?\nI am mainly talking about network research but here there were people working on numerical analysis, computing, artificial intelligence ... I was just not involved in those research so i don't know much about it \n\nYou were focused on software and network..\nYes, we did produce some software. We did make software to generate compilers, there was some A.I. software in Prolog, numerical analysis  libraries... Some were sold or shared, it depends.  \nWe did sell some software since the beginning i think when it was not even a department but a professor and a couple of students.\n\nIs it when you joined ? \nNo it was already a department. I did study dutch industrial engeneering in electronics. At the time in electronics you did hear something about computers, i was interested in it i wanted to know more. I heard they had started a year before a degree in computer engeneering. It was the first year where industrial engineer could join. The only thing we knew about computer were in movies. I wanted to know how it work. I'm not sure i still know now even if maybe i have some ideas...\n\nHow many langage do you know ?\nAssembly, FORTRAN, PL-1 the langage invented by IBM to be the universal one, C, Cobol. Perl, i don't know, so more. I'm not fluent in any other langages, but i can read any langage especially well writtened, i know i can understand it and learn it...I know JAVA also. As a system administrator the thing i use most are the command line of UNIX and Perl. But that's because i'm more familiar with those two so it goes faster.\n\nHow did you see the rise of personnal computer and the software that goes with ? \nI have to admit that we missed it. We didn't see that what was new was powerful. We were not impressed by the software. I remember windows 95, the news on TV, people sleeping on the street to get it. I remember when i get my first windows version, with a box of 22 floppies or so. Then i wanted to do something, to compile a program, but there was no compiler. We were used to Unix, a basic system but with a lot of utilities in it. Software was for us free, and we were used to have it free and it was not free anymore. \n\nSo, does that mean you didn't had a personnal computer until late ? \nYes. I think it was round 2000. I didn't needed it really. I got one when the belgian UCP network became commercial. Of course i did not get Windows on it.  I think we got Linux here in 1994. There was a guy involved in the kernel studying here. So we did used it very fast.\n\nWhat is software for you ?\nFor me software is the magic that make computer usable. I can only gives examples of what i mean. A PC without sof\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","attribs":"|1+g*6|2+2*5+3p*6|1+1*5+4f*6|2+2+dm*6|2+2+4n*6|1+1|1+1*5+11*6|2+2+bc*6|2+2+5z*2+3e*3+1*4*3+20*4+1*6|2+2+e7*6|2+2+7n*6|2+2*5+1a*6|2+2+53*6|2+2*5+19*6|2+2+c7*6|2+2*5+1r*6|2+2+jo*6|1+1+41*6|2+2*5+1a*6|2+2+5g*6|2+2*5+2w*6|2+2+l6*6|2+2*5+1f*6|2+2+8f*5+7+kh*6|1+1+uu*0|1+1+9s*0|2+2*5+1v*0|1+1+aj*0|2+2*5+5m*0|1+1+30*0|1+1+48*2+15+9l*0|1+1+1*0|1+1+1*5+1y*0|1+1+tm*0|1+1+1*0|1+1*5+4t*0|1+1+dr*0|1+1+u6*0|2+2*5+x*0|1+1+5q*0|2+2*5+1q*0|1+1+5w*0|2+2*5+16*0|1+1+5b*0|1+1+3l*0|2+2*5+o*0|1+1+df*0|2+2*5+u*0|1+1+bs*0|2+2*5+29*0|1+1+eh*0|2+2*5+1w*0|1+1+7m*0|2+2*5+q*0|4+3a*6|5+5|1+1"}}},"pad:observatory.guide.jeanhuensitvextended:revs:5601":{"changeset":"Z:bnj>1|2c=bk4=36*0+1$t","meta":{"author":"a.kqv62Q3nhchdwIuK","timestamp":1518099793862}},"pad:observatory.guide.jeanhuensitvextended:revs:5602":{"changeset":"Z:bnk>2|2c=bk4=37*0+2$wa","meta":{"author":"a.kqv62Q3nhchdwIuK","timestamp":1518099794362}},"pad:observatory.guide.jeanhuensitvextended:revs:5603":{"changeset":"Z:bnm>3|2c=bk4=39*0+3$re

__NOPUBLISH__\n\n\n**You have been using computers since a long time, as you explained us during the tour we had the joy of assisting during the TGSO.**\n**I heard that that until recently, let's say the late 1990's, when learning computer programming you had to start by  writing down the program on paper... ** \n\nIn 1973, i did study computer sciences, it was the second year of the department, here in Leuven. At the time computers were mainframes and you did fed them with programms by punch cards. Programing was writing down the program, than you punched it and the next day you get results, mostly error. That's the way it worked at that time. To teach us programing, they used the langage of that time, Fortran and some kind of invented assembly langage, it didn't really exist, it was simplified.\n\nMost of the time you did write down your program, the teacher and the assistant would have to tell you what is wrong or good, you didn't had much practical experience.\n\n**How was it like, tons of pages ?** \n\nNo. As an anecdocte, i remember punchcards were a block of papers, we were jealous of the people who came in the computer center with huge stacks of cards. That were really small programs, not complicated one. The fact you had to learn to use the computer from scratch, everything was new, you couldn't rely on previous experiences, everything was new. And to start with small programs was difficult enough. \n\nThat was also the time when Edsger W. Dijkstra who forked the goto... i still remember him, in an audience, giving us a lecture on modernisation in programming at the International computing symposium 1977 in Liège (programming: from craft to scientific discipline https://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/EWD/transcriptions/EWD05xx/EWD566.html). He told usxx (i'll complete it as soon as possible. i need Jean's input)\"\n\nAnd then from 75 on, computers became cheaper and could be bought by departments and smaller entities. And than came the first interactive computer. Still beasts about two cubic meters, costing two millions belgian francs. But it was low enough to allow people to type in directly commands. I started working here in 75 as a researcher, it have evolved continuously and i saw computer getting cheaper and getting easier to use.The way to use it was simplified, you could start to go to the beast and try it out.\n\nI remember more or less: you did write down the program in Fortran for instance… We always thought in the beginning that it would work and it didn't, so after a turn around you were giving it back to the operator and you have to wait half a day or a night to get the results.\n\n**What kind of program you were working on?** \n\nI remember the first program i had to write was you got three numbers, you had to make the program decide if you construct a triangle with the numbers being the sides of the triangle.\n\n**That took an afternoon to be processed ?** \n\nWell, yeah. You had to imagine how to do it which was also one problem, than you prepare the card with the punching machine and you give the package of cards to the operator who was feeeding the computer with the cards. People had the taks to fed the computers by hands, with paper, cards, than disks and it lasts onto the magnetic disks period. And after a number of hours or a night you get a listing, a piece of paper, with the results.\n\n**When where you able to record the program onto the machine?**\n\nI think that happens between 75 and 80. After the punching cards which was already a way to record the program, we had  typewriters, terminals but we could record the programs, we could store them on the computer. We had magnetic discs. IBM had number for everything, i remember the 33-30 [manufactured from 1970 on] had a magnetic disk. We didn't touch the machines, operators would change the disks, we could only access the typewriter. That was our most direct connexion to the computer. Thetimes were diffent. The mainframes were such huge costly beasts that it had operators day and night keeping it busy. Even at night there were two or three guys mounting tapes, dismounting tapes, that kind of stuff.\nhttps://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/42/IBM_magnetic_disk_drives_3330%2B3333.png/600px-IBM_magnetic_disk_drives_3330%2B3333.png\n\n**When did you stop working with operators?** \n\nSomewhere between 85 and 90. There were still operators at the main computer of the university, but there were also small computers, so researchers and student can have direct access when needed. \n\n**When did you start to work with software sold by others or gived away in order to do your research?** \n\nYou stil need an operating system on the mainframe that was delivered by IBM or the constructor delivering the mainframe. When you bought mini-computers, which were the  smaller versions of mainframes, in most cases you did buy an operating systems, compilers and all the stuff you need to be able to program those things. In most cases, because the computer sciences department did buy the mini-computer from, for instance *digital equipment corporation*,  a manufactorer of that time, but they didn't buy their software. They were not open source or free,  but you could get Unix and could run it on those digital equipment (DEC) computers. That is what the computer department of the University of Louvain la Neuve *l'unité d'informatique*, did and so did we.\n\n**When did you start working with unix as an os?** \n\nI took a trip to Amsterdam, it must have been in 1979/80… Well, the story starts in our french sister university (LLN) where they did have a PDP-11 with Unix on it https://hackadaycom.files.wordpress.com/2016/08/full-size-pdp11.jpg. You got Unix, at the time, when you were a university, from Bell Aps (Ma Bell), the american telephone company. It was a mega organisation at the time [before the [dismantlment of AT&T/Bell system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breakup_of_the_Bell_System)].Due to monopoly, the US authorities splitted up in different Baby Bells. One of the restriction was there was a research baby bell, they couldn't really sell anything.There were computer scientists there, who did developped some Unix interesting things.  For universities you did get the source and no support for free. How to install it, no idea. In Unité d'informatique, they were lucky: they got the same computer that unix were developped on.  They got the disk by snail mail as a post-office package. They mounted it and it did spin up and they had it.\nHere, we did have a cheaper PDP11 (DEC - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PDP-11) We go the disk source from Bell Aps but we could not run it. We could look at it but that was all, because our disc format was different than the one at Bell Aps. Somebody here did write a driver for that disk and we did compiled it in l'unité d'informatique of LLN.  it did compile it but we couldn't try it because we did not have So we find the nearest Unix system compatiblewith ours, it was in Amsterdam.  Andrew Tenebaum who did write since then a number of books about operating systems and became quite an authority. He was working there. It was the young Tanenbaum, just arriving from United States to Amsterdam. He was learning to speak dutch. We did understood his english better but his assistant insisted that he speaks dutch because he will have to pass an exam in dutch. There we got a disk, than also the one with the driver we compiled, than we got here and we start using Unix.  Than in my opinion the start of open source was Unix because we had to maintain it by ourselves and we learned a lot from the sources.\nIn that time we did had to get software and it brings us to different places. For example, at the time the agents at the custom at the airport or post didn't know what to do with the discs in terms of custom clearance. They used magnetic or xrays, we had to write on the package that it should not be x-rayed. But we got time to time unreadable discs. \n\n**So it took like weeks between the transportation, the custom...**\nYes, the custom had to clear the packages. I remember i've been in the customs in Zaventem. I had received a letter that my package from Bell Aps had arrived. I went there thinking i would have to pay something and go. But no. It had to be cleared so there wa some organisation that had to do administrative stuff, so i only got it a few days later. The response time was huge :)\n\n**Than after that period of time how did you switch from that kind of collaboration on how to make software and make software work to collaboration on networks, between universities and researchers...**\nIn the Unix system of that time there was a kind of networking protocol which only did work on serial lines.\n You could connect two unix systems together you only need a line. We had one between LLN and Leuven, it's only 15 kms, but we had to ask Belgacom, than La Régie des télégraphes et téléphones, to get a modem to connect through their network and than over that modem you could reach an amazing speed of 300 characters per second. And that was the first communication. It did happened somewhere around 85. And then you had connexion with another computer, writing something here and do  something. And we could send programs to each other. \n \n **What was the first thing you did send through a network like this?**\n I didn't do it myself, i remember it was a kind of chat program. And on LLN side was Elie Milgrom, he is retired now. On this side, it was Pr Willems. And i remember that they typed something and they got a response from the other side and that was it.  But i remember that Pr Willems sent \"ok we stop now\". And that Elie Milgrom answered \"See you later, Alligator\" [a reference to Bill Haley and the Comets].  At the time we still had these kind of songs in mind. (lol). Those Unix to Unix connexions were first. And there was a worldwide Unix to Unix based network, Usenet (1979), it still exists somewhere... you can download load  of illegal movies and that stuff, that was not what we meant at the time. But that is what is left. And Usenet became gradually replaced by the Internet in USA. In Europe, the Internet came a lot later, but we had access to the Internet, we could send mail to them and we could receive mail from them, because some friendly american university, later companies, did translate internet mail to UCP mail. That was before the 1990's.\n \n **Your relation to software had changed at the time because you did not have to do all this manipulations with the software your received... Was it already floppy discs ?**\n No, magnetic tapes, for the mainframe at least. Most of the mini-computers had some cheaper magnetic tapes. Between 90 and 95 the main machines for the software institute was a VAX from DEC. Once a year the software came from Berkeley, it was still Unix but modified by Berkeley for virtual memory and all the stuff which are common now. We received a tape, with lot of goodies, i still remember we didn't know what was on there but we scrutinised there to know what was there, what we can use.\nIn Europe, companies like Siemens were trying to set up software centers to make software avaiable, they were even trying to set up networks. Researchers did love the Internet, it worked, it was useful for their researchs. So companies in Europe, were trying to set up their own networks, i remember for example the X/OPEN transport protocol. Their was a lot of standards about what software layers should do, but it didn't succeed because sometime, 92 maybe, IBM decided to quit their own private network and to go forTCP/IP and was the switching point. Everything done for X/OPEN were suddently forgotten. For the mainframes, and certainly in Belgium computing was mainly mainframes, i'm talking about universities here, so when IBM decided to go for TCP/IP we followed even though things were really slow. For example, Belgacom was not interested in running the Domain Name System so we did it here, for some time, starting in 1993 with Pierre Verbaten (https://www.dnsbelgium.be/en/history). Belgacom were focused on X25 (DCS - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X.25) so they missed it.\n\nIt was like the french Minitel ? \nWell, at that time we were really jealous about Minitel. Could you imagine that? Terminals?  At home ? You could work home with a computer ! You could send emails ! All in one, a pc computer with a modem ! \n\nHow did the research about software evolved in the department?\nI am mainly talking about network research but here there were people working on numerical analysis, computing, artificial intelligence ... I was just not involved in those research so i don't know much about it \n\nYou were focused on software and network..\nYes, we did produce some software. We did make software to generate compilers, there was some A.I. software in Prolog, numerical analysis  libraries... Some were sold or shared, it depends.  \nWe did sell some software since the beginning i think when it was not even a department but a professor and a couple of students.\n\nIs it when you joined ? \nNo it was already a department. I did study dutch industrial engeneering in electronics. At the time in electronics you did hear something about computers, i was interested in it i wanted to know more. I heard they had started a year before a degree in computer engeneering. It was the first year where industrial engineer could join. The only thing we knew about computer were in movies. I wanted to know how it work. I'm not sure i still know now even if maybe i have some ideas...\n\nHow many langage do you know ?\nAssembly, FORTRAN, PL-1 the langage invented by IBM to be the universal one, C, Cobol. Perl, i don't know, so more. I'm not fluent in any other langages, but i can read any langage especially well writtened, i know i can understand it and learn it...I know JAVA also. As a system administrator the thing i use most are the command line of UNIX and Perl. But that's because i'm more familiar with those two so it goes faster.\n\nHow did you see the rise of personnal computer and the software that goes with ? \nI have to admit that we missed it. We didn't see that what was new was powerful. We were not impressed by the software. I remember windows 95, the news on TV, people sleeping on the street to get it. I remember when i get my first windows version, with a box of 22 floppies or so. Then i wanted to do something, to compile a program, but there was no compiler. We were used to Unix, a basic system but with a lot of utilities in it. Software was for us free, and we were used to have it free and it was not free anymore. \n\nDoes that mean you didn't had a personnal computer until late ? \nYes. I think it was round 2000. I didn't needed it really. I got one when the belgian UCP network became commercial. Of course i did not get Windows on it.  I think we got Linux here in 1994. There was a guy involved in the kernel studying here. So we did used it very fast.\n\nSo, what is software for you ?\nFor me software is the magic that make computer usable. I can only gives examples of what i mean. A PC without software most people, even computer scientists, cannot do anything with it. Some software are integrated in the computer hard.  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","attribs":"|1+g*6|2+2*5+3p*6|1+1*5+4f*6|2+2+dm*6|2+2+4n*6|1+1|1+1*5+11*6|2+2+bc*6|2+2+5z*2+3e*3+1*4*3+20*4+1*6|2+2+e7*6|2+2+7n*6|2+2*5+1a*6|2+2+53*6|2+2*5+19*6|2+2+c7*6|2+2*5+1r*6|2+2+jo*6|1+1+41*6|2+2*5+1a*6|2+2+5g*6|2+2*5+2w*6|2+2+l6*6|2+2*5+1f*6|2+2+8f*5+7+kh*6|1+1+uu*0|1+1+9s*0|2+2*5+1v*0|1+1+aj*0|2+2*5+5m*0|1+1+30*0|1+1+48*2+15+9l*0|1+1+1*0|1+1+1*5+1y*0|1+1+tm*0|1+1+1*0|1+1*5+4t*0|1+1+dr*0|1+1+u6*0|2+2*5+x*0|1+1+5q*0|2+2*5+1q*0|1+1+5w*0|2+2*5+16*0|1+1+5b*0|1+1+3l*0|2+2*5+o*0|1+1+df*0|2+2*5+u*0|1+1+bs*0|2+2*5+29*0|1+1+eh*0|2+2*0*5+1*5+1r*0|1+1+7m*0|2+2*0*5+5*5+p*0|1+1+4c*0+1+t*0+1+18*0+5+2*0|3+4*6|5+5|1+1"}}},"pad:observatory.guide.jeanhuensitvextended:revs:5701":{"changeset":"Z:br0>2|2c=bk4=6k*0+2$wa","meta":{"author":"a.kqv62Q3nhchdwIuK","timestamp":1518099941763}},"pad:observatory.guide.jeanhuensitvextended:revs:5702":{"changeset":"Z:br2>2|2c=bk4=6m*0+2$re","meta":{"author":"a.kqv62Q3nhchdwIuK","timestamp":1518099942275}},"pad:observatory.guide.jeanhuensitvextended:revs:5703":{"changeset":"Z:br4>1|2c=bk4=2o*0+1$ ","meta":{"author":"a.kqv62Q3nhchdwIuK","timestamp":1518099953267}},"pad:observatory.guide.jeanhuensitvextended:revs:5704":{"changeset":"Z:br5>1|2c=bk4=2p*0+1$b","meta":{"author":"a.kqv62Q3nhchdwIuK","timestamp":1518099953768}},"pad:observatory.guide.jeanhuensitvextended:revs:5705":{"changeset":"Z:br6>2|2c=bk4=2q*0+2$y ","meta":{"author":"a.kqv62Q3nhchdwIuK","timestamp":1518099954269}},"pad:observatory.guide.jeanhuensitvextended:revs:5706":{"changeset":"Z:br8>2|2c=bk4=2s*0+2$it","meta":{"author":"a.kqv62Q3nhchdwIuK","timestamp":1518099954771}},"pad:observatory.guide.jeanhuensitvextended:revs:5707":{"changeset":"Z:bra<1|2c=bk4=4p-1$","meta":{"author":"a.kqv62Q3nhchdwIuK","timestamp":1518099962043}},"pad:observatory.guide.jeanhuensitvextended:revs:5708":{"changeset":"Z:br9<1|2c=bk4=4o-1$","meta":{"author":"a.kqv62Q3nhchdwIuK","timestamp":1518099962543}},"pad:observatory.guide.jeanhuensitvextended:revs:5709":{"changeset":"Z:br8>1|2c=bk4=4o*0+1$'","meta":{"author":"a.kqv62Q3nhchdwIuK","timestamp":1518099963209}},"pad:observatory.guide.jeanhuensitvextended:revs:571":{"changeset":"Z:59g>3|17=471=8x*0+3$ica","meta":{"author":"a.kqv62Q3nhchdwIuK","timestamp":1518089227390}},"pad:observatory.guide.jeanhuensitvextended:revs:5710":{"changeset":"Z:br9>1|2c=bk4=5c*0+1$Y","meta":{"author":"a.kqv62Q3nhchdwIuK","timestamp":1518099967337}},"pad:observatory.guide.jeanhuensitvextended:revs:5711":{"changeset":"Z:bra>3|2c=bk4=5d*0+3$ou ","meta":{"author":"a.kqv62Q3nhchdwIuK","timestamp":1518099967835}},"pad:observatory.guide.jeanhuensitvextended:revs:5712":{"changeset":"Z:brd>2|2c=bk4=5g*0+2$ne","meta":{"author":"a.kqv62Q3nhchdwIuK","timestamp":1518099968336}},"pad:observatory.guide.jeanhuensitvextended:revs:5713":{"changeset":"Z:brf>1|2c=bk4=5i*0+1$e","meta":{"author":"a.kqv62Q3nhchdwIuK","timestamp":1518099968836}},"pad:observatory.guide.jeanhuensitvextended:revs:5714":{"changeset":"Z:brg>2|2c=bk4=5j*0+2$d ","meta":{"author":"a.kqv62Q3nhchdwIuK","timestamp":1518099969339}},"pad:observatory.guide.jeanhuensitvextended:revs:5715":{"changeset":"Z:bri>2|2c=bk4=5l*0+2$so","meta":{"author":"a.kqv62Q3nhchdwIuK","timestamp":1518099969863}},"pad:observatory.guide.jeanhuensitvextended:revs:5716":{"changeset":"Z:brk>5|2c=bk4=5n*0+5$me ba","meta":{"author":"a.kqv62Q3nhchdwIuK","timestamp":1518099970363}},"pad:observatory.guide.jeanhuensitvextended:revs:5717":{"changeset":"Z:brp>2|2c=bk4=5s*0+2$si","meta":{"author":"a.kqv62Q3nhchdwIuK","timestamp":1518099970864}},"pad:observatory.guide.jeanhuensitvextended:revs:5718":{"changeset":"Z:brr>2|2c=bk4=5u*0+2$c ","meta":{"author":"a.kqv62Q3nhchdwIuK","timestamp":1518099971364}},"pad:observatory.guide.jeanhuensitvextended:revs:5719":{"changeset":"Z:brt>3|2c=bk4=5w*0+3$sof","meta":{"author":"a.kqv62Q3nhchdwIuK","timestamp":1518099971900}},"pad:observatory.guide.jeanhuensitvextended:revs:572":{"changeset":"Z:59j>2|17=471=90*0+2$n ","meta":{"author":"a.kqv62Q3nhchdwIuK","timestamp":1518089227891}},"pad:observatory.guide.jeanhuensitvextended:revs:5720":{"changeset":"Z:brw>1|2c=bk4=5z*0+1$t","meta":{"author":"a.kqv62Q3nhchdwIuK","timestamp":1518099972397}},"pad:observatory.guide.jeanhuensitvextended:revs:5721":{"changeset":"Z:brx>3|2c=bk4=60*0+3$war","meta":{"author":"a.kqv62Q3nhchdwIuK","timestamp":1518099972897}},"pad:observatory.guide.jeanhuensitvextended:revs:5722":{"changeset":"Z:bs0>3|2c=bk4=63*0+3$e.

__NOPUBLISH__\n\n\n**You have been using computers since a long time, as you explained us during the tour we had the joy of assisting during the TGSO.**\n**I heard that that until recently, let's say the late 1990's, when learning computer programming you had to start by  writing down the program on paper... ** \n\nIn 1973, i did study computer sciences, it was the second year of the department, here in Leuven. At the time computers were mainframes and you did fed them with programms by punch cards. Programing was writing down the program, than you punched it and the next day you get results, mostly error. That's the way it worked at that time. To teach us programing, they used the langage of that time, Fortran and some kind of invented assembly langage, it didn't really exist, it was simplified.\n\nMost of the time you did write down your program, the teacher and the assistant would have to tell you what is wrong or good, you didn't had much practical experience.\n\n**How was it like, tons of pages ?** \n\nNo. As an anecdocte, i remember punchcards were a block of papers, we were jealous of the people who came in the computer center with huge stacks of cards. That were really small programs, not complicated one. The fact you had to learn to use the computer from scratch, everything was new, you couldn't rely on previous experiences, everything was new. And to start with small programs was difficult enough. \n\nThat was also the time when Edsger W. Dijkstra who forked the goto... i still remember him, in an audience, giving us a lecture on modernisation in programming at the International computing symposium 1977 in Liège (programming: from craft to scientific discipline https://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/EWD/transcriptions/EWD05xx/EWD566.html). He told usxx (i'll complete it as soon as possible. i need Jean's input)\"\n\nAnd then from 75 on, computers became cheaper and could be bought by departments and smaller entities. And than came the first interactive computer. Still beasts about two cubic meters, costing two millions belgian francs. But it was low enough to allow people to type in directly commands. I started working here in 75 as a researcher, it have evolved continuously and i saw computer getting cheaper and getting easier to use.The way to use it was simplified, you could start to go to the beast and try it out.\n\nI remember more or less: you did write down the program in Fortran for instance… We always thought in the beginning that it would work and it didn't, so after a turn around you were giving it back to the operator and you have to wait half a day or a night to get the results.\n\n**What kind of program you were working on?** \n\nI remember the first program i had to write was you got three numbers, you had to make the program decide if you construct a triangle with the numbers being the sides of the triangle.\n\n**That took an afternoon to be processed ?** \n\nWell, yeah. You had to imagine how to do it which was also one problem, than you prepare the card with the punching machine and you give the package of cards to the operator who was feeeding the computer with the cards. People had the taks to fed the computers by hands, with paper, cards, than disks and it lasts onto the magnetic disks period. And after a number of hours or a night you get a listing, a piece of paper, with the results.\n\n**When where you able to record the program onto the machine?**\n\nI think that happens between 75 and 80. After the punching cards which was already a way to record the program, we had  typewriters, terminals but we could record the programs, we could store them on the computer. We had magnetic discs. IBM had number for everything, i remember the 33-30 [manufactured from 1970 on] had a magnetic disk. We didn't touch the machines, operators would change the disks, we could only access the typewriter. That was our most direct connexion to the computer. Thetimes were diffent. The mainframes were such huge costly beasts that it had operators day and night keeping it busy. Even at night there were two or three guys mounting tapes, dismounting tapes, that kind of stuff.\nhttps://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/42/IBM_magnetic_disk_drives_3330%2B3333.png/600px-IBM_magnetic_disk_drives_3330%2B3333.png\n\n**When did you stop working with operators?** \n\nSomewhere between 85 and 90. There were still operators at the main computer of the university, but there were also small computers, so researchers and student can have direct access when needed. \n\n**When did you start to work with software sold by others or gived away in order to do your research?** \n\nYou stil need an operating system on the mainframe that was delivered by IBM or the constructor delivering the mainframe. When you bought mini-computers, which were the  smaller versions of mainframes, in most cases you did buy an operating systems, compilers and all the stuff you need to be able to program those things. In most cases, because the computer sciences department did buy the mini-computer from, for instance *digital equipment corporation*,  a manufactorer of that time, but they didn't buy their software. They were not open source or free,  but you could get Unix and could run it on those digital equipment (DEC) computers. That is what the computer department of the University of Louvain la Neuve *l'unité d'informatique*, did and so did we.\n\n**When did you start working with unix as an os?** \n\nI took a trip to Amsterdam, it must have been in 1979/80… Well, the story starts in our french sister university (LLN) where they did have a PDP-11 with Unix on it https://hackadaycom.files.wordpress.com/2016/08/full-size-pdp11.jpg. You got Unix, at the time, when you were a university, from Bell Aps (Ma Bell), the american telephone company. It was a mega organisation at the time [before the [dismantlment of AT&T/Bell system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breakup_of_the_Bell_System)].Due to monopoly, the US authorities splitted up in different Baby Bells. One of the restriction was there was a research baby bell, they couldn't really sell anything.There were computer scientists there, who did developped some Unix interesting things.  For universities you did get the source and no support for free. How to install it, no idea. In Unité d'informatique, they were lucky: they got the same computer that unix were developped on.  They got the disk by snail mail as a post-office package. They mounted it and it did spin up and they had it.\nHere, we did have a cheaper PDP11 (DEC - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PDP-11) We go the disk source from Bell Aps but we could not run it. We could look at it but that was all, because our disc format was different than the one at Bell Aps. Somebody here did write a driver for that disk and we did compiled it in l'unité d'informatique of LLN.  it did compile it but we couldn't try it because we did not have So we find the nearest Unix system compatiblewith ours, it was in Amsterdam.  Andrew Tenebaum who did write since then a number of books about operating systems and became quite an authority. He was working there. It was the young Tanenbaum, just arriving from United States to Amsterdam. He was learning to speak dutch. We did understood his english better but his assistant insisted that he speaks dutch because he will have to pass an exam in dutch. There we got a disk, than also the one with the driver we compiled, than we got here and we start using Unix.  Than in my opinion the start of open source was Unix because we had to maintain it by ourselves and we learned a lot from the sources.\nIn that time we did had to get software and it brings us to different places. For example, at the time the agents at the custom at the airport or post didn't know what to do with the discs in terms of custom clearance. They used magnetic or xrays, we had to write on the package that it should not be x-rayed. But we got time to time unreadable discs. \n\n**So it took like weeks between the transportation, the custom...**\nYes, the custom had to clear the packages. I remember i've been in the customs in Zaventem. I had received a letter that my package from Bell Aps had arrived. I went there thinking i would have to pay something and go. But no. It had to be cleared so there wa some organisation that had to do administrative stuff, so i only got it a few days later. The response time was huge :)\n\n**Than after that period of time how did you switch from that kind of collaboration on how to make software and make software work to collaboration on networks, between universities and researchers...**\nIn the Unix system of that time there was a kind of networking protocol which only did work on serial lines.\n You could connect two unix systems together you only need a line. We had one between LLN and Leuven, it's only 15 kms, but we had to ask Belgacom, than La Régie des télégraphes et téléphones, to get a modem to connect through their network and than over that modem you could reach an amazing speed of 300 characters per second. And that was the first communication. It did happened somewhere around 85. And then you had connexion with another computer, writing something here and do  something. And we could send programs to each other. \n \n **What was the first thing you did send through a network like this?**\n I didn't do it myself, i remember it was a kind of chat program. And on LLN side was Elie Milgrom, he is retired now. On this side, it was Pr Willems. And i remember that they typed something and they got a response from the other side and that was it.  But i remember that Pr Willems sent \"ok we stop now\". And that Elie Milgrom answered \"See you later, Alligator\" [a reference to Bill Haley and the Comets].  At the time we still had these kind of songs in mind. (lol). Those Unix to Unix connexions were first. And there was a worldwide Unix to Unix based network, Usenet (1979), it still exists somewhere... you can download load  of illegal movies and that stuff, that was not what we meant at the time. But that is what is left. And Usenet became gradually replaced by the Internet in USA. In Europe, the Internet came a lot later, but we had access to the Internet, we could send mail to them and we could receive mail from them, because some friendly american university, later companies, did translate internet mail to UCP mail. That was before the 1990's.\n \n **Your relation to software had changed at the time because you did not have to do all this manipulations with the software your received... Was it already floppy discs ?**\n No, magnetic tapes, for the mainframe at least. Most of the mini-computers had some cheaper magnetic tapes. Between 90 and 95 the main machines for the software institute was a VAX from DEC. Once a year the software came from Berkeley, it was still Unix but modified by Berkeley for virtual memory and all the stuff which are common now. We received a tape, with lot of goodies, i still remember we didn't know what was on there but we scrutinised there to know what was there, what we can use.\nIn Europe, companies like Siemens were trying to set up software centers to make software avaiable, they were even trying to set up networks. Researchers did love the Internet, it worked, it was useful for their researchs. So companies in Europe, were trying to set up their own networks, i remember for example the X/OPEN transport protocol. Their was a lot of standards about what software layers should do, but it didn't succeed because sometime, 92 maybe, IBM decided to quit their own private network and to go forTCP/IP and was the switching point. Everything done for X/OPEN were suddently forgotten. For the mainframes, and certainly in Belgium computing was mainly mainframes, i'm talking about universities here, so when IBM decided to go for TCP/IP we followed even though things were really slow. For example, Belgacom was not interested in running the Domain Name System so we did it here, for some time, starting in 1993 with Pierre Verbaten (https://www.dnsbelgium.be/en/history). Belgacom were focused on X25 (DCS - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X.25) so they missed it.\n\nIt was like the french Minitel ? \nWell, at that time we were really jealous about Minitel. Could you imagine that? Terminals?  At home ? You could work home with a computer ! You could send emails ! All in one, a pc computer with a modem ! \n\nHow did the research about software evolved in the department?\nI am mainly talking about network research but here there were people working on numerical analysis, computing, artificial intelligence ... I was just not involved in those research so i don't know much about it \n\nYou were focused on software and network..\nYes, we did produce some software. We did make software to generate compilers, there was some A.I. software in Prolog, numerical analysis  libraries... Some were sold or shared, it depends.  \nWe did sell some software since the beginning i think when it was not even a department but a professor and a couple of students.\n\nIs it when you joined ? \nNo it was already a department. I did study dutch industrial engeneering in electronics. At the time in electronics you did hear something about computers, i was interested in it i wanted to know more. I heard they had started a year before a degree in computer engeneering. It was the first year where industrial engineer could join. The only thing we knew about computer were in movies. I wanted to know how it work. I'm not sure i still know now even if maybe i have some ideas...\n\nHow many langage do you know ?\nAssembly, FORTRAN, PL-1 the langage invented by IBM to be the universal one, C, Cobol. Perl, i don't know, so more. I'm not fluent in any other langages, but i can read any langage especially well writtened, i know i can understand it and learn it...I know JAVA also. As a system administrator the thing i use most are the command line of UNIX and Perl. But that's because i'm more familiar with those two so it goes faster.\n\nHow did you see the rise of personnal computer and the software that goes with ? \nI have to admit that we missed it. We didn't see that what was new was powerful. We were not impressed by the software. I remember windows 95, the news on TV, people sleeping on the street to get it. I remember when i get my first windows version, with a box of 22 floppies or so. Then i wanted to do something, to compile a program, but there was no compiler. We were used to Unix, a basic system but with a lot of utilities in it. Software was for us free, and we were used to have it free and it was not free anymore. \n\nDoes that mean you didn't had a personnal computer until late ? \nYes. I think it was round 2000. I didn't needed it really. I got one when the belgian UCP network became commercial. Of course i did not get Windows on it.  I think we got Linux here in 1994. There was a guy involved in the kernel studying here. So we did used it very fast.\n\nSo, what is software for you ?\nFor me software is the magic that make computer usable. I can only gives examples of what i mean by it. A PC without software most people, even computer scientists, can't do anything with it. You need some basic software. Some software are integrated in the computer hardware.  The main characteristic for me is that it should be user friendly, and that is very difficult i know, because you have to imagine what the people that will use your s\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","attribs":"|1+g*6|2+2*5+3p*6|1+1*5+4f*6|2+2+dm*6|2+2+4n*6|1+1|1+1*5+11*6|2+2+bc*6|2+2+5z*2+3e*3+1*4*3+20*4+1*6|2+2+e7*6|2+2+7n*6|2+2*5+1a*6|2+2+53*6|2+2*5+19*6|2+2+c7*6|2+2*5+1r*6|2+2+jo*6|1+1+41*6|2+2*5+1a*6|2+2+5g*6|2+2*5+2w*6|2+2+l6*6|2+2*5+1f*6|2+2+8f*5+7+kh*6|1+1+uu*0|1+1+9s*0|2+2*5+1v*0|1+1+aj*0|2+2*5+5m*0|1+1+30*0|1+1+48*2+15+9l*0|1+1+1*0|1+1+1*5+1y*0|1+1+tm*0|1+1+1*0|1+1*5+4t*0|1+1+dr*0|1+1+u6*0|2+2*5+x*0|1+1+5q*0|2+2*5+1q*0|1+1+5w*0|2+2*5+16*0|1+1+5b*0|1+1+3l*0|2+2*5+o*0|1+1+df*0|2+2*5+u*0|1+1+bs*0|2+2*5+29*0|1+1+eh*0|2+2*0*5+1*5+1r*0|1+1+7m*0|2+2*0*5+5*5+p*0|1+1+2o*0+6+1o*0+1+5*0+1+m*0+v+18*0+9+2*0|3+4q*6|5+5|1+1"}}},"pad:observatory.guide.jeanhuensitvextended:revs:5801":{"changeset":"Z:bwp>1|2c=bk4=cc*0+1$o","meta":{"author":"a.kqv62Q3nhchdwIuK","timestamp":1518100028225}},"pad:observatory.guide.jeanhuensitvextended:revs:5802":{"changeset":"Z:bwq>2|2c=bk4=cd*0+2$ft","meta":{"author":"a.kqv62Q3nhchdwIuK","timestamp":1518100028725}},"pad:observatory.guide.jeanhuensitvextended:revs:5803":{"changeset":"Z:bws>3|2c=bk4=cf*0+3$war","meta":{"author":"a.kqv62Q3nhchdwIuK","timestamp":1518100029225}},"pad:observatory.guide.jeanhuensitvextended:revs:5804":{"changeset":"Z:bwv>2|2c=bk4=ci*0+2$e

the joy of assisting during the TGSO.**\n**I heard that that until recently, let's say the late 1990's, when learning computer programming you had to start by  writing down the program on paper... ** \n\nIn 1973, i did study computer sciences, it was the second year of the department, here in Leuven. At the time computers were mainframes and you did fed them with programms by punch cards. Programing was writing down the program, than you punched it and the next day you get results, mostly error. That's the way it worked at that time. To teach us programing, they used the langage of that time, Fortran and some kind of invented assembly langage, it didn't really exist, it was simplified.\n\nMost of the time you did write down your program, the teacher and the assistant would have to tell you what is wrong or good, you didn't had much practical experience.\n\n**How was it like, tons of pages ?** \n\nNo. As an anecdocte, i remember punchcards were a block of papers, we were jealous of the people who came in the computer center with huge stacks of cards. That were really small programs, not complicated one. The fact you had to learn to use the computer from scratch, everything was new, you couldn't rely on previous experiences, everything was new. And to start with small programs was difficult enough. \n\nThat was also the time when Edsger W. Dijkstra who forked the goto... i still remember him, in an audience, giving us a lecture on modernisation in programming at the International computing symposium 1977 in Liège (programming: from craft to scientific discipline https://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/EWD/transcriptions/EWD05xx/EWD566.html). He told usxx (i'll complete it as soon as possible. i need Jean's input)\"\n\nAnd then from 75 on, computers became cheaper and could be bought by departments and smaller entities. And than came the first interactive computer. Still beasts about two cubic meters, costing two millions belgian francs. But it was low enough to allow people to type in directly commands. I started working here in 75 as a researcher, it have evolved continuously and i saw computer getting cheaper and getting easier to use.The way to use it was simplified, you could start to go to the beast and try it out.\n\nI remember more or less: you did write down the program in Fortran for instance… We always thought in the beginning that it would work and it didn't, so after a turn around you were giving it back to the operator and you have to wait half a day or a night to get the results.\n\n**What kind of program you were working on?** \n\nI remember the first program i had to write was you got three numbers, you had to make the program decide if you construct a triangle with the numbers being the sides of the triangle.\n\n**That took an afternoon to be processed ?** \n\nWell, yeah. You had to imagine how to do it which was also one problem, than you prepare the card with the punching machine and you give the package of cards to the operator who was feeeding the computer with the cards. People had the taks to fed the computers by hands, with paper, cards, than disks and it lasts onto the magnetic disks period. And after a number of hours or a night you get a listing, a piece of paper, with the results.\n\n**When where you able to record the program onto the machine?**\n\nI think that happens between 75 and 80. After the punching cards which was already a way to record the program, we had  typewriters, terminals but we could record the programs, we could store them on the computer. We had magnetic discs. IBM had number for everything, i remember the 33-30 [manufactured from 1970 on] had a magnetic disk. We didn't touch the machines, operators would change the disks, we could only access the typewriter. That was our most direct connexion to the computer. Thetimes were diffent. The mainframes were such huge costly beasts that it had operators day and night keeping it busy. Even at night there were two or three guys mounting tapes, dismounting tapes, that kind of stuff.\nhttps://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/42/IBM_magnetic_disk_drives_3330%2B3333.png/600px-IBM_magnetic_disk_drives_3330%2B3333.png\n\n**When did you stop working with operators?** \n\nSomewhere between 85 and 90. There were still operators at the main computer of the university, but there were also small computers, so researchers and student can have direct access when needed. \n\n**When did you start to work with software sold by others or gived away in order to do your research?** \n\nYou stil need an operating system on the mainframe that was delivered by IBM or the constructor delivering the mainframe. When you bought mini-computers, which were the  smaller versions of mainframes, in most cases you did buy an operating systems, compilers and all the stuff you need to be able to program those things. In most cases, because the computer sciences department did buy the mini-computer from, for instance *digital equipment corporation*,  a manufactorer of that time, but they didn't buy their software. They were not open source or free,  but you could get Unix and could run it on those digital equipment (DEC) computers. That is what the computer department of the University of Louvain la Neuve *l'unité d'informatique*, did and so did we.\n\n**When did you start working with unix as an os?** \n\nI took a trip to Amsterdam, it must have been in 1979/80… Well, the story starts in our french sister university (LLN) where they did have a PDP-11 with Unix on it https://hackadaycom.files.wordpress.com/2016/08/full-size-pdp11.jpg. You got Unix, at the time, when you were a university, from Bell Aps (Ma Bell), the american telephone company. It was a mega organisation at the time [before the [dismantlment of AT&T/Bell system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breakup_of_the_Bell_System)].Due to monopoly, the US authorities splitted up in different Baby Bells. One of the restriction was there was a research baby bell, they couldn't really sell anything.There were computer scientists there, who did developped some Unix interesting things.  For universities you did get the source and no support for free. How to install it, no idea. In Unité d'informatique, they were lucky: they got the same computer that unix were developped on.  They got the disk by snail mail as a post-office package. They mounted it and it did spin up and they had it.\nHere, we did have a cheaper PDP11 (DEC - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PDP-11) We go the disk source from Bell Aps but we could not run it. We could look at it but that was all, because our disc format was different than the one at Bell Aps. Somebody here did write a driver for that disk and we did compiled it in l'unité d'informatique of LLN.  it did compile it but we couldn't try it because we did not have So we find the nearest Unix system compatiblewith ours, it was in Amsterdam.  Andrew Tenebaum who did write since then a number of books about operating systems and became quite an authority. He was working there. It was the young Tanenbaum, just arriving from United States to Amsterdam. He was learning to speak dutch. We did understood his english better but his assistant insisted that he speaks dutch because he will have to pass an exam in dutch. There we got a disk, than also the one with the driver we compiled, than we got here and we start using Unix.  Than in my opinion the start of open source was Unix because we had to maintain it by ourselves and we learned a lot from the sources.\nIn that time we did had to get software and it brings us to different places. For example, at the time the agents at the custom at the airport or post didn't know what to do with the discs in terms of custom clearance. They used magnetic or xrays, we had to write on the package that it should not be x-rayed. But we got time to time unreadable discs. \n\n**So it took like weeks between the transportation, the custom...**\nYes, the custom had to clear the packages. I remember i've been in the customs in Zaventem. I had received a letter that my package from Bell Aps had arrived. I went there thinking i would have to pay something and go. But no. It had to be cleared so there wa some organisation that had to do administrative stuff, so i only got it a few days later. The response time was huge :)\n\n**Than after that period of time how did you switch from that kind of collaboration on how to make software and make software work to collaboration on networks, between universities and researchers...**\nIn the Unix system of that time there was a kind of networking protocol which only did work on serial lines.\n You could connect two unix systems together you only need a line. We had one between LLN and Leuven, it's only 15 kms, but we had to ask Belgacom, than La Régie des télégraphes et téléphones, to get a modem to connect through their network and than over that modem you could reach an amazing speed of 300 characters per second. And that was the first communication. It did happened somewhere around 85. And then you had connexion with another computer, writing something here and do  something. And we could send programs to each other. \n \n **What was the first thing you did send through a network like this?**\n I didn't do it myself, i remember it was a kind of chat program. And on LLN side was Elie Milgrom, he is retired now. On this side, it was Pr Willems. And i remember that they typed something and they got a response from the other side and that was it.  But i remember that Pr Willems sent \"ok we stop now\". And that Elie Milgrom answered \"See you later, Alligator\" [a reference to Bill Haley and the Comets].  At the time we still had these kind of songs in mind. (lol). Those Unix to Unix connexions were first. And there was a worldwide Unix to Unix based network, Usenet (1979), it still exists somewhere... you can download load  of illegal movies and that stuff, that was not what we meant at the time. But that is what is left. And Usenet became gradually replaced by the Internet in USA. In Europe, the Internet came a lot later, but we had access to the Internet, we could send mail to them and we could receive mail from them, because some friendly american university, later companies, did translate internet mail to UCP mail. That was before the 1990's.\n \n **Your relation to software had changed at the time because you did not have to do all this manipulations with the software your received... Was it already floppy discs ?**\n No, magnetic tapes, for the mainframe at least. Most of the mini-computers had some cheaper magnetic tapes. Between 90 and 95 the main machines for the software institute was a VAX from DEC. Once a year the software came from Berkeley, it was still Unix but modified by Berkeley for virtual memory and all the stuff which are common now. We received a tape, with lot of goodies, i still remember we didn't know what was on there but we scrutinised there to know what was there, what we can use.\nIn Europe, companies like Siemens were trying to set up software centers to make software avaiable, they were even trying to set up networks. Researchers did love the Internet, it worked, it was useful for their researchs. So companies in Europe, were trying to set up their own networks, i remember for example the X/OPEN transport protocol. Their was a lot of standards about what software layers should do, but it didn't succeed because sometime, 92 maybe, IBM decided to quit their own private network and to go forTCP/IP and was the switching point. Everything done for X/OPEN were suddently forgotten. For the mainframes, and certainly in Belgium computing was mainly mainframes, i'm talking about universities here, so when IBM decided to go for TCP/IP we followed even though things were really slow. For example, Belgacom was not interested in running the Domain Name System so we did it here, for some time, starting in 1993 with Pierre Verbaten (https://www.dnsbelgium.be/en/history). Belgacom were focused on X25 (DCS - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X.25) so they missed it.\n\nIt was like the french Minitel ? \nWell, at that time we were really jealous about Minitel. Could you imagine that? Terminals?  At home ? You could work home with a computer ! You could send emails ! All in one, a pc computer with a modem ! \n\nHow did the research about software evolved in the department?\nI am mainly talking about network research but here there were people working on numerical analysis, computing, artificial intelligence ... I was just not involved in those research so i don't know much about it \n\nYou were focused on software and network..\nYes, we did produce some software. We did make software to generate compilers, there was some A.I. software in Prolog, numerical analysis  libraries... Some were sold or shared, it depends.  \nWe did sell some software since the beginning i think when it was not even a department but a professor and a couple of students.\n\nIs it when you joined ? \nNo it was already a department. I did study dutch industrial engeneering in electronics. At the time in electronics you did hear something about computers, i was interested in it i wanted to know more. I heard they had started a year before a degree in computer engeneering. It was the first year where industrial engineer could join. The only thing we knew about computer were in movies. I wanted to know how it work. I'm not sure i still know now even if maybe i have some ideas...\n\nHow many langage do you know ?\nAssembly, FORTRAN, PL-1 the langage invented by IBM to be the universal one, C, Cobol. Perl, i don't know, so more. I'm not fluent in any other langages, but i can read any langage especially well writtened, i know i can understand it and learn it...I know JAVA also. As a system administrator the thing i use most are the command line of UNIX and Perl. But that's because i'm more familiar with those two so it goes faster.\n\nHow did you see the rise of personnal computer and the software that goes with ? \nI have to admit that we missed it. We didn't see that what was new was powerful. We were not impressed by the software. I remember windows 95, the news on TV, people sleeping on the street to get it. I remember when i get my first windows version, with a box of 22 floppies or so. Then i wanted to do something, to compile a program, but there was no compiler. We were used to Unix, a basic system but with a lot of utilities in it. Software was for us free, and we were used to have it free and it was not free anymore. \n\nDoes that mean you didn't had a personnal computer until late ? \nYes. I think it was round 2000. I didn't needed it really. I got one when the belgian UCP network became commercial. Of course i did not get Windows on it.  I think we got Linux here in 1994. There was a guy involved in the kernel studying here. So we did used it very fast.\n\nSo, what is software for you ?\nFor me software is the magic that make computer usable. I can only gives examples of what i mean by it. A PC without software most people, even computer scientists, can't do anything with it. You need basic software. Some software are already integrated in the computer hardware.  The main characteristic, for me, is that it should be user friendly. That is very difficult i know, because you have to imagine what the people using your software are going to do with it and how they want to use it, that's the magic you need to solve.\n\nyou can creat loops, It's not computer langages like C or \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","attribs":"|1+g*6|2+2*5+3p*6|1+1*5+4f*6|2+2+dm*6|2+2+4n*6|1+1|1+1*5+11*6|2+2+bc*6|2+2+5z*2+3e*3+1*4*3+20*4+1*6|2+2+e7*6|2+2+7n*6|2+2*5+1a*6|2+2+53*6|2+2*5+19*6|2+2+c7*6|2+2*5+1r*6|2+2+jo*6|1+1+41*6|2+2*5+1a*6|2+2+5g*6|2+2*5+2w*6|2+2+l6*6|2+2*5+1f*6|2+2+8f*5+7+kh*6|1+1+uu*0|1+1+9s*0|2+2*5+1v*0|1+1+aj*0|2+2*5+5m*0|1+1+30*0|1+1+48*2+15+9l*0|1+1+1*0|1+1+1*5+1y*0|1+1+tm*0|1+1+1*0|1+1*5+4t*0|1+1+dr*0|1+1+u6*0|2+2*5+x*0|1+1+5q*0|2+2*5+1q*0|1+1+5w*0|2+2*5+16*0|1+1+5b*0|1+1+3l*0|2+2*5+o*0|1+1+df*0|2+2*5+u*0|1+1+bs*0|2+2*5+29*0|1+1+eh*0|2+2*5+1s*0|1+1+7m*0|2+2*5+u*0|1+1+et*0|4+1q*6|5+5|1+1"}}},"pad:observatory.guide.jeanhuensitvextended:revs:5901":{"changeset":"Z:c0t>3|2e=byz=1m*0+3$wha","meta":{"author":"a.kqv62Q3nhchdwIuK","timestamp":1518100216903}},"pad:observatory.guide.jeanhuensitvextended:revs:5902":{"changeset":"Z:c0w>2|2e=byz=1p*0+2$te","meta":{"author":"a.kqv62Q3nhchdwIuK","timestamp":1518100217403}},"pad:observatory.guide.jeanhuensitvextended:revs:5903":{"changeset":"Z:c0y>3|2e=byz=1r*0+3$ver","meta":{"author":"a.kqv62Q3nhchdwIuK","timestamp":1518100217905}},"pad:observatory.guide.jeanhuensitvextended:revs:5904":{"changeset":"Z:c11>2|2e=byz=1u*0+2$.

There were still operators at the main computer of the university, but there were also small computers, so researchers and student can have direct access when needed. \n\n**When did you start to work with software sold by others or gived away in order to do your research?** \n\nYou stil need an operating system on the mainframe that was delivered by IBM or the constructor delivering the mainframe. When you bought mini-computers, which were the  smaller versions of mainframes, in most cases you did buy an operating systems, compilers and all the stuff you need to be able to program those things. In most cases, because the computer sciences department did buy the mini-computer from, for instance *digital equipment corporation*,  a manufactorer of that time, but they didn't buy their software. They were not open source or free,  but you could get Unix and could run it on those digital equipment (DEC) computers. That is what the computer department of the University of Louvain la Neuve *l'unité d'informatique*, did and so did we.\n\n**When did you start working with unix as an os?** \n\nI took a trip to Amsterdam, it must have been in 1979/80… Well, the story starts in our french sister university (LLN) where they did have a PDP-11 with Unix on it https://hackadaycom.files.wordpress.com/2016/08/full-size-pdp11.jpg. You got Unix, at the time, when you were a university, from Bell Aps (Ma Bell), the american telephone company. It was a mega organisation at the time [before the [dismantlment of AT&T/Bell system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breakup_of_the_Bell_System)]. They splitted up in different Baby Bells. One of the restriction was there wThey couldn't sell it really. For unvirsities you did get the source and no support. How to install it ,no idea. We got the same computer that unix were developped on.  In LLN, They got the disk by snail mail as a post-office package \nHere, we did have a cheaper PDP11 (DEC - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PDP-11) We go the disk but we could not run it. Somebody here did write a driver for that disk in l'unité d'informatique of LLN.  The nearest place was in Amsterdam.  Andrew Tenebaum who did write a number of books on operating systems was working there. It was the young Tanenbaum, just arriving from United States to Amsterdam. He was learning to speak dutch. We did understood his english better but his assistant insisted that he speaks dutch because he will have to pass an exam in dutch.\nWe got a disk with, that disk we got here and we start using Unix.\n\n\n\n\n\n","attribs":"|1+g*6|2+2*5+3p*6|1+1*5+4f*6|2+2+dm*6|2+2+4n*6|1+1|1+1*5+11*6|2+2+bc*6|2+2+5z*2+3e*3+1*4*3+20*4+1*6|2+2+e7*6|2+2+7n*6|2+2*5+1a*6|2+2+53*6|2+2*5+19*6|2+2+c7*6|2+2*5+1r*6|2+2+jo*6|1+1+41*6|2+2*5+1a*6|2+2+5g*6|2+2*5+2w*6|2+2+l6*6|2+2*5+1f*6|2+2+4j*0+1w+20*5+7+1*0+w+5a*0+y+6i*6|1+1*2+fo*6|1+1*2+1u*6|5+5|1+1"}}},"pad:observatory.guide.jeanhuensitvextended:revs:6000":{"changeset":"Z:c57>1|2f=c0n=1e*0+1$e","meta":{"author":"a.kqv62Q3nhchdwIuK","timestamp":1518100346112,"atext":{"text":"% __NOPUBLISH__\n\n\n**You have been using computers since a long time, as you explained us during the tour we had the joy of assisting during the TGSO.**\n**I heard that that until recently, let's say the late 1990's, when learning computer programming you had to start by  writing down the program on paper... ** \n\nIn 1973, i did study computer sciences, it was the second year of the department, here in Leuven.

It was a mega organisation at the time [before the [dismantlment of AT&T/Bell system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breakup_of_the_Bell_System)].Due to monopoly, the US authorities splitted up in different Baby Bells. One of the restriction was there was a research baby bell, they couldn't really sell anything.There were computer scientists there, who did developped some Unix interesting things.  For universities you did get the source and no support for free. How to install it, no idea. In Unité d'informatique, they were lucky: they got the same computer that unix were developped on.  They got the disk by snail mail as a post-office package. They mounted it and it did spin up and they had it.\nHere, we did have a cheaper PDP11 (DEC - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PDP-11) We go the disk source from Bell Aps but we could not run it. We could look at it but that was all, because our disc format was different than the one at Bell Aps. Somebody here did write a driver for that disk and we did compiled it in l'unité d'informatique of LLN.  it did compile it but we couldn't try it because we did not have So we find the nearest Unix system compatiblewith ours, it was in Amsterdam.  Andrew Tenebaum who did write since then a number of books about operating systems and became quite an authority. He was working there. It was the young Tanenbaum, just arriving from United States to Amsterdam. He was learning to speak dutch. We did understood his english better but his assistant insisted that he speaks dutch because he will have to pass an exam in dutch. There we got a disk, than also the one with the driver we compiled, than we got here and we start using Unix.  Than in my opinion the start of open source was Unix because we had to maintain it by ourselves and we learned a lot from the sources.\nIn that time we did had to get software and it brings us to different places. For example, at the time the agents at the custom at the airport or post didn't know what to do with the discs in terms of custom clearance. They used magnetic or xrays, we had to write on the package that it should not be x-rayed. But we got time to time unreadable discs. \n\n**So it took like weeks between the transportation, the custom...**\nYes, the custom had to clear the packages. I remember i've been in the customs in Zaventem. I had received a letter that my package from Bell Aps had arrived. I went there thinking i would have to pay something and go. But no. It had to be cleared so there wa some organisation that had to do administrative stuff, so i only got it a few days later. The response time was huge :)\n\n**Than after that period of time how did you switch from that kind of collaboration on how to make software and make software work to collaboration on networks, between universities and researchers...**\nIn the Unix system of that time there was a kind of networking protocol which only did work on serial lines.\n You could connect two unix systems together you only need a line. We had one between LLN and Leuven, it's only 15 kms, but we had to ask Belgacom, than La Régie des télégraphes et téléphones, to get a modem to connect through their network and than over that modem you could reach an amazing speed of 300 characters per second. And that was the first communication. It did happened somewhere around 85. And then you had connexion with another computer, writing something here and do  something. And we could send programs to each other. \n \n **What was the first thing you did send through a network like this?**\n I didn't do it myself, i remember it was a kind of chat program. And on LLN side was Elie Milgrom, he is retired now. On this side, it was Pr Willems. And i remember that they typed something and they got a response from the other side and that was it.  But i remember that Pr Willems sent \"ok we stop now\". And that Elie Milgrom answered \"See you later, Alligator\" [a reference to Bill Haley and the Comets].  At the time we still had these kind of songs in mind. (lol). Those Unix to Unix connexions were first. And there was a worldwide Unix to Unix based network, Usenet (1979), it still exists somewhere... you can download load  of illegal movies and that stuff, that was not what we meant at the time. But that is what is left. And Usenet became gradually replaced by the Internet in USA. In Europe, the Internet came a lot later, but we had access to the Internet, we could send mail to them and we could receive mail from them, because some friendly american university, later companies, did translate internet mail to UCP mail. That was before the 1990's.\n \n **Your relation to software had changed at the time because you did not have to do all this manipulations with the software your received... Was it already floppy discs ?**\n No, magnetic tapes, for the mainframe at least. Most of the mini-computers had some cheaper magnetic tapes. Between 90 and 95 the main machines for the software institute was a VAX from DEC. Once a year the software came from Berkeley, it was still Unix but modified by Berkeley for virtual memory and all the stuff which are common now. We received a tape, with lot of goodies, i still remember we didn't know what was on there but we scrutinised there to know what was there, what we can use.\nIn Europe, companies like Siemens were trying to set up software centers to make software avaiable, they were even trying to set up networks. Researchers did love the Internet, it worked, it was useful for their researchs. So companies in Europe, were trying to set up their own networks, i remember for example the X/OPEN transport protocol. Their was a lot of standards about what software layers should do, but it didn't succeed because sometime, 92 maybe, IBM decided to quit their own private network and to go forTCP/IP and was the switching point. Everything done for X/OPEN were suddently forgotten. For the mainframes, and certainly in Belgium computing was mainly mainframes, i'm talking about universities here, so when IBM decided to go for TCP/IP we followed even though things were really slow. For example, Belgacom was not interested in running the Domain Name System so we did it here, for some time, starting in 1993 with Pierre Verbaten (https://www.dnsbelgium.be/en/history). Belgacom were focused on X25 (DCS - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X.25) so they missed it.\n\nIt was like the french Minitel ? \nWell, at that time we were really jealous about Minitel. Could you imagine that? Terminals?  At home ? You could work home with a computer ! You could send emails ! All in one, a pc computer with a modem ! \n\nHow did the research about software evolved in the department?\nI am mainly talking about network research but here there were people working on numerical analysis, computing, artificial intelligence ... I was just not involved in those research so i don't know much about it \n\nYou were focused on software and network..\nYes, we did produce some software. We did make software to generate compilers, there was some A.I. software in Prolog, numerical analysis  libraries... Some were sold or shared, it depends.  \nWe did sell some software since the beginning i think when it was not even a department but a professor and a couple of students.\n\nIs it when you joined ? \nNo it was already a department. I did study dutch industrial engeneering in electronics. At the time in electronics you did hear something about computers, i was interested in it i wanted to know more. I heard they had started a year before a degree in computer engeneering. It was the first year where industrial engineer could join. The only thing we knew about computer were in movies. I wanted to know how it work. I'm not sure i still know now even if maybe i have some ideas...\n\nHow many langage do you know ?\nAssembly, FORTRAN, PL-1 the langage invented by IBM to be the universal one, C, Cobol. Perl, i don't know, so more. I'm not fluent in any other langages, but i can read any langage especially well writtened, i know i can understand it and learn it...I know JAVA also. As a system administrator the thing i use most are the command line of UNIX and Perl. But that's because i'm more familiar with those two so it goes faster.\n\nHow did you see the rise of personnal computer and the software that goes with ? \nI have to admit that we missed it. We didn't see that what was new was powerful. We were not impressed by the software. I remember windows 95, the news on TV, people sleeping on the street to get it. I remember when i get my first windows version, with a box of 22 floppies or so. Then i wanted to do something, to compile a program, but there was no compiler. We were used to Unix, a basic system but with a lot of utilities in it. Software was for us free, and we were used to have it free and it was not free anymore. \n\nDoes that mean you didn't had a personnal computer until late ? \nYes. I think it was round 2000. I didn't needed it really. I got one when the belgian UCP network became commercial. Of course i did not get Windows on it.  I think we got Linux here in 1994. There was a guy involved in the kernel studying here. So we did used it very fast.\n\nSo, what is software for you ?\nFor me software is the magic that make computer usable. I can only gives examples of what i mean by it. A PC without software most people, even computer scientists, can't do anything with it. You need basic software. Some software are already integrated in the computer hardware. Same for phones, tablets... The main characteristic, for me, is that it should be user friendly. That is very difficult i know, because you have to imagine what the people using your software are going to do with it and how they want to use it, that's the magic you need to solve.\n\nIs command line user friendly ? \nWell, somehow you have to learn the command langage\nYou can creat loops, it's not computer langages like C or whatever. \n\nBut it's already software no ?\nYes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","attribs":"|1+g*6|2+2*5+3p*6|1+1*5+4f*6|2+2+dm*6|2+2+4n*6|1+1|1+1*5+11*6|2+2+bc*6|2+2+5z*2+3e*3+1*4*3+20*4+1*6|2+2+e7*6|2+2+7n*6|2+2*5+1a*6|2+2+53*6|2+2*5+19*6|2+2+c7*6|2+2*5+1r*6|2+2+jo*6|1+1+41*6|2+2*5+1a*6|2+2+5g*6|2+2*5+2w*6|2+2+l6*6|2+2*5+1f*6|2+2+8f*5+7+kh*6|1+1+uu*0|1+1+9s*0|2+2*5+1v*0|1+1+aj*0|2+2*5+5m*0|1+1+30*0|1+1+48*2+15+9l*0|1+1+1*0|1+1+1*5+1y*0|1+1+tm*0|1+1+1*0|1+1*5+4t*0|1+1+dr*0|1+1+u6*0|2+2*5+x*0|1+1+5q*0|2+2*5+1q*0|1+1+5w*0|2+2*5+16*0|1+1+5b*0|1+1+3l*0|2+2*5+o*0|1+1+df*0|2+2*5+u*0|1+1+bs*0|2+2*5+29*0|1+1+eh*0|2+2*5+1s*0|1+1+7m*0|2+2*5+u*0|1+1+7s*0+r+71*0|2+2*0*5+w*0|4+3f*0*5+u*0|3+7*6|5+5|1+1"}}},"pad:observatory.guide.jeanhuensitvextended:revs:6001":{"changeset":"Z:c58>2|2f=c0n=1f*0+2$

__NOPUBLISH__\n\n\n**You have been using computers since a long time, as you explained us during the tour we had the joy of assisting during the TGSO.**\n**I heard that that until recently, let's say the late 1990's, when learning computer programming you had to start by  writing down the program on paper... ** \n\nIn 1973, i did study computer sciences, it was the second year of the department, here in Leuven. At the time computers were mainframes and you did fed them with programms by punch cards. Programing was writing down the program, than you punched it and the next day you get results, mostly error. That's the way it worked at that time. To teach us programing, they used the langage of that time, Fortran and some kind of invented assembly langage, it didn't really exist, it was simplified.\n\nMost of the time you did write down your program, the teacher and the assistant would have to tell you what is wrong or good, you didn't had much practical experience.\n\n**How was it like, tons of pages ?** \n\nNo. As an anecdocte, i remember punchcards were a block of papers, we were jealous of the people who came in the computer center with huge stacks of cards. That were really small programs, not complicated one. The fact you had to learn to use the computer from scratch, everything was new, you couldn't rely on previous experiences, everything was new. And to start with small programs was difficult enough. \n\nThat was also the time when Edsger W. Dijkstra who forked the goto... i still remember him, in an audience, giving us a lecture on modernisation in programming at the International computing symposium 1977 in Liège (programming: from craft to scientific discipline https://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/EWD/transcriptions/EWD05xx/EWD566.html). He told usxx (i'll complete it as soon as possible. i need Jean's input)\"\n\nAnd then from 75 on, computers became cheaper and could be bought by departments and smaller entities. And than came the first interactive computer. Still beasts about two cubic meters, costing two millions belgian francs. But it was low enough to allow people to type in directly commands. I started working here in 75 as a researcher, it have evolved continuously and i saw computer getting cheaper and getting easier to use.The way to use it was simplified, you could start to go to the beast and try it out.\n\nI remember more or less: you did write down the program in Fortran for instance… We always thought in the beginning that it would work and it didn't, so after a turn around you were giving it back to the operator and you have to wait half a day or a night to get the results.\n\n**What kind of program you were working on?** \n\nI remember the first program i had to write was you got three numbers, you had to make the program decide if you construct a triangle with the numbers being the sides of the triangle.\n\n**That took an afternoon to be processed ?** \n\nWell, yeah. You had to imagine how to do it which was also one problem, than you prepare the card with the punching machine and you give the package of cards to the operator who was feeeding the computer with the cards. People had the taks to fed the computers by hands, with paper, cards, than disks and it lasts onto the magnetic disks period. And after a number of hours or a night you get a listing, a piece of paper, with the results.\n\n**When where you able to record the program onto the machine?**\n\nI think that happens between 75 and 80. After the punching cards which was already a way to record the program, we had  typewriters, terminals but we could record the programs, we could store them on the computer. We had magnetic discs. IBM had number for everything, i remember the 33-30 [manufactured from 1970 on] had a magnetic disk. We didn't touch the machines, operators would change the disks, we could only access the typewriter. That was our most direct connexion to the computer. Thetimes were diffent. The mainframes were such huge costly beasts that it had operators day and night keeping it busy. Even at night there were two or three guys mounting tapes, dismounting tapes, that kind of stuff.\nhttps://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/42/IBM_magnetic_disk_drives_3330%2B3333.png/600px-IBM_magnetic_disk_drives_3330%2B3333.png\n\n**When did you stop working with operators?** \n\nSomewhere between 85 and 90. There were still operators at the main computer of the university, but there were also small computers, so researchers and student can have direct access when needed. \n\n**When did you start to work with software sold by others or gived away in order to do your research?** \n\nYou stil need an operating system on the mainframe that was delivered by IBM or the constructor delivering the mainframe. When you bought mini-computers, which were the  smaller versions of mainframes, in most cases you did buy an operating systems, compilers and all the stuff you need to be able to program those things. In most cases, because the computer sciences department did buy the mini-computer from, for instance *digital equipment corporation*,  a manufactorer of that time, but they didn't buy their software. They were not open source or free,  but you could get Unix and could run it on those digital equipment (DEC) computers. That is what the computer department of the University of Louvain la Neuve *l'unité d'informatique*, did and so did we.\n\n**When did you start working with unix as an os?** \n\nI took a trip to Amsterdam, it must have been in 1979/80… Well, the story starts in our french sister university (LLN) where they did have a PDP-11 with Unix on it https://hackadaycom.files.wordpress.com/2016/08/full-size-pdp11.jpg. You got Unix, at the time, when you were a university, from Bell Aps (Ma Bell), the american telephone company. It was a mega organisation at the time [before the [dismantlment of AT&T/Bell system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breakup_of_the_Bell_System)].Due to monopoly, the US authorities splitted up in different Baby Bells. One of the restriction was there was a research baby bell, they couldn't really sell anything.There were computer scientists there, who did developped some Unix interesting things.  For universities you did get the source and no support for free. How to install it, no idea. In Unité d'informatique, they were lucky: they got the same computer that unix were developped on.  They got the disk by snail mail as a post-office package. They mounted it and it did spin up and they had it.\nHere, we did have a cheaper PDP11 (DEC - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PDP-11) We go the disk source from Bell Aps but we could not run it. We could look at it but that was all, because our disc format was different than the one at Bell Aps. Somebody here did write a driver for that disk and we did compiled it in l'unité d'informatique of LLN.  it did compile it but we couldn't try it because we did not have So we find the nearest Unix system compatiblewith ours, it was in Amsterdam.  Andrew Tenebaum who did write since then a number of books about operating systems and became quite an authority. He was working there. It was the young Tanenbaum, just arriving from United States to Amsterdam. He was learning to speak dutch. We did understood his english better but his assistant insisted that he speaks dutch because he will have to pass an exam in dutch. There we got a disk, than also the one with the driver we compiled, than we got here and we start using Unix.  Than in my opinion the start of open source was Unix because we had to maintain it by ourselves and we learned a lot from the sources.\nIn that time we did had to get software and it brings us to different places. For example, at the time the agents at the custom at the airport or post didn't know what to do with the discs in terms of custom clearance. They used magnetic or xrays, we had to write on the package that it should not be x-rayed. But we got time to time unreadable discs. \n\n**So it took like weeks between the transportation, the custom...**\nYes, the custom had to clear the packages. I remember i've been in the customs in Zaventem. I had received a letter that my package from Bell Aps had arrived. I went there thinking i would have to pay something and go. But no. It had to be cleared so there wa some organisation that had to do administrative stuff, so i only got it a few days later. The response time was huge :)\n\n**Than after that period of time how did you switch from that kind of collaboration on how to make software and make software work to collaboration on networks, between universities and researchers...**\nIn the Unix system of that time there was a kind of networking protocol which only did work on serial lines.\n You could connect two unix systems together you only need a line. We had one between LLN and Leuven, it's only 15 kms, but we had to ask Belgacom, than La Régie des télégraphes et téléphones, to get a modem to connect through their network and than over that modem you could reach an amazing speed of 300 characters per second. And that was the first communication. It did happened somewhere around 85. And then you had connexion with another computer, writing something here and do  something. And we could send programs to each other. \n \n **What was the first thing you did send through a network like this?**\n I didn't do it myself, i remember it was a kind of chat program. And on LLN side was Elie Milgrom, he is retired now. On this side, it was Pr Willems. And i remember that they typed something and they got a response from the other side and that was it.  But i remember that Pr Willems sent \"ok we stop now\". And that Elie Milgrom answered \"See you later, Alligator\" [a reference to Bill Haley and the Comets].  At the time we still had these kind of songs in mind. (lol). Those Unix to Unix connexions were first. And there was a worldwide Unix to Unix based network, Usenet (1979), it still exists somewhere... you can download load  of illegal movies and that stuff, that was not what we meant at the time. But that is what is left. And Usenet became gradually replaced by the Internet in USA. In Europe, the Internet came a lot later, but we had access to the Internet, we could send mail to them and we could receive mail from them, because some friendly american university, later companies, did translate internet mail to UCP mail. That was before the 1990's.\n \n **Your relation to software had changed at the time because you did not have to do all this manipulations with the software your received... Was it already floppy discs ?**\n No, magnetic tapes, for the mainframe at least. Most of the mini-computers had some cheaper magnetic tapes. Between 90 and 95 the main machines for the software institute was a VAX from DEC. Once a year the software came from Berkeley, it was still Unix but modified by Berkeley for virtual memory and all the stuff which are common now. We received a tape, with lot of goodies, i still remember we didn't know what was on there but we scrutinised there to know what was there, what we can use.\nIn Europe, companies like Siemens were trying to set up software centers to make software avaiable, they were even trying to set up networks. Researchers did love the Internet, it worked, it was useful for their researchs. So companies in Europe, were trying to set up their own networks, i remember for example the X/OPEN transport protocol. Their was a lot of standards about what software layers should do, but it didn't succeed because sometime, 92 maybe, IBM decided to quit their own private network and to go forTCP/IP and was the switching point. Everything done for X/OPEN were suddently forgotten. For the mainframes, and certainly in Belgium computing was mainly mainframes, i'm talking about universities here, so when IBM decided to go for TCP/IP we followed even though things were really slow. For example, Belgacom was not interested in running the Domain Name System so we did it here, for some time, starting in 1993 with Pierre Verbaten (https://www.dnsbelgium.be/en/history). Belgacom were focused on X25 (DCS - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X.25) so they missed it.\n\nIt was like the french Minitel ? \nWell, at that time we were really jealous about Minitel. Could you imagine that? Terminals?  At home ? You could work home with a computer ! You could send emails ! All in one, a pc computer with a modem ! \n\nHow did the research about software evolved in the department?\nI am mainly talking about network research but here there were people working on numerical analysis, computing, artificial intelligence ... I was just not involved in those research so i don't know much about it \n\nYou were focused on software and network..\nYes, we did produce some software. We did make software to generate compilers, there was some A.I. software in Prolog, numerical analysis  libraries... Some were sold or shared, it depends.  \nWe did sell some software since the beginning i think when it was not even a department but a professor and a couple of students.\n\nIs it when you joined ? \nNo it was already a department. I did study dutch industrial engeneering in electronics. At the time in electronics you did hear something about computers, i was interested in it i wanted to know more. I heard they had started a year before a degree in computer engeneering. It was the first year where industrial engineer could join. The only thing we knew about computer were in movies. I wanted to know how it work. I'm not sure i still know now even if maybe i have some ideas...\n\nHow many langage do you know ?\nAssembly, FORTRAN, PL-1 the langage invented by IBM to be the universal one, C, Cobol. Perl, i don't know, so more. I'm not fluent in any other langages, but i can read any langage especially well writtened, i know i can understand it and learn it...I know JAVA also. As a system administrator the thing i use most are the command line of UNIX and Perl. But that's because i'm more familiar with those two so it goes faster.\n\nHow did you see the rise of personnal computer and the software that goes with ? \nI have to admit that we missed it. We didn't see that what was new was powerful. We were not impressed by the software. I remember windows 95, the news on TV, people sleeping on the street to get it. I remember when i get my first windows version, with a box of 22 floppies or so. Then i wanted to do something, to compile a program, but there was no compiler. We were used to Unix, a basic system but with a lot of utilities in it. Software was for us free, and we were used to have it free and it was not free anymore. \n\nDoes that mean you didn't had a personnal computer until late ? \nYes. I think it was round 2000. I didn't needed it really. I got one when the belgian UCP network became commercial. Of course i did not get Windows on it.  I think we got Linux here in 1994. There was a guy involved in the kernel studying here. So we did used it very fast.\n\nSo, what is software for you ?\nFor me software is the magic that make computer usable. I can only gives examples of what i mean by it. A PC without software most people, even computer scientists, can't do anything with it. You need basic software. Some software are already integrated in the computer hardware. Same for phones, tablets... The main characteristic, for me, is that it should be user friendly. That is very difficult i know, because you have to imagine what the people using your software are going to do with it and how they want to use it, that's the magic you need to solve.\n\nIs command line user friendly ? \nWell, somehow you have to learn the command langage that is in fact a computer langage where you can make all the constructs that other langages offers.\nYou can create loops, you can test, whatever. It's not so different from computer langages like C or JAVA or whatever. \n\nBut it's already software no ?\nYes. But i don't have a strong opinion about com\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","attribs":"|1+g*6|2+2*5+3p*6|1+1*5+4f*6|2+2+dm*6|2+2+4n*6|1+1|1+1*5+11*6|2+2+bc*6|2+2+5z*2+3e*3+1*4*3+20*4+1*6|2+2+e7*6|2+2+7n*6|2+2*5+1a*6|2+2+53*6|2+2*5+19*6|2+2+c7*6|2+2*5+1r*6|2+2+jo*6|1+1+41*6|2+2*5+1a*6|2+2+5g*6|2+2*5+2w*6|2+2+l6*6|2+2*5+1f*6|2+2+8f*5+7+kh*6|1+1+uu*0|1+1+9s*0|2+2*5+1v*0|1+1+aj*0|2+2*5+5m*0|1+1+30*0|1+1+48*2+15+9l*0|1+1+1*0|1+1+1*5+1y*0|1+1+tm*0|1+1+1*0|1+1*5+4t*0|1+1+dr*0|1+1+u6*0|2+2*5+x*0|1+1+5q*0|2+2*5+1q*0|1+1+5w*0|2+2*5+16*0|1+1+5b*0|1+1+3l*0|2+2*5+o*0|1+1+df*0|2+2*5+u*0|1+1+bs*0|2+2*5+29*0|1+1+eh*0|2+2*5+1s*0|1+1+7m*0|2+2*5+u*0|1+1+7s*0+r+71*0|2+2*0*5+w*0|4+7n*0*5+u*0|5+1h*6|5+5|1+1"}}},"pad:observatory.guide.jeanhuensitvextended:revs:6101":{"changeset":"Z:caq>4|2j=c94=1c*0+4$mand","meta":{"author":"a.kqv62Q3nhchdwIuK","timestamp":1518100576936}},"pad:observatory.guide.jeanhuensitvextended:revs:6102":{"changeset":"Z:cau>2|2j=c94=1g*0+2$

__NOPUBLISH__\n\n\n**You have been using computers since a long time, as you explained us during the tour we had the joy of assisting during the TGSO.**\n**I heard that that until recently, let's say the late 1990's, when learning computer programming you had to start by  writing down the program on paper... ** \n\nIn 1973, i did study computer sciences, it was the second year of the department, here in Leuven. At the time computers were mainframes and you did fed them with programms by punch cards. Programing was writing down the program, than you punched it and the next day you get results, mostly error. That's the way it worked at that time. To teach us programing, they used the langage of that time, Fortran and some kind of invented assembly langage, it didn't really exist, it was simplified.\n\nMost of the time you did write down your program, the teacher and the assistant would have to tell you what is wrong or good, you didn't had much practical experience.\n\n**How was it like, tons of pages ?** \n\nNo. As an anecdocte, i remember punchcards were a block of papers, we were jealous of the people who came in the computer center with huge stacks of cards. That were really small programs, not complicated one. The fact you had to learn to use the computer from scratch, everything was new, you couldn't rely on previous experiences, everything was new. And to start with small programs was difficult enough. \n\nThat was also the time when Edsger W. Dijkstra who forked the goto... i still remember him, in an audience, giving us a lecture on modernisation in programming at the International computing symposium 1977 in Liège (programming: from craft to scientific discipline https://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/EWD/transcriptions/EWD05xx/EWD566.html). He told usxx (i'll complete it as soon as possible. i need Jean's input)\"\n\nAnd then from 75 on, computers became cheaper and could be bought by departments and smaller entities. And than came the first interactive computer. Still beasts about two cubic meters, costing two millions belgian francs. But it was low enough to allow people to type in directly commands. I started working here in 75 as a researcher, it have evolved continuously and i saw computer getting cheaper and getting easier to use.The way to use it was simplified, you could start to go to the beast and try it out.\n\nI remember more or less: you did write down the program in Fortran for instance… We always thought in the beginning that it would work and it didn't, so after a turn around you were giving it back to the operator and you have to wait half a day or a night to get the results.\n\n**What kind of program you were working on?** \n\nI remember the first program i had to write was you got three numbers, you had to make the program decide if you construct a triangle with the numbers being the sides of the triangle.\n\n**That took an afternoon to be processed ?** \n\nWell, yeah. You had to imagine how to do it which was also one problem, than you prepare the card with the punching machine and you give the package of cards to the operator who was feeeding the computer with the cards. People had the taks to fed the computers by hands, with paper, cards, than disks and it lasts onto the magnetic disks period. And after a number of hours or a night you get a listing, a piece of paper, with the results.\n\n**When where you able to record the program onto the machine?**\n\nI think that happens between 75 and 80. After the punching cards which was already a way to record the program, we had  typewriters, terminals but we could record the programs, we could store them on the computer. We had magnetic discs. IBM had number for everything, i remember the 33-30 [manufactured from 1970 on] had a magnetic disk. We didn't touch the machines, operators would change the disks, we could only access the typewriter. That was our most direct connexion to the computer. Thetimes were diffent. The mainframes were such huge costly beasts that it had operators day and night keeping it busy. Even at night there were two or three guys mounting tapes, dismounting tapes, that kind of stuff.\nhttps://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/42/IBM_magnetic_disk_drives_3330%2B3333.png/600px-IBM_magnetic_disk_drives_3330%2B3333.png\n\n**When did you stop working with operators?** \n\nSomewhere between 85 and 90. There were still operators at the main computer of the university, but there were also small computers, so researchers and student can have direct access when needed. \n\n**When did you start to work with software sold by others or gived away in order to do your research?** \n\nYou stil need an operating system on the mainframe that was delivered by IBM or the constructor delivering the mainframe. When you bought mini-computers, which were the  smaller versions of mainframes, in most cases you did buy an operating systems, compilers and all the stuff you need to be able to program those things. In most cases, because the computer sciences department did buy the mini-computer from, for instance *digital equipment corporation*,  a manufactorer of that time, but they didn't buy their software. They were not open source or free,  but you could get Unix and could run it on those digital equipment (DEC) computers. That is what the computer department of the University of Louvain la Neuve *l'unité d'informatique*, did and so did we.\n\n**When did you start working with unix as an os?** \n\nI took a trip to Amsterdam, it must have been in 1979/80… Well, the story starts in our french sister university (LLN) where they did have a PDP-11 with Unix on it https://hackadaycom.files.wordpress.com/2016/08/full-size-pdp11.jpg. You got Unix, at the time, when you were a university, from Bell Aps (Ma Bell), the american telephone company. It was a mega organisation at the time [before the [dismantlment of AT&T/Bell system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breakup_of_the_Bell_System)].Due to monopoly, the US authorities splitted up in different Baby Bells. One of the restriction was there was a research baby bell, they couldn't really sell anything.There were computer scientists there, who did developped some Unix interesting things.  For universities you did get the source and no support for free. How to install it, no idea. In Unité d'informatique, they were lucky: they got the same computer that unix were developped on.  They got the disk by snail mail as a post-office package. They mounted it and it did spin up and they had it.\nHere, we did have a cheaper PDP11 (DEC - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PDP-11) We go the disk source from Bell Aps but we could not run it. We could look at it but that was all, because our disc format was different than the one at Bell Aps. Somebody here did write a driver for that disk and we did compiled it in l'unité d'informatique of LLN.  it did compile it but we couldn't try it because we did not have So we find the nearest Unix system compatiblewith ours, it was in Amsterdam.  Andrew Tenebaum who did write since then a number of books about operating systems and became quite an authority. He was working there. It was the young Tanenbaum, just arriving from United States to Amsterdam. He was learning to speak dutch. We did understood his english better but his assistant insisted that he speaks dutch because he will have to pass an exam in dutch. There we got a disk, than also the one with the driver we compiled, than we got here and we start using Unix.  Than in my opinion the start of open source was Unix because we had to maintain it by ourselves and we learned a lot from the sources.\nIn that time we did had to get software and it brings us to different places. For example, at the time the agents at the custom at the airport or post didn't know what to do with the discs in terms of custom clearance. They used magnetic or xrays, we had to write on the package that it should not be x-rayed. But we got time to time unreadable discs. \n\n**So it took like weeks between the transportation, the custom...**\nYes, the custom had to clear the packages. I remember i've been in the customs in Zaventem. I had received a letter that my package from Bell Aps had arrived. I went there thinking i would have to pay something and go. But no. It had to be cleared so there wa some organisation that had to do administrative stuff, so i only got it a few days later. The response time was huge :)\n\n**Than after that period of time how did you switch from that kind of collaboration on how to make software and make software work to collaboration on networks, between universities and researchers...**\nIn the Unix system of that time there was a kind of networking protocol which only did work on serial lines.\n You could connect two unix systems together you only need a line. We had one between LLN and Leuven, it's only 15 kms, but we had to ask Belgacom, than La Régie des télégraphes et téléphones, to get a modem to connect through their network and than over that modem you could reach an amazing speed of 300 characters per second. And that was the first communication. It did happened somewhere around 85. And then you had connexion with another computer, writing something here and do  something. And we could send programs to each other. \n \n **What was the first thing you did send through a network like this?**\n I didn't do it myself, i remember it was a kind of chat program. And on LLN side was Elie Milgrom, he is retired now. On this side, it was Pr Willems. And i remember that they typed something and they got a response from the other side and that was it.  But i remember that Pr Willems sent \"ok we stop now\". And that Elie Milgrom answered \"See you later, Alligator\" [a reference to Bill Haley and the Comets].  At the time we still had these kind of songs in mind. (lol). Those Unix to Unix connexions were first. And there was a worldwide Unix to Unix based network, Usenet (1979), it still exists somewhere... you can download load  of illegal movies and that stuff, that was not what we meant at the time. But that is what is left. And Usenet became gradually replaced by the Internet in USA. In Europe, the Internet came a lot later, but we had access to the Internet, we could send mail to them and we could receive mail from them, because some friendly american university, later companies, did translate internet mail to UCP mail. That was before the 1990's.\n \n **Your relation to software had changed at the time because you did not have to do all this manipulations with the software your received... Was it already floppy discs ?**\n No, magnetic tapes, for the mainframe at least. Most of the mini-computers had some cheaper magnetic tapes. Between 90 and 95 the main machines for the software institute was a VAX from DEC. Once a year the software came from Berkeley, it was still Unix but modified by Berkeley for virtual memory and all the stuff which are common now. We received a tape, with lot of goodies, i still remember we didn't know what was on there but we scrutinised there to know what was there, what we can use.\nIn Europe, companies like Siemens were trying to set up software centers to make software avaiable, they were even trying to set up networks. Researchers did love the Internet, it worked, it was useful for their researchs. So companies in Europe, were trying to set up their own networks, i remember for example the X/OPEN transport protocol. Their was a lot of standards about what software layers should do, but it didn't succeed because sometime, 92 maybe, IBM decided to quit their own private network and to go forTCP/IP and was the switching point. Everything done for X/OPEN were suddently forgotten. For the mainframes, and certainly in Belgium computing was mainly mainframes, i'm talking about universities here, so when IBM decided to go for TCP/IP we followed even though things were really slow. For example, Belgacom was not interested in running the Domain Name System so we did it here, for some time, starting in 1993 with Pierre Verbaten (https://www.dnsbelgium.be/en/history). Belgacom were focused on X25 (DCS - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X.25) so they missed it.\n\nIt was like the french Minitel ? \nWell, at that time we were really jealous about Minitel. Could you imagine that? Terminals?  At home ? You could work home with a computer ! You could send emails ! All in one, a pc computer with a modem ! \n\nHow did the research about software evolved in the department?\nI am mainly talking about network research but here there were people working on numerical analysis, computing, artificial intelligence ... I was just not involved in those research so i don't know much about it \n\nYou were focused on software and network..\nYes, we did produce some software. We did make software to generate compilers, there was some A.I. software in Prolog, numerical analysis  libraries... Some were sold or shared, it depends.  \nWe did sell some software since the beginning i think when it was not even a department but a professor and a couple of students.\n\nIs it when you joined ? \nNo it was already a department. I did study dutch industrial engeneering in electronics. At the time in electronics you did hear something about computers, i was interested in it i wanted to know more. I heard they had started a year before a degree in computer engeneering. It was the first year where industrial engineer could join. The only thing we knew about computer were in movies. I wanted to know how it work. I'm not sure i still know now even if maybe i have some ideas...\n\nHow many langage do you know ?\nAssembly, FORTRAN, PL-1 the langage invented by IBM to be the universal one, C, Cobol. Perl, i don't know, so more. I'm not fluent in any other langages, but i can read any langage especially well writtened, i know i can understand it and learn it...I know JAVA also. As a system administrator the thing i use most are the command line of UNIX and Perl. But that's because i'm more familiar with those two so it goes faster.\n\nHow did you see the rise of personnal computer and the software that goes with ? \nI have to admit that we missed it. We didn't see that what was new was powerful. We were not impressed by the software. I remember windows 95, the news on TV, people sleeping on the street to get it. I remember when i get my first windows version, with a box of 22 floppies or so. Then i wanted to do something, to compile a program, but there was no compiler. We were used to Unix, a basic system but with a lot of utilities in it. Software was for us free, and we were used to have it free and it was not free anymore. \n\nDoes that mean you didn't had a personnal computer until late ? \nYes. I think it was round 2000. I didn't needed it really. I got one when the belgian UCP network became commercial. Of course i did not get Windows on it.  I think we got Linux here in 1994. There was a guy involved in the kernel studying here. So we did used it very fast.\n\nSo, what is software for you ?\nFor me software is the magic that make computer usable. I can only gives examples of what i mean by it. A PC without software most people, even computer scientists, can't do anything with it. You need basic software. Some software are already integrated in the computer hardware. Same for phones, tablets... The main characteristic, for me, is that it should be user friendly. That is very difficult i know, because you have to imagine what the people using your software are going to do with it and how they want to use it, that's the magic you need to solve.\n\nIs command line user friendly ? \nWell, somehow you have to learn the command langage that is in fact a computer langage where you can make all the constructs that other langages offers.\nYou can create loops, you can test, whatever. It's not so different from computer langages like C or JAVA or whatever. \n\nBut it's already software no ? User friendly depends on what you put behind these words, no ? \nYes it's already software. But i don't have a strong opinion about command lines. It depends on people. I can imagine that someone that have never heaSometimes i find

the joy of assisting during the TGSO.**\n**I heard that that until recently, let's say the late 1990's, when learning computer programming you had to start by  writing down the program on paper... ** \n\nIn 1973, i did study computer sciences, it was the second year of the department, here in Leuven. At the time computers were mainframes and you did fed them with programms by punch cards. Programing was writing down the program, than you punched it and the next day you get results, mostly error. That's the way it worked at that time. To teach us programing, they used the langage of that time, Fortran and some kind of invented assembly langage, it didn't really exist, it was simplified.\n\nMost of the time you did write down your program, the teacher and the assistant would have to tell you what is wrong or good, you didn't had much practical experience.\n\n**How was it like, tons of pages ?** \n\nNo. As an anecdocte, i remember punchcards were a block of papers, we were jealous of the people who came in the computer center with huge stacks of cards. That were really small programs, not complicated one. The fact you had to learn to use the computer from scratch, everything was new, you couldn't rely on previous experiences, everything was new. And to start with small programs was difficult enough. \n\nThat was also the time when Edsger W. Dijkstra who forked the goto... i still remember him, in an audience, giving us a lecture on modernisation in programming at the International computing symposium 1977 in Liège (programming: from craft to scientific discipline https://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/EWD/transcriptions/EWD05xx/EWD566.html). He told usxx (i'll complete it as soon as possible. i need Jean's input)\"\n\nAnd then from 75 on, computers became cheaper and could be bought by departments and smaller entities. And than came the first interactive computer. Still beasts about two cubic meters, costing two millions belgian francs. But it was low enough to allow people to type in directly commands. I started working here in 75 as a researcher, it have evolved continuously and i saw computer getting cheaper and getting easier to use.The way to use it was simplified, you could start to go to the beast and try it out.\n\nI remember more or less: you did write down the program in Fortran for instance… We always thought in the beginning that it would work and it didn't, so after a turn around you were giving it back to the operator and you have to wait half a day or a night to get the results.\n\n**What kind of program you were working on?** \n\nI remember the first program i had to write was you got three numbers, you had to make the program decide if you construct a triangle with the numbers being the sides of the triangle.\n\n**That took an afternoon to be processed ?** \n\nWell, yeah. You had to imagine how to do it which was also one problem, than you prepare the card with the punching machine and you give the package of cards to the operator who was feeeding the computer with the cards. People had the taks to fed the computers by hands, with paper, cards, than disks and it lasts onto the magnetic disks period. And after a number of hours or a night you get a listing, a piece of paper, with the results.\n\n**When where you able to record the program onto the machine?**\n\nI think that happens between 75 and 80. After the punching cards which was already a way to record the program, we had  typewriters, terminals but we could record the programs, we could store them on the computer. We had magnetic discs. IBM had number for everything, i remember the 33-30 [manufactured from 1970 on] had a magnetic disk. We didn't touch the machines, operators would change the disks, we could only access the typewriter. That was our most direct connexion to the computer. Thetimes were diffent. The mainframes were such huge costly beasts that it had operators day and night keeping it busy. Even at night there were two or three guys mounting tapes, dismounting tapes, that kind of stuff.\nhttps://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/42/IBM_magnetic_disk_drives_3330%2B3333.png/600px-IBM_magnetic_disk_drives_3330%2B3333.png\n\n**When did you stop working with operators?** \n\nSomewhere between 85 and 90. There were still operators at the main computer of the university, but there were also small computers, so researchers and student can have direct access when needed. \n\n**When did you start to work with software sold by others or gived away in order to do your research?** \n\nYou stil need an operating system on the mainframe that was delivered by IBM or the constructor delivering the mainframe. When you bought mini-computers, which were the  smaller versions of mainframes, in most cases you did buy an operating systems, compilers and all the stuff you need to be able to program those things. In most cases, because the computer sciences department did buy the mini-computer from, for instance *digital equipment corporation*,  a manufactorer of that time, but they didn't buy their software. They were not open source or free,  but you could get Unix and could run it on those digital equipment (DEC) computers. That is what the computer department of the University of Louvain la Neuve *l'unité d'informatique*, did and so did we.\n\n**When did you start working with unix as an os?** \n\nI took a trip to Amsterdam, it must have been in 1979/80… Well, the story starts in our french sister university (LLN) where they did have a PDP-11 with Unix on it https://hackadaycom.files.wordpress.com/2016/08/full-size-pdp11.jpg. You got Unix, at the time, when you were a university, from Bell Aps (Ma Bell), the american telephone company. It was a mega organisation at the time [before the [dismantlment of AT&T/Bell system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breakup_of_the_Bell_System)].Due to monopoly, the US authorities splitted up in different Baby Bells. One of the restriction was there was a research baby bell, they couldn't really sell anything.There were computer scientists there, who did developped some Unix interesting things.  For universities you did get the source and no support for free. How to install it, no idea. In Unité d'informatique, they were lucky: they got the same computer that unix were developped on.  They got the disk by snail mail as a post-office package. They mounted it and it did spin up and they had it.\nHere, we did have a cheaper PDP11 (DEC - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PDP-11) We go the disk source from Bell Aps but we could not run it. We could look at it but that was all, because our disc format was different than the one at Bell Aps. Somebody here did write a driver for that disk and we did compiled it in l'unité d'informatique of LLN.  it did compile it but we couldn't try it because we did not have So we find the nearest Unix system compatiblewith ours, it was in Amsterdam.  Andrew Tenebaum who did write since then a number of books about operating systems and became quite an authority. He was working there. It was the young Tanenbaum, just arriving from United States to Amsterdam. He was learning to speak dutch. We did understood his english better but his assistant insisted that he speaks dutch because he will have to pass an exam in dutch. There we got a disk, than also the one with the driver we compiled, than we got here and we start using Unix.  Than in my opinion the start of open source was Unix because we had to maintain it by ourselves and we learned a lot from the sources.\nIn that time we did had to get software and it brings us to different places. For example, at the time the agents at the custom at the airport or post didn't know what to do with the discs in terms of custom clearance. They used magnetic or xrays, we had to write on the package that it should not be x-rayed. But we got time to time unreadable discs. \n\n**So it took like weeks between the transportation, the custom...**\nYes, the custom had to clear the packages. I remember i've been in the customs in Zaventem. I had received a letter that my package from Bell Aps had arrived. I went there thinking i would have to pay something and go. But no. It had to be cleared so there wa some organisation that had to do administrative stuff, so i only got it a few days later. The response time was huge :)\n\n**Than after that period of time how did you switch from that kind of collaboration on how to make software and make software work to collaboration on networks, between universities and researchers...**\nIn the Unix system of that time there was a kind of networking protocol which only did work on serial lines.\n You could connect two unix systems together you only need a line. We had one between LLN and Leuven, it's only 15 kms, but we had to ask Belgacom, than La Régie des télégraphes et téléphones, to get a modem to connect through their network and than over that modem you could reach an amazing speed of 300 characters per second. And that was the first communication. It did happened somewhere around 85. And then you had connexion with another computer, writing something here and do  something. And we could send programs to each other. \n \n **What was the first thing you did send through a network like this?**\n I didn't do it myself, i remember it was a kind of chat program. And on LLN side was Elie Milgrom, he is retired now. On this side, it was Pr Willems. And i remember that they typed something and they got a response from the other side and that was it.  But i remember that Pr Willems sent \"ok we stop now\". And that Elie Milgrom answered \"See you later, Alligator\" [a reference to Bill Haley and the Comets].  At the time we still had these kind of songs in mind. (lol). Those Unix to Unix connexions were first. And there was a worldwide Unix to Unix based network, Usenet (1979), it still exists somewhere... you can download load  of illegal movies and that stuff, that was not what we meant at the time. But that is what is left. And Usenet became gradually replaced by the Internet in USA. In Europe, the Internet came a lot later, but we had access to the Internet, we could send mail to them and we could receive mail from them, because some friendly american university, later companies, did translate internet mail to UCP mail. That was before the 1990's.\n \n **Your relation to software had changed at the time because you did not have to do all this manipulations with the software your received... Was it already floppy discs ?**\n No, magnetic tapes, for the mainframe at least. Most of the mini-computers had some cheaper magnetic tapes. Between 90 and 95 the main machines for the software institute was a VAX from DEC. Once a year the software came from Berkeley, it was still Unix but modified by Berkeley for virtual memory and all the stuff which are common now. We received a tape, with lot of goodies, i still remember we didn't know what was on there but we scrutinised there to know what was there, what we can use.\nIn Europe, companies like Siemens were trying to set up software centers to make software avaiable, they were even trying to set up networks. Researchers did love the Internet, it worked, it was useful for their researchs. So companies in Europe, were trying to set up their own networks, i remember for example the X/OPEN transport protocol. Their was a lot of standards about what software layers should do, but it didn't succeed because sometime, 92 maybe, IBM decided to quit their own private network and to go forTCP/IP and was the switching point. Everything done for X/OPEN were suddently forgotten. For the mainframes, and certainly in Belgium computing was mainly mainframes, i'm talking about universities here, so when IBM decided to go for TCP/IP we followed even though things were really slow. For example, Belgacom was not interested in running the Domain Name System so we did it here, for some time, starting in 1993 with Pierre Verbaten (https://www.dnsbelgium.be/en/history). Belgacom were focused on X25 (DCS - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X.25) so they missed it.\n\nIt was like the french Minitel ? \nWell, at that time we were really jealous about Minitel. Could you imagine that? Terminals?  At home ? You could work home with a computer ! You could send emails ! All in one, a pc computer with a modem ! \n\nHow did the research about software evolved in the department?\nI am mainly talking about network research but here there were people working on numerical analysis, computing, artificial intelligence ... I was just not involved in those research so i don't know much about it \n\nYou were focused on software and network..\nYes, we did produce some software. We did make software to generate compilers, there was some A.I. software in Prolog, numerical analysis  libraries... Some were sold or shared, it depends.  \nWe did sell some software since the beginning i think when it was not even a department but a professor and a couple of students.\n\nIs it when you joined ? \nNo it was already a department. I did study dutch industrial engeneering in electronics. At the time in electronics you did hear something about computers, i was interested in it i wanted to know more. I heard they had started a year before a degree in computer engeneering. It was the first year where industrial engineer could join. The only thing we knew about computer were in movies. I wanted to know how it work. I'm not sure i still know now even if maybe i have some ideas...\n\nHow many langage do you know ?\nAssembly, FORTRAN, PL-1 the langage invented by IBM to be the universal one, C, Cobol. Perl, i don't know, so more. I'm not fluent in any other langages, but i can read any langage especially well writtened, i know i can understand it and learn it...I know JAVA also. As a system administrator the thing i use most are the command line of UNIX and Perl. But that's because i'm more familiar with those two so it goes faster.\n\nHow did you see the rise of personnal computer and the software that goes with ? \nI have to admit that we missed it. We didn't see that what was new was powerful. We were not impressed by the software. I remember windows 95, the news on TV, people sleeping on the street to get it. I remember when i get my first windows version, with a box of 22 floppies or so. Then i wanted to do something, to compile a program, but there was no compiler. We were used to Unix, a basic system but with a lot of utilities in it. Software was for us free, and we were used to have it free and it was not free anymore. \n\nDoes that mean you didn't had a personnal computer until late ? \nYes. I think it was round 2000. I didn't needed it really. I got one when the belgian UCP network became commercial. Of course i did not get Windows on it.  I think we got Linux here in 1994. There was a guy involved in the kernel studying here. So we did used it very fast.\n\nSo, what is software for you ?\nFor me software is the magic that make computer usable. I can only gives examples of what i mean by it. A PC without software most people, even computer scientists, can't do anything with it. You need basic software. Some software are already integrated in the computer hardware. Same for phones, tablets... The main characteristic, for me, is that it should be user friendly. That is very difficult i know, because you have to imagine what the people using your software are going to do with it and how they want to use it, that's the magic you need to solve.\n\nIs command line user friendly ? \nWell, somehow you have to learn the command langage that is in fact a computer langage where you can make all the constructs that other langages offers.\nYou can create loops, you can test, whatever. It's not so different from computer langages like C or JAVA or whatever. \n\nBut it's already software no ? User friendly depends on what you put behind these words, no ? \nYes it's already software. I don't have a strong opinion about command lines. It depends on people. I can imagine that someone that have never heard about the command line expect that you click somewhere and it happens. But if you know the command langage it's sometimes easier or productive to type commands and let it run. Sometimes i find it easier if i have a s\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","attribs":"|1+g*6|2+2*5+3p*6|1+1*5+4f*6|2+2+dm*6|2+2+4n*6|1+1|1+1*5+11*6|2+2+bc*6|2+2+5z*2+3e*3+1*4*3+20*4+1*6|2+2+e7*6|2+2+7n*6|2+2*5+1a*6|2+2+53*6|2+2*5+19*6|2+2+c7*6|2+2*5+1r*6|2+2+jo*6|1+1+41*6|2+2*5+1a*6|2+2+5g*6|2+2*5+2w*6|2+2+l6*6|2+2*5+1f*6|2+2+8f*5+7+kh*6|1+1+uu*0|1+1+9s*0|2+2*5+1v*0|1+1+aj*0|2+2*5+5m*0|1+1+30*0|1+1+48*2+15+9l*0|1+1+1*0|1+1+1*5+1y*0|1+1+tm*0|1+1+1*0|1+1*5+4t*0|1+1+dr*0|1+1+u6*0|2+2*5+x*0|1+1+5q*0|2+2*5+1q*0|1+1+5w*0|2+2*5+16*0|1+1+5b*0|1+1+3l*0|2+2*5+o*0|1+1+df*0|2+2*5+u*0|1+1+bs*0|2+2*5+29*0|1+1+eh*0|2+2*5+1s*0|1+1+7m*0|2+2*5+u*0|1+1+7s*0+r+71*0|2+2*0*5+w*0|4+7n*0*5+2m*0|5+aa*6|5+5|1+1"}}},"pad:observatory.guide.jeanhuensitvextended:revs:6301":{"changeset":"Z:clb>2|2j=caw=a5*0+2$cr","meta":{"author":"a.kqv62Q3nhchdwIuK","timestamp":1518100922821}},"pad:observatory.guide.jeanhuensitvextended:revs:6302":{"changeset":"Z:cld>2|2j=caw=a7*0+2$ee","meta":{"author":"a.kqv62Q3nhchdwIuK","timestamp":1518100923320}},"pad:observatory.guide.jeanhuensitvextended:revs:6303":{"changeset":"Z:clf>4|2j=caw=a9*0+4$n

__NOPUBLISH__\n\n\n**You have been using computers since a long time, as you explained us during the tour we had the joy of assisting during the TGSO.**\n**I heard that that until recently, let's say the late 1990's, when learning computer programming you had to start by  writing down the program on paper... ** \n\nIn 1973, i did study computer sciences, it was the second year of the department, here in Leuven. At the time computers were mainframes and you did fed them with programms by punch cards. Programing was writing down the program, than you punched it and the next day you get results, mostly error. That's the way it worked at that time. To teach us programing, they used the langage of that time, Fortran and some kind of invented assembly langage, it didn't really exist, it was simplified.\n\nMost of the time you did write down your program, the teacher and the assistant would have to tell you what is wrong or good, you didn't had much practical experience.\n\n**How was it like, tons of pages ?** \n\nNo. As an anecdocte, i remember punchcards were a block of papers, we were jealous of the people who came in the computer center with huge stacks of cards. That were really small programs, not complicated one. The fact you had to learn to use the computer from scratch, everything was new, you couldn't rely on previous experiences, everything was new. And to start with small programs was difficult enough. \n\nThat was also the time when Edsger W. Dijkstra who forked the goto... i still remember him, in an audience, giving us a lecture on modernisation in programming at the International computing symposium 1977 in Liège (programming: from craft to scientific discipline https://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/EWD/transcriptions/EWD05xx/EWD566.html). He told usxx (i'll complete it as soon as possible. i need Jean's input)\"\n\nAnd then from 75 on, computers became cheaper and could be bought by departments and smaller entities. And than came the first interactive computer. Still beasts about two cubic meters, costing two millions belgian francs. But it was low enough to allow people to type in directly commands. I started working here in 75 as a researcher, it have evolved continuously and i saw computer getting cheaper and getting easier to use.The way to use it was simplified, you could start to go to the beast and try it out.\n\nI remember more or less: you did write down the program in Fortran for instance… We always thought in the beginning that it would work and it didn't, so after a turn around you were giving it back to the operator and you have to wait half a day or a night to get the results.\n\n**What kind of program you were working on?** \n\nI remember the first program i had to write was you got three numbers, you had to make the program decide if you construct a triangle with the numbers being the sides of the triangle.\n\n**That took an afternoon to be processed ?** \n\nWell, yeah. You had to imagine how to do it which was also one problem, than you prepare the card with the punching machine and you give the package of cards to the operator who was feeeding the computer with the cards. People had the taks to fed the computers by hands, with paper, cards, than disks and it lasts onto the magnetic disks period. And after a number of hours or a night you get a listing, a piece of paper, with the results.\n\n**When where you able to record the program onto the machine?**\n\nI think that happens between 75 and 80. After the punching cards which was already a way to record the program, we had  typewriters, terminals but we could record the programs, we could store them on the computer. We had magnetic discs. IBM had number for everything, i remember the 33-30 [manufactured from 1970 on] had a magnetic disk. We didn't touch the machines, operators would change the disks, we could only access the typewriter. That was our most direct connexion to the computer. Thetimes were diffent. The mainframes were such huge costly beasts that it had operators day and night keeping it busy. Even at night there were two or three guys mounting tapes, dismounting tapes, that kind of stuff.\nhttps://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/42/IBM_magnetic_disk_drives_3330%2B3333.png/600px-IBM_magnetic_disk_drives_3330%2B3333.png\n\n**When did you stop working with operators?** \n\nSomewhere between 85 and 90. There were still operators at the main computer of the university, but there were also small computers, so researchers and student can have direct access when needed. \n\n**When did you start to work with software sold by others or gived away in order to do your research?** \n\nYou stil need an operating system on the mainframe that was delivered by IBM or the constructor delivering the mainframe. When you bought mini-computers, which were the  smaller versions of mainframes, in most cases you did buy an operating systems, compilers and all the stuff you need to be able to program those things. In most cases, because the computer sciences department did buy the mini-computer from, for instance *digital equipment corporation*,  a manufactorer of that time, but they didn't buy their software. They were not open source or free,  but you could get Unix and could run it on those digital equipment (DEC) computers. That is what the computer department of the University of Louvain la Neuve *l'unité d'informatique*, did and so did we.\n\n**When did you start working with unix as an os?** \n\nI took a trip to Amsterdam, it must have been in 1979/80… Well, the story starts in our french sister university (LLN) where they did have a PDP-11 with Unix on it https://hackadaycom.files.wordpress.com/2016/08/full-size-pdp11.jpg. You got Unix, at the time, when you were a university, from Bell Aps (Ma Bell), the american telephone company. It was a mega organisation at the time [before the [dismantlment of AT&T/Bell system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breakup_of_the_Bell_System)].Due to monopoly, the US authorities splitted up in different Baby Bells. One of the restriction was there was a research baby bell, they couldn't really sell anything.There were computer scientists there, who did developped some Unix interesting things.  For universities you did get the source and no support for free. How to install it, no idea. In Unité d'informatique, they were lucky: they got the same computer that unix were developped on.  They got the disk by snail mail as a post-office package. They mounted it and it did spin up and they had it.\nHere, we did have a cheaper PDP11 (DEC - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PDP-11) We go the disk source from Bell Aps but we could not run it. We could look at it but that was all, because our disc format was different than the one at Bell Aps. Somebody here did write a driver for that disk and we did compiled it in l'unité d'informatique of LLN.  it did compile it but we couldn't try it because we did not have So we find the nearest Unix system compatiblewith ours, it was in Amsterdam.  Andrew Tenebaum who did write since then a number of books about operating systems and became quite an authority. He was working there. It was the young Tanenbaum, just arriving from United States to Amsterdam. He was learning to speak dutch. We did understood his english better but his assistant insisted that he speaks dutch because he will have to pass an exam in dutch. There we got a disk, than also the one with the driver we compiled, than we got here and we start using Unix.  Than in my opinion the start of open source was Unix because we had to maintain it by ourselves and we learned a lot from the sources.\nIn that time we did had to get software and it brings us to different places. For example, at the time the agents at the custom at the airport or post didn't know what to do with the discs in terms of custom clearance. They used magnetic or xrays, we had to write on the package that it should not be x-rayed. But we got time to time unreadable discs. \n\n**So it took like weeks between the transportation, the custom...**\nYes, the custom had to clear the packages. I remember i've been in the customs in Zaventem. I had received a letter that my package from Bell Aps had arrived. I went there thinking i would have to pay something and go. But no. It had to be cleared so there wa some organisation that had to do administrative stuff, so i only got it a few days later. The response time was huge :)\n\n**Than after that period of time how did you switch from that kind of collaboration on how to make software and make software work to collaboration on networks, between universities and researchers...**\nIn the Unix system of that time there was a kind of networking protocol which only did work on serial lines.\n You could connect two unix systems together you only need a line. We had one between LLN and Leuven, it's only 15 kms, but we had to ask Belgacom, than La Régie des télégraphes et téléphones, to get a modem to connect through their network and than over that modem you could reach an amazing speed of 300 characters per second. And that was the first communication. It did happened somewhere around 85. And then you had connexion with another computer, writing something here and do  something. And we could send programs to each other. \n \n **What was the first thing you did send through a network like this?**\n I didn't do it myself, i remember it was a kind of chat program. And on LLN side was Elie Milgrom, he is retired now. On this side, it was Pr Willems. And i remember that they typed something and they got a response from the other side and that was it.  But i remember that Pr Willems sent \"ok we stop now\". And that Elie Milgrom answered \"See you later, Alligator\" [a reference to Bill Haley and the Comets].  At the time we still had these kind of songs in mind. (lol). Those Unix to Unix connexions were first. And there was a worldwide Unix to Unix based network, Usenet (1979), it still exists somewhere... you can download load  of illegal movies and that stuff, that was not what we meant at the time. But that is what is left. And Usenet became gradually replaced by the Internet in USA. In Europe, the Internet came a lot later, but we had access to the Internet, we could send mail to them and we could receive mail from them, because some friendly american university, later companies, did translate internet mail to UCP mail. That was before the 1990's.\n \n **Your relation to software had changed at the time because you did not have to do all this manipulations with the software your received... Was it already floppy discs ?**\n No, magnetic tapes, for the mainframe at least. Most of the mini-computers had some cheaper magnetic tapes. Between 90 and 95 the main machines for the software institute was a VAX from DEC. Once a year the software came from Berkeley, it was still Unix but modified by Berkeley for virtual memory and all the stuff which are common now. We received a tape, with lot of goodies, i still remember we didn't know what was on there but we scrutinised there to know what was there, what we can use.\nIn Europe, companies like Siemens were trying to set up software centers to make software avaiable, they were even trying to set up networks. Researchers did love the Internet, it worked, it was useful for their researchs. So companies in Europe, were trying to set up their own networks, i remember for example the X/OPEN transport protocol. Their was a lot of standards about what software layers should do, but it didn't succeed because sometime, 92 maybe, IBM decided to quit their own private network and to go forTCP/IP and was the switching point. Everything done for X/OPEN were suddently forgotten. For the mainframes, and certainly in Belgium computing was mainly mainframes, i'm talking about universities here, so when IBM decided to go for TCP/IP we followed even though things were really slow. For example, Belgacom was not interested in running the Domain Name System so we did it here, for some time, starting in 1993 with Pierre Verbaten (https://www.dnsbelgium.be/en/history). Belgacom were focused on X25 (DCS - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X.25) so they missed it.\n\nIt was like the french Minitel ? \nWell, at that time we were really jealous about Minitel. Could you imagine that? Terminals?  At home ? You could work home with a computer ! You could send emails ! All in one, a pc computer with a modem ! \n\nHow did the research about software evolved in the department?\nI am mainly talking about network research but here there were people working on numerical analysis, computing, artificial intelligence ... I was just not involved in those research so i don't know much about it \n\nYou were focused on software and network..\nYes, we did produce some software. We did make software to generate compilers, there was some A.I. software in Prolog, numerical analysis  libraries... Some were sold or shared, it depends.  \nWe did sell some software since the beginning i think when it was not even a department but a professor and a couple of students.\n\nIs it when you joined ? \nNo it was already a department. I did study dutch industrial engeneering in electronics. At the time in electronics you did hear something about computers, i was interested in it i wanted to know more. I heard they had started a year before a degree in computer engeneering. It was the first year where industrial engineer could join. The only thing we knew about computer were in movies. I wanted to know how it work. I'm not sure i still know now even if maybe i have some ideas...\n\nHow many langage do you know ?\nAssembly, FORTRAN, PL-1 the langage invented by IBM to be the universal one, C, Cobol. Perl, i don't know, so more. I'm not fluent in any other langages, but i can read any langage especially well writtened, i know i can understand it and learn it...I know JAVA also. As a system administrator the thing i use most are the command line of UNIX and Perl. But that's because i'm more familiar with those two so it goes faster.\n\nHow did you see the rise of personnal computer and the software that goes with ? \nI have to admit that we missed it. We didn't see that what was new was powerful. We were not impressed by the software. I remember windows 95, the news on TV, people sleeping on the street to get it. I remember when i get my first windows version, with a box of 22 floppies or so. Then i wanted to do something, to compile a program, but there was no compiler. We were used to Unix, a basic system but with a lot of utilities in it. Software was for us free, and we were used to have it free and it was not free anymore. \n\nDoes that mean you didn't had a personnal computer until late ? \nYes. I think it was round 2000. I didn't needed it really. I got one when the belgian UCP network became commercial. Of course i did not get Windows on it.  I think we got Linux here in 1994. There was a guy involved in the kernel studying here. So we did used it very fast.\n\nSo, what is software for you ?\nFor me software is the magic that make computer usable. I can only gives examples of what i mean by it. A PC without software most people, even computer scientists, can't do anything with it. You need basic software. Some software are already integrated in the computer hardware. Same for phones, tablets... The main characteristic, for me, is that it should be user friendly. That is very difficult i know, because you have to imagine what the people using your software are going to do with it and how they want to use it, that's the magic you need to solve.\n\nIs command line user friendly ? \nWell, somehow you have to learn the command langage that is in fact a computer langage where you can make all the constructs that other langages offers.\nYou can create loops, you can test, whatever. It's not so different from computer langages like C or JAVA or whatever. \n\nBut it's already software no ? User friendly depends on what you put behind these words, no ? \nYes it's already software. I don't have a strong opinion about command lines. It depends on people. I can imagine that someone that have never heard about the command line expect that you click somewhere and it happens. But if you know the command langage it's sometimes easier or productive to type commands and let it run. Sometimes i find it easier if i have a screen and a number of buttons and i don't have to imagine what is happening behind the screen. And sometimes i want to do something with the command because i'm used to it. That's why i don't trust myself about user friendl\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","attribs":"|1+g*6|2+2*5+3p*6|1+1*5+4f*6|2+2+dm*6|2+2+4n*6|1+1|1+1*5+11*6|2+2+bc*6|2+2+5z*2+3e*3+1*4*3+20*4+1*6|2+2+e7*6|2+2+7n*6|2+2*5+1a*6|2+2+53*6|2+2*5+19*6|2+2+c7*6|2+2*5+1r*6|2+2+jo*6|1+1+41*6|2+2*5+1a*6|2+2+5g*6|2+2*5+2w*6|2+2+l6*6|2+2*5+1f*6|2+2+8f*5+7+kh*6|1+1+uu*0|1+1+9s*0|2+2*5+1v*0|1+1+aj*0|2+2*5+5m*0|1+1+30*0|1+1+48*2+15+9l*0|1+1+1*0|1+1+1*5+1y*0|1+1+tm*0|1+1+1*0|1+1*5+4t*0|1+1+dr*0|1+1+u6*0|2+2*5+x*0|1+1+5q*0|2+2*5+1q*0|1+1+5w*0|2+2*5+16*0|1+1+5b*0|1+1+3l*0|2+2*5+o*0|1+1+df*0|2+2*5+u*0|1+1+bs*0|2+2*5+29*0|1+1+eh*0|2+2*5+1s*0|1+1+7m*0|2+2*5+u*0|1+1+7s*0+r+71*0|2+2*0*5+w*0|4+7n*0*5+2m*0|5+gh*6|5+5|1+1"}}},"pad:observatory.guide.jeanhuensitvextended:revs:6401":{"changeset":"Z:cri>1|2j=caw=gc*0+1$y","meta":{"author":"a.kqv62Q3nhchdwIuK","timestamp":1518101000190}},"pad:observatory.guide.jeanhuensitvextended:revs:6402":{"changeset":"Z:crj>0|2j=caw=gc-1*0+1$i","meta":{"author":"a.kqv62Q3nhchdwIuK","timestamp":1518101000709}},"pad:observatory.guide.jeanhuensitvextended:revs:6403":{"changeset":"Z:crj>2|2j=caw=gd*0+2$ne","meta":{"author":"a.kqv62Q3nhchdwIuK","timestamp":1518101001208}},"pad:observatory.guide.jeanhuensitvextended:revs:6404":{"changeset":"Z:crl>3|2j=caw=gf*0+3$ss

__NOPUBLISH__\n\n\n**You have been using computers since a long time, as you explained us during the tour we had the joy of assisting during the TGSO.**\n**I heard that that until recently, let's say the late 1990's, when learning computer programming you had to start by  writing down the program on paper... ** \n\nIn 1973, i did study computer sciences, it was the second year of the department, here in Leuven. At the time computers were mainframes and you did fed them with programms by punch cards. Programing was writing down the program, than you punched it and the next day you get results, mostly error. That's the way it worked at that time. To teach us programing, they used the langage of that time, Fortran and some kind of invented assembly langage, it didn't really exist, it was simplified.\n\nMost of the time you did write down your program, the teacher and the assistant would have to tell you what is wrong or good, you didn't had much practical experience.\n\n**How was it like, tons of pages ?** \n\nNo. As an anecdocte, i remember punchcards were a block of papers, we were jealous of the people who came in the computer center with huge stacks of cards. That were really small programs, not complicated one. The fact you had to learn to use the computer from scratch, everything was new, you couldn't rely on previous experiences, everything was new. And to start with small programs was difficult enough. \n\nThat was also the time when Edsger W. Dijkstra who forked the goto... i still remember him, in an audience, giving us a lecture on modernisation in programming at the International computing symposium 1977 in Liège (programming: from craft to scientific discipline https://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/EWD/transcriptions/EWD05xx/EWD566.html). He told usxx (i'll complete it as soon as possible. i need Jean's input)\"\n\nAnd then from 75 on, computers became cheaper and could be bought by departments and smaller entities. And than came the first interactive computer. Still beasts about two cubic meters, costing two millions belgian francs. But it was low enough to allow people to type in directly commands. I started working here in 75 as a researcher, it have evolved continuously and i saw computer getting cheaper and getting easier to use.The way to use it was simplified, you could start to go to the beast and try it out.\n\nI remember more or less: you did write down the program in Fortran for instance… We always thought in the beginning that it would work and it didn't, so after a turn around you were giving it back to the operator and you have to wait half a day or a night to get the results.\n\n**What kind of program you were working on?** \n\nI remember the first program i had to write was you got three numbers, you had to make the program decide if you construct a triangle with the numbers being the sides of the triangle.\n\n**That took an afternoon to be processed ?** \n\nWell, yeah. You had to imagine how to do it which was also one problem, than you prepare the card with the punching machine and you give the package of cards to the operator who was feeeding the computer with the cards. People had the taks to fed the computers by hands, with paper, cards, than disks and it lasts onto the magnetic disks period. And after a number of hours or a night you get a listing, a piece of paper, with the results.\n\n**When where you able to record the program onto the machine?**\n\nI think that happens between 75 and 80. After the punching cards which was already a way to record the program, we had  typewriters, terminals but we could record the programs, we could store them on the computer. We had magnetic discs. IBM had number for everything, i remember the 33-30 [manufactured from 1970 on] had a magnetic disk. We didn't touch the machines, operators would change the disks, we could only access the typewriter. That was our most direct connexion to the computer. Thetimes were diffent. The mainframes were such huge costly beasts that it had operators day and night keeping it busy. Even at night there were two or three guys mounting tapes, dismounting tapes, that kind of stuff.\nhttps://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/42/IBM_magnetic_disk_drives_3330%2B3333.png/600px-IBM_magnetic_disk_drives_3330%2B3333.png\n\n**When did you stop working with operators?** \n\nSomewhere between 85 and 90. There were still operators at the main computer of the university, but there were also small computers, so researchers and student can have direct access when needed. \n\n**When did you start to work with software sold by others or gived away in order to do your research?** \n\nYou stil need an operating system on the mainframe that was delivered by IBM or the constructor delivering the mainframe. When you bought mini-computers, which were the  smaller versions of mainframes, in most cases you did buy an operating systems, compilers and all the stuff you need to be able to program those things. In most cases, because the computer sciences department did buy the mini-computer from, for instance *digital equipment corporation*,  a manufactorer of that time, but they didn't buy their software. They were not open source or free,  but you could get Unix and could run it on those digital equipment (DEC) computers. That is what the computer department of the University of Louvain la Neuve *l'unité d'informatique*, did and so did we.\n\n**When did you start working with unix as an os?** \n\nI took a trip to Amsterdam, it must have been in 1979/80… Well, the story starts in our french sister university (LLN) where they did have a PDP-11 with Unix on it https://hackadaycom.files.wordpress.com/2016/08/full-size-pdp11.jpg. You got Unix, at the time, when you were a university, from Bell Aps (Ma Bell), the american telephone company. It was a mega organisation at the time [before the [dismantlment of AT&T/Bell system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breakup_of_the_Bell_System)].Due to monopoly, the US authorities splitted up in different Baby Bells. One of the restriction was there was a research baby bell, they couldn't really sell anything.There were computer scientists there, who did developped some Unix interesting things.  For universities you did get the source and no support for free. How to install it, no idea. In Unité d'informatique, they were lucky: they got the same computer that unix were developped on.  They got the disk by snail mail as a post-office package. They mounted it and it did spin up and they had it.\nHere, we did have a cheaper PDP11 (DEC - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PDP-11) We go the disk source from Bell Aps but we could not run it. We could look at it but that was all, because our disc format was different than the one at Bell Aps. Somebody here did write a driver for that disk and we did compiled it in l'unité d'informatique of LLN.  it did compile it but we couldn't try it because we did not have So we find the nearest Unix system compatiblewith ours, it was in Amsterdam.  Andrew Tenebaum who did write since then a number of books about operating systems and became quite an authority. He was working there. It was the young Tanenbaum, just arriving from United States to Amsterdam. He was learning to speak dutch. We did understood his english better but his assistant insisted that he speaks dutch because he will have to pass an exam in dutch. There we got a disk, than also the one with the driver we compiled, than we got here and we start using Unix.  Than in my opinion the start of open source was Unix because we had to maintain it by ourselves and we learned a lot from the sources.\nIn that time we did had to get software and it brings us to different places. For example, at the time the agents at the custom at the airport or post didn't know what to do with the discs in terms of custom clearance. They used magnetic or xrays, we had to write on the package that it should not be x-rayed. But we got time to time unreadable discs. \n\n**So it took like weeks between the transportation, the custom...**\nYes, the custom had to clear the packages. I remember i've been in the customs in Zaventem. I had received a letter that my package from Bell Aps had arrived. I went there thinking i would have to pay something and go. But no. It had to be cleared so there wa some organisation that had to do administrative stuff, so i only got it a few days later. The response time was huge :)\n\n**Than after that period of time how did you switch from that kind of collaboration on how to make software and make software work to collaboration on networks, between universities and researchers...**\nIn the Unix system of that time there was a kind of networking protocol which only did work on serial lines.\n You could connect two unix systems together you only need a line. We had one between LLN and Leuven, it's only 15 kms, but we had to ask Belgacom, than La Régie des télégraphes et téléphones, to get a modem to connect through their network and than over that modem you could reach an amazing speed of 300 characters per second. And that was the first communication. It did happened somewhere around 85. And then you had connexion with another computer, writing something here and do  something. And we could send programs to each other. \n \n **What was the first thing you did send through a network like this?**\n I didn't do it myself, i remember it was a kind of chat program. And on LLN side was Elie Milgrom, he is retired now. On this side, it was Pr Willems. And i remember that they typed something and they got a response from the other side and that was it.  But i remember that Pr Willems sent \"ok we stop now\". And that Elie Milgrom answered \"See you later, Alligator\" [a reference to Bill Haley and the Comets].  At the time we still had these kind of songs in mind. (lol). Those Unix to Unix connexions were first. And there was a worldwide Unix to Unix based network, Usenet (1979), it still exists somewhere... you can download load  of illegal movies and that stuff, that was not what we meant at the time. But that is what is left. And Usenet became gradually replaced by the Internet in USA. In Europe, the Internet came a lot later, but we had access to the Internet, we could send mail to them and we could receive mail from them, because some friendly american university, later companies, did translate internet mail to UCP mail. That was before the 1990's.\n \n **Your relation to software had changed at the time because you did not have to do all this manipulations with the software your received... Was it already floppy discs ?**\n No, magnetic tapes, for the mainframe at least. Most of the mini-computers had some cheaper magnetic tapes. Between 90 and 95 the main machines for the software institute was a VAX from DEC. Once a year the software came from Berkeley, it was still Unix but modified by Berkeley for virtual memory and all the stuff which are common now. We received a tape, with lot of goodies, i still remember we didn't know what was on there but we scrutinised there to know what was there, what we can use.\nIn Europe, companies like Siemens were trying to set up software centers to make software avaiable, they were even trying to set up networks. Researchers did love the Internet, it worked, it was useful for their researchs. So companies in Europe, were trying to set up their own networks, i remember for example the X/OPEN transport protocol. Their was a lot of standards about what software layers should do, but it didn't succeed because sometime, 92 maybe, IBM decided to quit their own private network and to go forTCP/IP and was the switching point. Everything done for X/OPEN were suddently forgotten. For the mainframes, and certainly in Belgium computing was mainly mainframes, i'm talking about universities here, so when IBM decided to go for TCP/IP we followed even though things were really slow. For example, Belgacom was not interested in running the Domain Name System so we did it here, for some time, starting in 1993 with Pierre Verbaten (https://www.dnsbelgium.be/en/history). Belgacom were focused on X25 (DCS - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X.25) so they missed it.\n\nIt was like the french Minitel ? \nWell, at that time we were really jealous about Minitel. Could you imagine that? Terminals?  At home ? You could work home with a computer ! You could send emails ! All in one, a pc computer with a modem ! \n\nHow did the research about software evolved in the department?\nI am mainly talking about network research but here there were people working on numerical analysis, computing, artificial intelligence ... I was just not involved in those research so i don't know much about it \n\nYou were focused on software and network..\nYes, we did produce some software. We did make software to generate compilers, there was some A.I. software in Prolog, numerical analysis  libraries... Some were sold or shared, it depends.  \nWe did sell some software since the beginning i think when it was not even a department but a professor and a couple of students.\n\nIs it when you joined ? \nNo it was already a department. I did study dutch industrial engeneering in electronics. At the time in electronics you did hear something about computers, i was interested in it i wanted to know more. I heard they had started a year before a degree in computer engeneering. It was the first year where industrial engineer could join. The only thing we knew about computer were in movies. I wanted to know how it work. I'm not sure i still know now even if maybe i have some ideas...\n\nHow many langage do you know ?\nAssembly, FORTRAN, PL-1 the langage invented by IBM to be the universal one, C, Cobol. Perl, i don't know, so more. I'm not fluent in any other langages, but i can read any langage especially well writtened, i know i can understand it and learn it...I know JAVA also. As a system administrator the thing i use most are the command line of UNIX and Perl. But that's because i'm more familiar with those two so it goes faster.\n\nHow did you see the rise of personnal computer and the software that goes with ? \nI have to admit that we missed it. We didn't see that what was new was powerful. We were not impressed by the software. I remember windows 95, the news on TV, people sleeping on the street to get it. I remember when i get my first windows version, with a box of 22 floppies or so. Then i wanted to do something, to compile a program, but there was no compiler. We were used to Unix, a basic system but with a lot of utilities in it. Software was for us free, and we were used to have it free and it was not free anymore. \n\nDoes that mean you didn't had a personnal computer until late ? \nYes. I think it was round 2000. I didn't needed it really. I got one when the belgian UCP network became commercial. Of course i did not get Windows on it.  I think we got Linux here in 1994. There was a guy involved in the kernel studying here. So we did used it very fast.\n\nSo, what is software for you ?\nFor me software is the magic that make computer usable. I can only gives examples of what i mean by it. A PC without software most people, even computer scientists, can't do anything with it. You need basic software. Some software are already integrated in the computer hardware. Same for phones, tablets... The main characteristic, for me, is that it should be user friendly. That is very difficult i know, because you have to imagine what the people using your software are going to do with it and how they want to use it, that's the magic you need to solve.\n\nIs command line user friendly ? \nWell, somehow you have to learn the command langage that is in fact a computer langage where you can make all the constructs that other langages offers.\nYou can create loops, you can test, whatever. It's not so different from computer langages like C or JAVA or whatever. \n\nBut it's already software no ? User friendly depends on what you put behind these words, no ? \nYes it's already software. I don't have a strong opinion about command lines. It depends on people. I can imagine that someone that have never heard about the command line expect that you click somewhere and it happens. But if you know the command langage it's sometimes perhaps easier or productive to type commands and let it run. Sometimes, i find it easier if i have a screen and a number of buttons and i don't have to imagine what happens behind that screen. And sometimes i want to do something with the command, because i'm used to it. That's why i don't trust myself about user friendliness because  i have a strong experience in computer interfaces i'm so used to some of them perhaps i can't even imagine that somebody else would like to do it otherwise.\n\nW\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","attribs":"|1+g*6|2+2*5+3p*6|1+1*5+4f*6|2+2+dm*6|2+2+4n*6|1+1|1+1*5+11*6|2+2+bc*6|2+2+5z*2+3e*3+1*4*3+20*4+1*6|2+2+e7*6|2+2+7n*6|2+2*5+1a*6|2+2+53*6|2+2*5+19*6|2+2+c7*6|2+2*5+1r*6|2+2+jo*6|1+1+41*6|2+2*5+1a*6|2+2+5g*6|2+2*5+2w*6|2+2+l6*6|2+2*5+1f*6|2+2+8f*5+7+kh*6|1+1+uu*0|1+1+9s*0|2+2*5+1v*0|1+1+aj*0|2+2*5+5m*0|1+1+30*0|1+1+48*2+15+9l*0|1+1+1*0|1+1+1*5+1y*0|1+1+tm*0|1+1+1*0|1+1*5+4t*0|1+1+dr*0|1+1+u6*0|2+2*5+x*0|1+1+5q*0|2+2*5+1q*0|1+1+5w*0|2+2*5+16*0|1+1+5b*0|1+1+3l*0|2+2*5+o*0|1+1+df*0|2+2*5+u*0|1+1+bs*0|2+2*5+29*0|1+1+eh*0|2+2*5+1s*0|1+1+7m*0|2+2*5+u*0|1+1+fk*0|2+2*5+w*0|1+1+48*0|1+1+3b*0|2+2*5+2m*0|1+1+l9*0|3+4*6|5+5|1+1"}}},"pad:observatory.guide.jeanhuensitvextended:revs:6501":{"changeset":"Z:cwf<1|2l=cw7-1$","meta":{"author":"a.kqv62Q3nhchdwIuK","timestamp":1518101212669}},"pad:observatory.guide.jeanhuensitvextended:revs:6502":{"changeset":"Z:cwe>1|2l=cw7*0+1$A","meta":{"author":"a.kqv62Q3nhchdwIuK","timestamp":1518101213169}},"pad:observatory.guide.jeanhuensitvextended:revs:6503":{"changeset":"Z:cwf>1|2l=cw7=1*0+1$p","meta":{"author":"a.kqv62Q3nhchdwIuK","timestamp":1518101214122}},"pad:observatory.guide.jeanhuensitvextended:revs:6504":{"changeset":"Z:cwg>4|2l=cw7=2*0+4$art

__NOPUBLISH__\n\n\n**You have been using computers since a long time, as you explained us during the tour we had the joy of assisting during the TGSO.**\n**I heard that that until recently, let's say the late 1990's, when learning computer programming you had to start by  writing down the program on paper... ** \n\nIn 1973, i did study computer sciences, it was the second year of the department, here in Leuven. At the time computers were mainframes and you did fed them with programms by punch cards. Programing was writing down the program, than you punched it and the next day you get results, mostly error. That's the way it worked at that time. To teach us programing, they used the langage of that time, Fortran and some kind of invented assembly langage, it didn't really exist, it was simplified.\n\nMost of the time you did write down your program, the teacher and the assistant would have to tell you what is wrong or good, you didn't had much practical experience.\n\n**How was it like, tons of pages ?** \n\nNo. As an anecdocte, i remember punchcards were a block of papers, we were jealous of the people who came in the computer center with huge stacks of cards. That were really small programs, not complicated one. The fact you had to learn to use the computer from scratch, everything was new, you couldn't rely on previous experiences, everything was new. And to start with small programs was difficult enough. \n\nThat was also the time when Edsger W. Dijkstra who forked the goto... i still remember him, in an audience, giving us a lecture on modernisation in programming at the International computing symposium 1977 in Liège (programming: from craft to scientific discipline https://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/EWD/transcriptions/EWD05xx/EWD566.html). He told usxx (i'll complete it as soon as possible. i need Jean's input)\"\n\nAnd then from 75 on, computers became cheaper and could be bought by departments and smaller entities. And than came the first interactive computer. Still beasts about two cubic meters, costing two millions belgian francs. But it was low enough to allow people to type in directly commands. I started working here in 75 as a researcher, it have evolved continuously and i saw computer getting cheaper and getting easier to use.The way to use it was simplified, you could start to go to the beast and try it out.\n\nI remember more or less: you did write down the program in Fortran for instance… We always thought in the beginning that it would work and it didn't, so after a turn around you were giving it back to the operator and you have to wait half a day or a night to get the results.\n\n**What kind of program you were working on?** \n\nI remember the first program i had to write was you got three numbers, you had to make the program decide if you construct a triangle with the numbers being the sides of the triangle.\n\n**That took an afternoon to be processed ?** \n\nWell, yeah. You had to imagine how to do it which was also one problem, than you prepare the card with the punching machine and you give the package of cards to the operator who was feeeding the computer with the cards. People had the taks to fed the computers by hands, with paper, cards, than disks and it lasts onto the magnetic disks period. And after a number of hours or a night you get a listing, a piece of paper, with the results.\n\n**When where you able to record the program onto the machine?**\n\nI think that happens between 75 and 80. After the punching cards which was already a way to record the program, we had  typewriters, terminals but we could record the programs, we could store them on the computer. We had magnetic discs. IBM had number for everything, i remember the 33-30 [manufactured from 1970 on] had a magnetic disk. We didn't touch the machines, operators would change the disks, we could only access the typewriter. That was our most direct connexion to the computer. Thetimes were diffent. The mainframes were such huge costly beasts that it had operators day and night keeping it busy. Even at night there were two or three guys mounting tapes, dismounting tapes, that kind of stuff.\nhttps://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/42/IBM_magnetic_disk_drives_3330%2B3333.png/600px-IBM_magnetic_disk_drives_3330%2B3333.png\n\n**When did you stop working with operators?** \n\nSomewhere between 85 and 90. There were still operators at the main computer of the university, but there were also small computers, so researchers and student can have direct access when needed. \n\n**When did you start to work with software sold by others or gived away in order to do your research?** \n\nYou stil need an operating system on the mainframe that was delivered by IBM or the constructor delivering the mainframe. When you bought mini-computers, which were the  smaller versions of mainframes, in most cases you did buy an operating systems, compilers and all the stuff you need to be able to program those things. In most cases, because the computer sciences department did buy the mini-computer from, for instance *digital equipment corporation*,  a manufactorer of that time, but they didn't buy their software. They were not open source or free,  but you could get Unix and could run it on those digital equipment (DEC) computers. That is what the computer department of the University of Louvain la Neuve *l'unité d'informatique*, did and so did we.\n\n**When did you start working with unix as an os?** \n\nI took a trip to Amsterdam, it must have been in 1979/80… Well, the story starts in our french sister university (LLN) where they did have a PDP-11 with Unix on it https://hackadaycom.files.wordpress.com/2016/08/full-size-pdp11.jpg. You got Unix, at the time, when you were a university, from Bell Aps (Ma Bell), the american telephone company. It was a mega organisation at the time [before the [dismantlment of AT&T/Bell system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breakup_of_the_Bell_System)].Due to monopoly, the US authorities splitted up in different Baby Bells. One of the restriction was there was a research baby bell, they couldn't really sell anything.There were computer scientists there, who did developped some Unix interesting things.  For universities you did get the source and no support for free. How to install it, no idea. In Unité d'informatique, they were lucky: they got the same computer that unix were developped on.  They got the disk by snail mail as a post-office package. They mounted it and it did spin up and they had it.\nHere, we did have a cheaper PDP11 (DEC - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PDP-11) We go the disk source from Bell Aps but we could not run it. We could look at it but that was all, because our disc format was different than the one at Bell Aps. Somebody here did write a driver for that disk and we did compiled it in l'unité d'informatique of LLN.  it did compile it but we couldn't try it because we did not have So we find the nearest Unix system compatiblewith ours, it was in Amsterdam.  Andrew Tenebaum who did write since then a number of books about operating systems and became quite an authority. He was working there. It was the young Tanenbaum, just arriving from United States to Amsterdam. He was learning to speak dutch. We did understood his english better but his assistant insisted that he speaks dutch because he will have to pass an exam in dutch. There we got a disk, than also the one with the driver we compiled, than we got here and we start using Unix.  Than in my opinion the start of open source was Unix because we had to maintain it by ourselves and we learned a lot from the sources.\nIn that time we did had to get software and it brings us to different places. For example, at the time the agents at the custom at the airport or post didn't know what to do with the discs in terms of custom clearance. They used magnetic or xrays, we had to write on the package that it should not be x-rayed. But we got time to time unreadable discs. \n\n**So it took like weeks between the transportation, the custom...**\nYes, the custom had to clear the packages. I remember i've been in the customs in Zaventem. I had received a letter that my package from Bell Aps had arrived. I went there thinking i would have to pay something and go. But no. It had to be cleared so there wa some organisation that had to do administrative stuff, so i only got it a few days later. The response time was huge :)\n\n**Than after that period of time how did you switch from that kind of collaboration on how to make software and make software work to collaboration on networks, between universities and researchers...**\nIn the Unix system of that time there was a kind of networking protocol which only did work on serial lines.\n You could connect two unix systems together you only need a line. We had one between LLN and Leuven, it's only 15 kms, but we had to ask Belgacom, than La Régie des télégraphes et téléphones, to get a modem to connect through their network and than over that modem you could reach an amazing speed of 300 characters per second. And that was the first communication. It did happened somewhere around 85. And then you had connexion with another computer, writing something here and do  something. And we could send programs to each other. \n \n **What was the first thing you did send through a network like this?**\n I didn't do it myself, i remember it was a kind of chat program. And on LLN side was Elie Milgrom, he is retired now. On this side, it was Pr Willems. And i remember that they typed something and they got a response from the other side and that was it.  But i remember that Pr Willems sent \"ok we stop now\". And that Elie Milgrom answered \"See you later, Alligator\" [a reference to Bill Haley and the Comets].  At the time we still had these kind of songs in mind. (lol). Those Unix to Unix connexions were first. And there was a worldwide Unix to Unix based network, Usenet (1979), it still exists somewhere... you can download load  of illegal movies and that stuff, that was not what we meant at the time. But that is what is left. And Usenet became gradually replaced by the Internet in USA. In Europe, the Internet came a lot later, but we had access to the Internet, we could send mail to them and we could receive mail from them, because some friendly american university, later companies, did translate internet mail to UCP mail. That was before the 1990's.\n \n **Your relation to software had changed at the time because you did not have to do all this manipulations with the software your received... Was it already floppy discs ?**\n No, magnetic tapes, for the mainframe at least. Most of the mini-computers had some cheaper magnetic tapes. Between 90 and 95 the main machines for the software institute was a VAX from DEC. Once a year the software came from Berkeley, it was still Unix but modified by Berkeley for virtual memory and all the stuff which are common now. We received a tape, with lot of goodies, i still remember we didn't know what was on there but we scrutinised there to know what was there, what we can use.\nIn Europe, companies like Siemens were trying to set up software centers to make software avaiable, they were even trying to set up networks. Researchers did love the Internet, it worked, it was useful for their researchs. So companies in Europe, were trying to set up their own networks, i remember for example the X/OPEN transport protocol. Their was a lot of standards about what software layers should do, but it didn't succeed because sometime, 92 maybe, IBM decided to quit their own private network and to go forTCP/IP and was the switching point. Everything done for X/OPEN were suddently forgotten. For the mainframes, and certainly in Belgium computing was mainly mainframes, i'm talking about universities here, so when IBM decided to go for TCP/IP we followed even though things were really slow. For example, Belgacom was not interested in running the Domain Name System so we did it here, for some time, starting in 1993 with Pierre Verbaten (https://www.dnsbelgium.be/en/history). Belgacom were focused on X25 (DCS - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X.25) so they missed it.\n\nIt was like the french Minitel ? \nWell, at that time we were really jealous about Minitel. Could you imagine that? Terminals?  At home ? You could work home with a computer ! You could send emails ! All in one, a pc computer with a modem ! \n\nHow did the research about software evolved in the department?\nI am mainly talking about network research but here there were people working on numerical analysis, computing, artificial intelligence ... I was just not involved in those research so i don't know much about it \n\nYou were focused on software and network..\nYes, we did produce some software. We did make software to generate compilers, there was some A.I. software in Prolog, numerical analysis  libraries... Some were sold or shared, it depends.  \nWe did sell some software since the beginning i think when it was not even a department but a professor and a couple of students.\n\nIs it when you joined ? \nNo it was already a department. I did study dutch industrial engeneering in electronics. At the time in electronics you did hear something about computers, i was interested in it i wanted to know more. I heard they had started a year before a degree in computer engeneering. It was the first year where industrial engineer could join. The only thing we knew about computer were in movies. I wanted to know how it work. I'm not sure i still know now even if maybe i have some ideas...\n\nHow many langage do you know ?\nAssembly, FORTRAN, PL-1 the langage invented by IBM to be the universal one, C, Cobol. Perl, i don't know, so more. I'm not fluent in any other langages, but i can read any langage especially well writtened, i know i can understand it and learn it...I know JAVA also. As a system administrator the thing i use most are the command line of UNIX and Perl. But that's because i'm more familiar with those two so it goes faster.\n\nHow did you see the rise of personnal computer and the software that goes with ? \nI have to admit that we missed it. We didn't see that what was new was powerful. We were not impressed by the software. I remember windows 95, the news on TV, people sleeping on the street to get it. I remember when i get my first windows version, with a box of 22 floppies or so. Then i wanted to do something, to compile a program, but there was no compiler. We were used to Unix, a basic system but with a lot of utilities in it. Software was for us free, and we were used to have it free and it was not free anymore. \n\nDoes that mean you didn't had a personnal computer until late ? \nYes. I think it was round 2000. I didn't needed it really. I got one when the belgian UCP network became commercial. Of course i did not get Windows on it.  I think we got Linux here in 1994. There was a guy involved in the kernel studying here. So we did used it very fast.\n\nSo, what is software for you ?\nFor me software is the magic that make computer usable. I can only gives examples of what i mean by it. A PC without software most people, even computer scientists, can't do anything with it. You need basic software. Some software are already integrated in the computer hardware. Same for phones, tablets... The main characteristic, for me, is that it should be user friendly. That is very difficult i know, because you have to imagine what the people using your software are going to do with it and how they want to use it, that's the magic you need to solve.\n\nIs command line user friendly ? \nWell, somehow you have to learn the command langage that is in fact a computer langage where you can make all the constructs that other langages offers.\nYou can create loops, you can test, whatever. It's not so different from computer langages like C or JAVA or whatever. \n\nBut it's already software no ? User friendly depends on what you put behind these words, no ? \nYes it's already software. I don't have a strong opinion about command lines. It depends on people. I can imagine that someone that have never heard about the command line expect that you click somewhere and it happens. But if you know the command langage it's sometimes perhaps easier or productive to type commands and let it run. Sometimes, i find it easier if i have a screen and a number of buttons and i don't have to imagine what happens behind that screen. And sometimes i want to do something with the command line, because i'm used to it. That's why i don't trust myself about user friendliness because i have a  experience in computer interfaces i'm so used to some of them perhaps i can't even imagine that somebody else would like to do it otherwise.\n\nApart from maintaining the museum, what do you work on ? You are still active in the department even though you are retired ? \nI work on sensors and the internet of things.\n\n\n\n\n\n","attribs":"|1+g*6|2+2*5+3p*6|1+1*5+4f*6|2+2+dm*6|2+2+4n*6|1+1|1+1*5+11*6|2+2+bc*6|2+2+5z*2+3e*3+1*4*3+20*4+1*6|2+2+e7*6|2+2+7n*6|2+2*5+1a*6|2+2+53*6|2+2*5+19*6|2+2+c7*6|2+2*5+1r*6|2+2+jo*6|1+1+41*6|2+2*5+1a*6|2+2+5g*6|2+2*5+2w*6|2+2+l6*6|2+2*5+1f*6|2+2+8f*5+7+kh*6|1+1+uu*0|1+1+9s*0|2+2*5+1v*0|1+1+aj*0|2+2*5+5m*0|1+1+30*0|1+1+48*2+15+9l*0|1+1+1*0|1+1+1*5+1y*0|1+1+tm*0|1+1+1*0|1+1*5+4t*0|1+1+dr*0|1+1+u6*0|2+2*5+x*0|1+1+5q*0|2+2*5+1q*0|1+1+5w*0|2+2*5+16*0|1+1+5b*0|1+1+3l*0|2+2*5+o*0|1+1+df*0|2+2*5+u*0|1+1+bs*0|2+2*5+29*0|1+1+eh*0|2+2*5+1s*0|1+1+7m*0|2+2*5+u*0|1+1+fk*0|2+2*5+w*0|1+1+48*0|1+1+3b*0|2+2*5+2m*0|1+1+ee*0+5+6o*0|2+2*5+3i*0|1+1+19*6|5+5|1+1"}}},"pad:observatory.guide.jeanhuensitvextended:revs:6601":{"changeset":"Z:d13>2|2j=caw=ha*0+2$lo","meta":{"author":"a.kqv62Q3nhchdwIuK","timestamp":1518101428954}},"pad:observatory.guide.jeanhuensitvextended:revs:6602":{"changeset":"Z:d15>2|2j=caw=hc*0+2$ng","meta":{"author":"a.kqv62Q3nhchdwIuK","timestamp":1518101429455}},"pad:observatory.guide.jeanhuensitvextended:revs:6603":{"changeset":"Z:d17>1|2j=caw=ic*0+1$.","meta":{"author":"a.kqv62Q3nhchdwIuK","timestamp":1518101432536}},"pad:observatory.guide.jeanhuensitvextended:revs:6604":{"changeset":"Z:d18<1|2j=caw=ie-1$","meta":{"author":"a.kqv62Q3nhchdwIuK","timestamp":1518101434756}},"pad:observatory.guide.jeanhuensitvextended:revs:6605":{"changeset":"Z:d17>1|2j=caw=ie*0+1$I","meta":{"author":"a.kqv62Q3nhchdwIuK","timestamp":1518101435474}},"pad:observatory.guide.jeanhuensitvextended:revs:6606":{"changeset":"Z:d18>1|2j=caw=lb*0+1$

__NOPUBLISH__\n\n\n**You have been using computers since a long time, as you explained us during the tour we had the joy of assisting during the TGSO.**\n**I heard that that until recently, let's say the late 1990's, when learning computer programming you had to start by  writing down the program on paper... ** \n\nIn 1973, i did study computer sciences, it was the second year of the department, here in Leuven. At the time computers were mainframes and you did fed them with programms by punch cards. Programing was writing down the program, than you punched it and the next day you get results, mostly error. That's the way it worked at that time. To teach us programing, they used the langage of that time, Fortran and some kind of invented assembly langage, it didn't really exist, it was simplified.\n\nMost of the time you did write down your program, the teacher and the assistant would have to tell you what is wrong or good, you didn't had much practical experience.\n\n**How was it like, tons of pages ?** \n\nNo. As an anecdocte, i remember punchcards were a block of papers, we were jealous of the people who came in the computer center with huge stacks of cards. That were really small programs, not complicated one. The fact you had to learn to use the computer from scratch, everything was new, you couldn't rely on previous experiences, everything was new. And to start with small programs was difficult enough. \n\nThat was also the time when Edsger W. Dijkstra who forked the goto... i still remember him, in an audience, giving us a lecture on modernisation in programming at the International computing symposium 1977 in Liège (programming: from craft to scientific discipline https://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/EWD/transcriptions/EWD05xx/EWD566.html). He told usxx (i'll complete it as soon as possible. i need Jean's input)\"\n\nAnd then from 75 on, computers became cheaper and could be bought by departments and smaller entities. And than came the first interactive computer. Still beasts about two cubic meters, costing two millions belgian francs. But it was low enough to allow people to type in directly commands. I started working here in 75 as a researcher, it have evolved continuously and i saw computer getting cheaper and getting easier to use.The way to use it was simplified, you could start to go to the beast and try it out.\n\nI remember more or less: you did write down the program in Fortran for instance… We always thought in the beginning that it would work and it didn't, so after a turn around you were giving it back to the operator and you have to wait half a day or a night to get the results.\n\n**What kind of program you were working on?** \n\nI remember the first program i had to write was you got three numbers, you had to make the program decide if you construct a triangle with the numbers being the sides of the triangle.\n\n**That took an afternoon to be processed ?** \n\nWell, yeah. You had to imagine how to do it which was also one problem, than you prepare the card with the punching machine and you give the package of cards to the operator who was feeeding the computer with the cards. People had the taks to fed the computers by hands, with paper, cards, than disks and it lasts onto the magnetic disks period. And after a number of hours or a night you get a listing, a piece of paper, with the results.\n\n**When where you able to record the program onto the machine?**\n\nI think that happens between 75 and 80. After the punching cards which was already a way to record the program, we had  typewriters, terminals but we could record the programs, we could store them on the computer. We had magnetic discs. IBM had number for everything, i remember the 33-30 [manufactured from 1970 on] had a magnetic disk. We didn't touch the machines, operators would change the disks, we could only access the typewriter. That was our most direct connexion to the computer. Thetimes were diffent. The mainframes were such huge costly beasts that it had operators day and night keeping it busy. Even at night there were two or three guys mounting tapes, dismounting tapes, that kind of stuff.\nhttps://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/42/IBM_magnetic_disk_drives_3330%2B3333.png/600px-IBM_magnetic_disk_drives_3330%2B3333.png\n\n**When did you stop working with operators?** \n\nSomewhere between 85 and 90. There were still operators at the main computer of the university, but there were also small computers, so researchers and student can have direct access when needed. \n\n**When did you start to work with software sold by others or gived away in order to do your research?** \n\nYou stil need an operating system on the mainframe that was delivered by IBM or the constructor delivering the mainframe. When you bought mini-computers, which were the  smaller versions of mainframes, in most cases you did buy an operating systems, compilers and all the stuff you need to be able to program those things. In most cases, because the computer sciences department did buy the mini-computer from, for instance *digital equipment corporation*,  a manufactorer of that time, but they didn't buy their software. They were not open source or free,  but you could get Unix and could run it on those digital equipment (DEC) computers. That is what the computer department of the University of Louvain la Neuve *l'unité d'informatique*, did and so did we.\n\n**When did you start working with unix as an os?** \n\nI took a trip to Amsterdam, it must have been in 1979/80… Well, the story starts in our french sister university (LLN) where they did have a PDP-11 with Unix on it https://hackadaycom.files.wordpress.com/2016/08/full-size-pdp11.jpg. You got Unix, at the time, when you were a university, from Bell Aps (Ma Bell), the american telephone company. It was a mega organisation at the time [before the [dismantlment of AT&T/Bell system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breakup_of_the_Bell_System)].Due to monopoly, the US authorities splitted up in different Baby Bells. One of the restriction was there was a research baby bell, they couldn't really sell anything.There were computer scientists there, who did developped some Unix interesting things.  For universities you did get the source and no support for free. How to install it, no idea. In Unité d'informatique, they were lucky: they got the same computer that unix were developped on.  They got the disk by snail mail as a post-office package. They mounted it and it did spin up and they had it.\nHere, we did have a cheaper PDP11 (DEC - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PDP-11) We go the disk source from Bell Aps but we could not run it. We could look at it but that was all, because our disc format was different than the one at Bell Aps. Somebody here did write a driver for that disk and we did compiled it in l'unité d'informatique of LLN.  it did compile it but we couldn't try it because we did not have So we find the nearest Unix system compatiblewith ours, it was in Amsterdam.  Andrew Tenebaum who did write since then a number of books about operating systems and became quite an authority. He was working there. It was the young Tanenbaum, just arriving from United States to Amsterdam. He was learning to speak dutch. We did understood his english better but his assistant insisted that he speaks dutch because he will have to pass an exam in dutch. There we got a disk, than also the one with the driver we compiled, than we got here and we start using Unix.  Than in my opinion the start of open source was Unix because we had to maintain it by ourselves and we learned a lot from the sources.\nIn that time we did had to get software and it brings us to different places. For example, at the time the agents at the custom at the airport or post didn't know what to do with the discs in terms of custom clearance. They used magnetic or xrays, we had to write on the package that it should not be x-rayed. But we got time to time unreadable discs. \n\n**So it took like weeks between the transportation, the custom...**\nYes, the custom had to clear the packages. I remember i've been in the customs in Zaventem. I had received a letter that my package from Bell Aps had arrived. I went there thinking i would have to pay something and go. But no. It had to be cleared so there wa some organisation that had to do administrative stuff, so i only got it a few days later. The response time was huge :)\n\n**Than after that period of time how did you switch from that kind of collaboration on how to make software and make software work to collaboration on networks, between universities and researchers...**\nIn the Unix system of that time there was a kind of networking protocol which only did work on serial lines.\n You could connect two unix systems together you only need a line. We had one between LLN and Leuven, it's only 15 kms, but we had to ask Belgacom, than La Régie des télégraphes et téléphones, to get a modem to connect through their network and than over that modem you could reach an amazing speed of 300 characters per second. And that was the first communication. It did happened somewhere around 85. And then you had connexion with another computer, writing something here and do  something. And we could send programs to each other. \n \n **What was the first thing you did send through a network like this?**\n I didn't do it myself, i remember it was a kind of chat program. And on LLN side was Elie Milgrom, he is retired now. On this side, it was Pr Willems. And i remember that they typed something and they got a response from the other side and that was it.  But i remember that Pr Willems sent \"ok we stop now\". And that Elie Milgrom answered \"See you later, Alligator\" [a reference to Bill Haley and the Comets].  At the time we still had these kind of songs in mind. (lol). Those Unix to Unix connexions were first. And there was a worldwide Unix to Unix based network, Usenet (1979), it still exists somewhere... you can download load  of illegal movies and that stuff, that was not what we meant at the time. But that is what is left. And Usenet became gradually replaced by the Internet in USA. In Europe, the Internet came a lot later, but we had access to the Internet, we could send mail to them and we could receive mail from them, because some friendly american university, later companies, did translate internet mail to UCP mail. That was before the 1990's.\n \n **Your relation to software had changed at the time because you did not have to do all this manipulations with the software your received... Was it already floppy discs ?**\n No, magnetic tapes, for the mainframe at least. Most of the mini-computers had some cheaper magnetic tapes. Between 90 and 95 the main machines for the software institute was a VAX from DEC. Once a year the software came from Berkeley, it was still Unix but modified by Berkeley for virtual memory and all the stuff which are common now. We received a tape, with lot of goodies, i still remember we didn't know what was on there but we scrutinised there to know what was there, what we can use.\nIn Europe, companies like Siemens were trying to set up software centers to make software avaiable, they were even trying to set up networks. Researchers did love the Internet, it worked, it was useful for their researchs. So companies in Europe, were trying to set up their own networks, i remember for example the X/OPEN transport protocol. Their was a lot of standards about what software layers should do, but it didn't succeed because sometime, 92 maybe, IBM decided to quit their own private network and to go forTCP/IP and was the switching point. Everything done for X/OPEN were suddently forgotten. For the mainframes, and certainly in Belgium computing was mainly mainframes, i'm talking about universities here, so when IBM decided to go for TCP/IP we followed even though things were really slow. For example, Belgacom was not interested in running the Domain Name System so we did it here, for some time, starting in 1993 with Pierre Verbaten (https://www.dnsbelgium.be/en/history). Belgacom were focused on X25 (DCS - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X.25) so they missed it.\n\nIt was like the french Minitel ? \nWell, at that time we were really jealous about Minitel. Could you imagine that? Terminals?  At home ? You could work home with a computer ! You could send emails ! All in one, a pc computer with a modem ! \n\nHow did the research about software evolved in the department?\nI am mainly talking about network research but here there were people working on numerical analysis, computing, artificial intelligence ... I was just not involved in those research so i don't know much about it \n\nYou were focused on software and network..\nYes, we did produce some software. We did make software to generate compilers, there was some A.I. software in Prolog, numerical analysis  libraries... Some were sold or shared, it depends.  \nWe did sell some software since the beginning i think when it was not even a department but a professor and a couple of students.\n\nIs it when you joined ? \nNo it was already a department. I did study dutch industrial engeneering in electronics. At the time in electronics you did hear something about computers, i was interested in it i wanted to know more. I heard they had started a year before a degree in computer engeneering. It was the first year where industrial engineer could join. The only thing we knew about computer were in movies. I wanted to know how it work. I'm not sure i still know now even if maybe i have some ideas...\n\nHow many langage do you know ?\nAssembly, FORTRAN, PL-1 the langage invented by IBM to be the universal one, C, Cobol. Perl, i don't know, so more. I'm not fluent in any other langages, but i can read any langage especially well writtened, i know i can understand it and learn it...I know JAVA also. As a system administrator the thing i use most are the command line of UNIX and Perl. But that's because i'm more familiar with those two so it goes faster.\n\nHow did you see the rise of personnal computer and the software that goes with ? \nI have to admit that we missed it. We didn't see that what was new was powerful. We were not impressed by the software. I remember windows 95, the news on TV, people sleeping on the street to get it. I remember when i get my first windows version, with a box of 22 floppies or so. Then i wanted to do something, to compile a program, but there was no compiler. We were used to Unix, a basic system but with a lot of utilities in it. Software was for us free, and we were used to have it free and it was not free anymore. \n\nDoes that mean you didn't had a personnal computer until late ? \nYes. I think it was round 2000. I didn't needed it really. I got one when the belgian UCP network became commercial. Of course i did not get Windows on it.  I think we got Linux here in 1994. There was a guy involved in the kernel studying here. So we did used it very fast.\n\nSo, what is software for you ?\nFor me software is the magic that make computer usable. I can only gives examples of what i mean by it. A PC without software most people, even computer scientists, can't do anything with it. You need basic software. Some software are already integrated in the computer hardware. Same for phones, tablets... The main characteristic, for me, is that it should be user friendly. That is very difficult i know, because you have to imagine what the people using your software are going to do with it and how they want to use it, that's the magic you need to solve.\n\nIs command line user friendly ? \nWell, somehow you have to learn the command langage that is in fact a computer langage where you can make all the constructs that other langages offers.\nYou can create loops, you can test, whatever. It's not so different from computer langages like C or JAVA or whatever. \n\nBut it's already software no ? User friendly depends on what you put behind these words, no ? \nYes it's already software. I don't have a strong opinion about command lines. It depends on people. I can imagine that someone that have never heard about the command line expect that you click somewhere and it happens. But if you know the command langage it's sometimes perhaps easier or productive to type commands and let it run. Sometimes, i find it easier if i have a screen and a number of buttons and i don't have to imagine what happens behind that screen.

the joy of assisting during the TGSO.**\n**I heard that that until recently, let's say the late 1990's, when learning computer programming you had to start by  writing down the program on paper... ** \n\nIn 1973, i did study computer sciences, it was the second year of the department, here in Leuven. At the time computers were mainframes and you did fed them with programms by punch cards. Programing was writing down the program, than you punched it and the next day you get results, mostly error. That's the way it worked at that time. To teach us programing, they used the langage of that time, Fortran and some kind of invented assembly langage, it didn't really exist, it was simplified.\n\nMost of the time you did write down your program, the teacher and the assistant would have to tell you what is wrong or good, you didn't had much practical experience.\n\n**How was it like, tons of pages ?** \n\nNo. As an anecdocte, i remember punchcards were a block of papers, we were jealous of the people who came in the computer center with huge stacks of cards. That were really small programs, not complicated one. The fact you had to learn to use the computer from scratch, everything was new, you couldn't rely on previous experiences, everything was new. And to start with small programs was difficult enough. \n\nThat was also the time when Edsger W. Dijkstra who forked the goto... i still remember him, in an audience, giving us a lecture on modernisation in programming at the International computing symposium 1977 in Liège (programming: from craft to scientific discipline https://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/EWD/transcriptions/EWD05xx/EWD566.html). He told usxx (i'll complete it as soon as possible. i need Jean's input)\"\n\nAnd then from 75 on, computers became cheaper and could be bought by departments and smaller entities. And than came the first interactive computer. Still beasts about two cubic meters, costing two millions belgian francs. But it was low enough to allow people to type in directly commands. I started working here in 75 as a researcher, it have evolved continuously and i saw computer getting cheaper and getting easier to use.The way to use it was simplified, you could start to go to the beast and try it out.\n\nI remember more or less: you did write down the program in Fortran for instance… We always thought in the beginning that it would work and it didn't, so after a turn around you were giving it back to the operator and you have to wait half a day or a night to get the results.\n\n**What kind of program you were working on?** \n\nI remember the first program i had to write was you got three numbers, you had to make the program decide if you construct a triangle with the numbers being the sides of the triangle.\n\n**That took an afternoon to be processed ?** \n\nWell, yeah. You had to imagine how to do it which was also one problem, than you prepare the card with the punching machine and you give the package of cards to the operator who was feeeding the computer with the cards. People had the taks to fed the computers by hands, with paper, cards, than disks and it lasts onto the magnetic disks period. And after a number of hours or a night you get a listing, a piece of paper, with the results.\n\n**When where you able to record the program onto the machine?**\n\nI think that happens between 75 and 80. After the punching cards which was already a way to record the program, we had  typewriters, terminals but we could record the programs, we could store them on the computer. We had magnetic discs. IBM had number for everything, i remember the 33-30 [manufactured from 1970 on] had a magnetic disk. We didn't touch the machines, operators would change the disks, we could only access the typewriter. That was our most direct connexion to the computer. Thetimes were diffent. The mainframes were such huge costly beasts that it had operators day and night keeping it busy. Even at night there were two or three guys mounting tapes, dismounting tapes, that kind of stuff.\nhttps://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/42/IBM_magnetic_disk_drives_3330%2B3333.png/600px-IBM_magnetic_disk_drives_3330%2B3333.png\n\n**When did you stop working with operators?** \n\nSomewhere between 85 and 90. There were still operators at the main computer of the university, but there were also small computers, so researchers and student can have direct access when needed. \n\n**When did you start to work with software sold by others or gived away in order to do your research?** \n\nYou stil need an operating system on the mainframe that was delivered by IBM or the constructor delivering the mainframe. When you bought mini-computers, which were the  smaller versions of mainframes, in most cases you did buy an operating systems, compilers and all the stuff you need to be able to program those things. In most cases, because the computer sciences department did buy the mini-computer from, for instance *digital equipment corporation*,  a manufactorer of that time, but they didn't buy their software. They were not open source or free,  but you could get Unix and could run it on those digital equipment (DEC) computers. That is what the computer department of the University of Louvain la Neuve *l'unité d'informatique*, did and so did we.\n\n**When did you start working with unix as an os?** \n\nI took a trip to Amsterdam, it must have been in 1979/80… Well, the story starts in our french sister university (LLN) where they did have a PDP-11 with Unix on it https://hackadaycom.files.wordpress.com/2016/08/full-size-pdp11.jpg. You got Unix, at the time, when you were a university, from Bell Aps (Ma Bell), the american telephone company. It was a mega organisation at the time [before the [dismantlment of AT&T/Bell system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breakup_of_the_Bell_System)].Due to monopoly, the US authorities splitted up in different Baby Bells. One of the restriction was there was a research baby bell, they couldn't really sell anything.There were computer scientists there, who did developped some Unix interesting things.  For universities you did get the source and no support for free. How to install it, no idea. In Unité d'informatique, they were lucky: they got the same computer that unix were developped on.  They got the disk by snail mail as a post-office package. They mounted it and it did spin up and they had it.\nHere, we did have a cheaper PDP11 (DEC - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PDP-11) We go the disk source from Bell Aps but we could not run it. We could look at it but that was all, because our disc format was different than the one at Bell Aps. Somebody here did write a driver for that disk and we did compiled it in l'unité d'informatique of LLN.  it did compile it but we couldn't try it because we did not have So we find the nearest Unix system compatiblewith ours, it was in Amsterdam.  Andrew Tenebaum who did write since then a number of books about operating systems and became quite an authority. He was working there. It was the young Tanenbaum, just arriving from United States to Amsterdam. He was learning to speak dutch. We did understood his english better but his assistant insisted that he speaks dutch because he will have to pass an exam in dutch. There we got a disk, than also the one with the driver we compiled, than we got here and we start using Unix.  Than in my opinion the start of open source was Unix because we had to maintain it by ourselves and we learned a lot from the sources.\nIn that time we did had to get software and it brings us to different places. For example, at the time the agents at the custom at the airport or post didn't know what to do with the discs in terms of custom clearance. They used magnetic or xrays, we had to write on the package that it should not be x-rayed. But we got time to time unreadable discs. \n\n**So it took like weeks between the transportation, the custom...**\nYes, the custom had to clear the packages. I remember i've been in the customs in Zaventem. I had received a letter that my package from Bell Aps had arrived. I went there thinking i would have to pay something and go. But no. It had to be cleared so there wa some organisation that had to do administrative stuff, so i only got it a few days later. The response time was huge :)\n\n**Than after that period of time how did you switch from that kind of collaboration on how to make software and make software work to collaboration on networks, between universities and researchers...**\nIn the Unix system of that time there was a kind of networking protocol which only did work on serial lines.\n You could connect two unix systems together you only need a line. We had one between LLN and Leuven, it's only 15 kms, but we had to ask Belgacom, than La Régie des télégraphes et téléphones, to get a modem to connect through their network and than over that modem you could reach an amazing speed of 300 characters per second. And that was the first communication. It did happened somewhere around 85. And then you had connexion with another computer, writing something here and do  something. And we could send programs to each other. \n \n **What was the first thing you did send through a network like this?**\n I didn't do it myself, i remember it was a kind of chat program. And on LLN side was Elie Milgrom, he is retired now. On this side, it was Pr Willems. And i remember that they typed something and they got a response from the other side and that was it.  But i remember that Pr Willems sent \"ok we stop now\". And that Elie Milgrom answered \"See you later, Alligator\" [a reference to Bill Haley and the Comets].  At the time we still had these kind of songs in mind. (lol). Those Unix to Unix connexions were first. And there was a worldwide Unix to Unix based network, Usenet (1979), it still exists somewhere... you can download load  of illegal movies and that stuff, that was not what we meant at the time. But that is what is left. And Usenet became gradually replaced by the Internet in USA. In Europe, the Internet came a lot later, but we had access to the Internet, we could send mail to them and we could receive mail from them, because some friendly american university, later companies, did translate internet mail to UCP mail. That was before the 1990's.\n \n **Your relation to software had changed at the time because you did not have to do all this manipulations with the software your received... Was it already floppy discs ?**\n No, magnetic tapes, for the mainframe at least. Most of the mini-computers had some cheaper magnetic tapes. Between 90 and 95 the main machines for the software institute was a VAX from DEC. Once a year the software came from Berkeley, it was still Unix but modified by Berkeley for virtual memory and all the stuff which are common now. We received a tape, with lot of goodies, i still remember we didn't know what was on there but we scrutinised there to know what was there, what we can use.\nIn Europe, companies like Siemens were trying to set up software centers to make software avaiable, they were even trying to set up networks. Researchers did love the Internet, it worked, it was useful for their researchs. So companies in Europe, were trying to set up their own networks, i remember for example the X/OPEN transport protocol. Their was a lot of standards about what software layers should do, but it didn't succeed because sometime, 92 maybe, IBM decided to quit their own private network and to go forTCP/IP and was the switching point. Everything done for X/OPEN were suddently forgotten. For the mainframes, and certainly in Belgium computing was mainly mainframes, i'm talking about universities here, so when IBM decided to go for TCP/IP we followed even though things were really slow. For example, Belgacom was not interested in running the Domain Name System so we did it here, for some time, starting in 1993 with Pierre Verbaten (https://www.dnsbelgium.be/en/history). Belgacom were focused on X25 (DCS - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X.25) so they missed it.\n\nIt was like the french Minitel ? \nWell, at that time we were really jealous about Minitel. Could you imagine that? Terminals?  At home ? You could work home with a computer ! You could send emails ! All in one, a pc computer with a modem ! \n\nHow did the research about software evolved in the department?\nI am mainly talking about network research but here there were people working on numerical analysis, computing, artificial intelligence ... I was just not involved in those research so i don't know much about it \n\nYou were focused on software and network..\nYes, we did produce some software. We did make software to generate compilers, there was some A.I. software in Prolog, numerical analysis  libraries... Some were sold or shared, it depends.  \nWe did sell some software since the beginning i think when it was not even a department but a professor and a couple of students.\n\nIs it when you joined ? \nNo it was already a department. I did study dutch industrial engeneering in electronics. At the time in electronics you did hear something about computers, i was interested in it i wanted to know more. I heard they had started a year before a degree in computer engeneering. It was the first year where industrial engineer could join. The only thing we knew about computer were in movies. I wanted to know how it work. I'm not sure i still know now even if maybe i have some ideas...\n\nHow many langage do you know ?\nAssembly, FORTRAN, PL-1 the langage invented by IBM to be the universal one, C, Cobol. Perl, i don't know, so more. I'm not fluent in any other langages, but i can read any langage especially well writtened, i know i can understand it and learn it...I know JAVA also. As a system administrator the thing i use most are the command line of UNIX and Perl. But that's because i'm more familiar with those two so it goes faster.\n\nHow did you see the rise of personnal computer and the software that goes with ? \nI have to admit that we missed it. We didn't see that what was new was powerful. We were not impressed by the software. I remember windows 95, the news on TV, people sleeping on the street to get it. I remember when i get my first windows version, with a box of 22 floppies or so. Then i wanted to do something, to compile a program, but there was no compiler. We were used to Unix, a basic system but with a lot of utilities in it. Software was for us free, and we were used to have it free and it was not free anymore. \n\nDoes that mean you didn't had a personnal computer until late ? \nYes. I think it was round 2000. I didn't needed it really. I got one when the belgian UCP network became commercial. Of course i did not get Windows on it.  I think we got Linux here in 1994. There was a guy involved in the kernel studying here. So we did used it very fast.\n\nSo, what is software for you ?\nFor me software is the magic that make computer usable. I can only gives examples of what i mean by it. A PC without software most people, even computer scientists, can't do anything with it. You need basic software. Some software are already integrated in the computer hardware. Same for phones, tablets... The main characteristic, for me, is that it should be user friendly. That is very difficult i know, because you have to imagine what the people using your software are going to do with it and how they want to use it, that's the magic you need to solve.\n\nIs command line user friendly ? \nWell, somehow you have to learn the command langage that is in fact a computer langage where you can make all the constructs that other langages offers.\nYou can create loops, you can test, whatever. It's not so different from computer langages like C or JAVA or whatever. \n\nBut it's already software no ? User friendly depends on what you put behind these words, no ? \nYes it's already software. I don't have a strong opinion about command lines. It depends on people. I can imagine that someone that have never heard about the command line expect that you click somewhere and it happens. But if you know the command langage it's sometimes perhaps easier or productive to type commands and let it run. Sometimes, i find it easier if i have a screen and a number of buttons and i don't have to imagine what happens behind that screen. And sometimes i want to do something with the command line, because i'm used to it. That's why i don't trust myself about user friendliness because i have a long experience in computer interfaces. I'm so used to some of them perhaps i can't even imagine that somebody else would like to do it otherwise or doesn't like what i'm used to.\n\nApart from maintaining the museum, what do you work on ? You are still active in the department even though you are retired ? \nI work on sensors, in the internet of things world in one of the university spin-off. What i do for them is sensors wireless need power, and some of them are on batteries. They have designed a complete system which should makes the battery lasts for two, three, four years.

__NOPUBLISH__\n\n\n**You have been using computers since a long time, as you explained us during the tour we had the joy of assisting during the TGSO.**\n**I heard that that until recently, let's say the late 1990's, when learning computer programming you had to start by  writing down the program on paper... ** \n\nIn 1973, i did study computer sciences, it was the second year of the department, here in Leuven. At the time computers were mainframes and you did fed them with programms by punch cards. Programing was writing down the program, than you punched it and the next day you get results, mostly error. That's the way it worked at that time. To teach us programing, they used the langage of that time, Fortran and some kind of invented assembly langage, it didn't really exist, it was simplified.\n\nMost of the time you did write down your program, the teacher and the assistant would have to tell you what is wrong or good, you didn't had much practical experience.\n\n**How was it like, tons of pages ?** \n\nNo. As an anecdocte, i remember punchcards were a block of papers, we were jealous of the people who came in the computer center with huge stacks of cards. That were really small programs, not complicated one. The fact you had to learn to use the computer from scratch, everything was new, you couldn't rely on previous experiences, everything was new. And to start with small programs was difficult enough. \n\nThat was also the time when Edsger W. Dijkstra who forked the goto... i still remember him, in an audience, giving us a lecture on modernisation in programming at the International computing symposium 1977 in Liège (programming: from craft to scientific discipline https://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/EWD/transcriptions/EWD05xx/EWD566.html). He told usxx (i'll complete it as soon as possible. i need Jean's input)\"\n\nAnd then from 75 on, computers became cheaper and could be bought by departments and smaller entities. And than came the first interactive computer. Still beasts about two cubic meters, costing two millions belgian francs. But it was low enough to allow people to type in directly commands. I started working here in 75 as a researcher, it have evolved continuously and i saw computer getting cheaper and getting easier to use.The way to use it was simplified, you could start to go to the beast and try it out.\n\nI remember more or less: you did write down the program in Fortran for instance… We always thought in the beginning that it would work and it didn't, so after a turn around you were giving it back to the operator and you have to wait half a day or a night to get the results.\n\n**What kind of program you were working on?** \n\nI remember the first program i had to write was you got three numbers, you had to make the program decide if you construct a triangle with the numbers being the sides of the triangle.\n\n**That took an afternoon to be processed ?** \n\nWell, yeah. You had to imagine how to do it which was also one problem, than you prepare the card with the punching machine and you give the package of cards to the operator who was feeeding the computer with the cards. People had the taks to fed the computers by hands, with paper, cards, than disks and it lasts onto the magnetic disks period. And after a number of hours or a night you get a listing, a piece of paper, with the results.\n\n**When where you able to record the program onto the machine?**\n\nI think that happens between 75 and 80. After the punching cards which was already a way to record the program, we had  typewriters, terminals but we could record the programs, we could store them on the computer. We had magnetic discs. IBM had number for everything, i remember the 33-30 [manufactured from 1970 on] had a magnetic disk. We didn't touch the machines, operators would change the disks, we could only access the typewriter. That was our most direct connexion to the computer. Thetimes were diffent. The mainframes were such huge costly beasts that it had operators day and night keeping it busy. Even at night there were two or three guys mounting tapes, dismounting tapes, that kind of stuff.\nhttps://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/42/IBM_magnetic_disk_drives_3330%2B3333.png/600px-IBM_magnetic_disk_drives_3330%2B3333.png\n\n**When did you stop working with operators?** \n\nSomewhere between 85 and 90. There were still operators at the main computer of the university, but there were also small computers, so researchers and student can have direct access when needed. \n\n**When did you start to work with software sold by others or gived away in order to do your research?** \n\nYou stil need an operating system on the mainframe that was delivered by IBM or the constructor delivering the mainframe. When you bought mini-computers, which were the  smaller versions of mainframes, in most cases you did buy an operating systems, compilers and all the stuff you need to be able to program those things. In most cases, because the computer sciences department did buy the mini-computer from, for instance *digital equipment corporation*,  a manufactorer of that time, but they didn't buy their software. They were not open source or free,  but you could get Unix and could run it on those digital equipment (DEC) computers. That is what the computer department of the University of Louvain la Neuve *l'unité d'informatique*, did and so did we.\n\n**When did you start working with unix as an os?** \n\nI took a trip to Amsterdam, it must have been in 1979/80… Well, the story starts in our french sister university (LLN) where they did have a PDP-11 with Unix on it https://hackadaycom.files.wordpress.com/2016/08/full-size-pdp11.jpg. You got Unix, at the time, when you were a university, from Bell Aps (Ma Bell), the american telephone company. It was a mega organisation at the time [before the [dismantlment of AT&T/Bell system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breakup_of_the_Bell_System)].Due to monopoly, the US authorities splitted up in different Baby Bells. One of the restriction was there was a research baby bell, they couldn't really sell anything.There were computer scientists there, who did developped some Unix interesting things.  For universities you did get the source and no support for free. How to install it, no idea. In Unité d'informatique, they were lucky: they got the same computer that unix were developped on.  They got the disk by snail mail as a post-office package. They mounted it and it did spin up and they had it.\nHere, we did have a cheaper PDP11 (DEC - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PDP-11) We go the disk source from Bell Aps but we could not run it. We could look at it but that was all, because our disc format was different than the one at Bell Aps. Somebody here did write a driver for that disk and we did compiled it in l'unité d'informatique of LLN.  it did compile it but we couldn't try it because we did not have So we find the nearest Unix system compatiblewith ours, it was in Amsterdam.  Andrew Tenebaum who did write since then a number of books about operating systems and became quite an authority. He was working there. It was the young Tanenbaum, just arriving from United States to Amsterdam. He was learning to speak dutch. We did understood his english better but his assistant insisted that he speaks dutch because he will have to pass an exam in dutch. There we got a disk, than also the one with the driver we compiled, than we got here and we start using Unix.  Than in my opinion the start of open source was Unix because we had to maintain it by ourselves and we learned a lot from the sources.\nIn that time we did had to get software and it brings us to different places. For example, at the time the agents at the custom at the airport or post didn't know what to do with the discs in terms of custom clearance. They used magnetic or xrays, we had to write on the package that it should not be x-rayed. But we got time to time unreadable discs. \n\n**So it took like weeks between the transportation, the custom...**\nYes, the custom had to clear the packages. I remember i've been in the customs in Zaventem. I had received a letter that my package from Bell Aps had arrived. I went there thinking i would have to pay something and go. But no. It had to be cleared so there wa some organisation that had to do administrative stuff, so i only got it a few days later. The response time was huge :)\n\n**Than after that period of time how did you switch from that kind of collaboration on how to make software and make software work to collaboration on networks, between universities and researchers...**\nIn the Unix system of that time there was a kind of networking protocol which only did work on serial lines.\n You could connect two unix systems together you only need a line. We had one between LLN and Leuven, it's only 15 kms, but we had to ask Belgacom, than La Régie des télégraphes et téléphones, to get a modem to connect through their network and than over that modem you could reach an amazing speed of 300 characters per second. And that was the first communication. It did happened somewhere around 85. And then you had connexion with another computer, writing something here and do  something. And we could send programs to each other. \n \n **What was the first thing you did send through a network like this?**\n I didn't do it myself, i remember it was a kind of chat program. And on LLN side was Elie Milgrom, he is retired now. On this side, it was Pr Willems. And i remember that they typed something and they got a response from the other side and that was it.  But i remember that Pr Willems sent \"ok we stop now\". And that Elie Milgrom answered \"See you later, Alligator\" [a reference to Bill Haley and the Comets].  At the time we still had these kind of songs in mind. (lol). Those Unix to Unix connexions were first. And there was a worldwide Unix to Unix based network, Usenet (1979), it still exists somewhere... you can download load  of illegal movies and that stuff, that was not what we meant at the time. But that is what is left. And Usenet became gradually replaced by the Internet in USA. In Europe, the Internet came a lot later, but we had access to the Internet, we could send mail to them and we could receive mail from them, because some friendly american university, later companies, did translate internet mail to UCP mail. That was before the 1990's.\n \n **Your relation to software had changed at the time because you did not have to do all this manipulations with the software your received... Was it already floppy discs ?**\n No, magnetic tapes, for the mainframe at least. Most of the mini-computers had some cheaper magnetic tapes. Between 90 and 95 the main machines for the software institute was a VAX from DEC. Once a year the software came from Berkeley, it was still Unix but modified by Berkeley for virtual memory and all the stuff which are common now. We received a tape, with lot of goodies, i still remember we didn't know what was on there but we scrutinised there to know what was there, what we can use.\nIn Europe, companies like Siemens were trying to set up software centers to make software avaiable, they were even trying to set up networks. Researchers did love the Internet, it worked, it was useful for their researchs. So companies in Europe, were trying to set up their own networks, i remember for example the X/OPEN transport protocol. Their was a lot of standards about what software layers should do, but it didn't succeed because sometime, 92 maybe, IBM decided to quit their own private network and to go forTCP/IP and was the switching point. Everything done for X/OPEN were suddently forgotten. For the mainframes, and certainly in Belgium computing was mainly mainframes, i'm talking about universities here, so when IBM decided to go for TCP/IP we followed even though things were really slow. For example, Belgacom was not interested in running the Domain Name System so we did it here, for some time, starting in 1993 with Pierre Verbaten (https://www.dnsbelgium.be/en/history). Belgacom were focused on X25 (DCS - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X.25) so they missed it.\n\nIt was like the french Minitel ? \nWell, at that time we were really jealous about Minitel. Could you imagine that? Terminals?  At home ? You could work home with a computer ! You could send emails ! All in one, a pc computer with a modem ! \n\nHow did the research about software evolved in the department?\nI am mainly talking about network research but here there were people working on numerical analysis, computing, artificial intelligence ... I was just not involved in those research so i don't know much about it \n\nYou were focused on software and network..\nYes, we did produce some software. We did make software to generate compilers, there was some A.I. software in Prolog, numerical analysis  libraries... Some were sold or shared, it depends.  \nWe did sell some software since the beginning i think when it was not even a department but a professor and a couple of students.\n\nIs it when you joined ? \nNo it was already a department. I did study dutch industrial engeneering in electronics. At the time in electronics you did hear something about computers, i was interested in it i wanted to know more. I heard they had started a year before a degree in computer engeneering. It was the first year where industrial engineer could join. The only thing we knew about computer were in movies. I wanted to know how it work. I'm not sure i still know now even if maybe i have some ideas...\n\nHow many langage do you know ?\nAssembly, FORTRAN, PL-1 the langage invented by IBM to be the universal one, C, Cobol. Perl, i don't know, so more. I'm not fluent in any other langages, but i can read any langage especially well writtened, i know i can understand it and learn it...I know JAVA also. As a system administrator the thing i use most are the command line of UNIX and Perl. But that's because i'm more familiar with those two so it goes faster.\n\nHow did you see the rise of personnal computer and the software that goes with ? \nI have to admit that we missed it. We didn't see that what was new was powerful. We were not impressed by the software. I remember windows 95, the news on TV, people sleeping on the street to get it. I remember when i get my first windows version, with a box of 22 floppies or so. Then i wanted to do something, to compile a program, but there was no compiler. We were used to Unix, a basic system but with a lot of utilities in it. Software was for us free, and we were used to have it free and it was not free anymore. \n\nDoes that mean you didn't had a personnal computer until late ? \nYes. I think it was round 2000. I didn't needed it really. I got one when the belgian UCP network became commercial. Of course i did not get Windows on it.  I think we got Linux here in 1994. There was a guy involved in the kernel studying here. So we did used it very fast.\n\nSo, what is software for you ?\nFor me software is the magic that make computer usable. I can only gives examples of what i mean by it. A PC without software most people, even computer scientists, can't do anything with it. You need basic software. Some software are already integrated in the computer hardware. Same for phones, tablets... The main characteristic, for me, is that it should be user friendly. That is very difficult i know, because you have to imagine what the people using your software are going to do with it and how they want to use it, that's the magic you need to solve.\n\nIs command line user friendly ? \nWell, somehow you have to learn the command langage that is in fact a computer langage where you can make all the constructs that other langages offers.\nYou can create loops, you can test, whatever. It's not so different from computer langages like C or JAVA or whatever. \n\nBut it's already software no ? User friendly depends on what you put behind these words, no ? \nYes it's already software. I don't have a strong opinion about command lines. It depends on people. I can imagine that someone that have never heard about the command line expect that you click somewhere and it happens. But if you know the command langage it's sometimes perhaps easier or productive to type commands and let it run. Sometimes, i find it easier if i have a screen and a number of buttons and i don't have to imagine what happens behind that screen. And sometimes i want to do something with the command line, because i'm used to it. That's why i don't trust myself about user friendliness because i have a long experience in computer interfaces. I'm so used to some of them perhaps i can't even imagine that somebody else would like to do it otherwise or doesn't like what i'm used to.\n\nApart from maintaining the museum, what do you work on ? You are still active in the department even though you are retired ? \nI work on sensors, in the internet of things world in one of the university spin-off. What i do for them is sensors wireless need power, and some of them are on batteries. They have designed a complete system which should makes the battery lasts for two, three, four years. They need a system to measure that. So i'm working on a mechanism to measure that without waiting four years. That's programming instrumentation computers that's part Unix systems. There is enough new or unknown things and

the late 1990's, when learning computer programming you had to start by  writing down the program on paper... ** \n\nIn 1973, i did study computer sciences, it was the second year of the department, here in Leuven.

That's the way it worked at that time. To teach us programing, they used the langage of that time, Fortran and some kind of invented assembly langage, it didn't really exist, it was simplified.\n\nMost of the time you did write down your program, the teacher and the assistant would have to tell you what is wrong or good, you didn't had much practical experience.\n\n**How was it like, tons of pages ?** \n\nNo. As an anecdocte, i remember punchcards were a block of papers, we were jealous of the people who came in the computer center with huge stacks of cards. That were really small programs, not complicated one. The fact you had to learn to use the computer from scratch, everything was new, you couldn't rely on previous experiences, everything was new.

You had to imagine how to do it which was also one problem, than you prepare the card with the punching machine and you give the package of cards to the operator who was feeeding the computer with the cards. People had the taks to fed the computers by hands, with paper, cards, than disks and it lasts onto the magnetic disks period. And after a number of hours or a night you get a listing, a piece of paper, with the results.\n\n**When where you able to record the program onto the machine?**\n\nI think that happens between 75 and 80. After the punching cards which was already a way to record the program, we had  typewriters, terminals but we could record the programs, we could store them on the computer. We had magnetic discs. IBM had number for everything, i remember the 33-30 [manufactured from 1970 on] had a magnetic disk. We didn't touch the machines, operators would change the disks, we could only access the typewriter. That was our most direct connexion to the computer. Thetimes were diffent. The mainframes were such huge costly beasts that it had operators day and night keeping it busy. Even at night there were two or three guys mounting tapes, dismounting tapes, that kind of stuff.\nhttps://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/42/IBM_magnetic_disk_drives_3330%2B3333.png/600px-IBM_magnetic_disk_drives_3330%2B3333.png\n\n**When did you stop working with operators?** \n\nSomewhere between 85 and 90. There were still operators at the main computer of the university, but there were also small computers, so researchers and student can have direct access when needed. \n\n**When did you start to work with software sold by others or gived away in order to do your research?** \n\nYou stil need an operating system on the mainframe that was delivered by IBM or the constructor delivering the mainframe. When you bought mini-computers, which were the  smaller versions of mainframes, in most cases you did buy an operating systems, compilers and all the stuff you need to be able to program those things. In most cases, because the computer sciences department did buy the mini-computer from, for instance *digital equipment corporation*,  a manufactorer of that time, but they didn't buy their software. They were not open source or free,  but you could get Unix and could run it on those digital equipment (DEC) computers. That is what the computer department of the University of Louvain la Neuve *l'unité d'informatique*, did and so did we.\n\n**When did you start working with unix as an os?** \n\nI took a trip to Amsterdam, it must have been in 1979/80… Well, the story starts in our french sister university (LLN) where they did have a PDP-11 with Unix on it https://hackadaycom.files.wordpress.com/2016/08/full-size-pdp11.jpg. You got Unix, at the time, when you were a university, from Bell Aps (Ma Bell), the american telephone company.

You got Unix, at the time, when you were a university, from Bell Aps (Ma Bell), the american telephone company. It was a mega organisation at the time [before the [dismantlment of AT&T/Bell system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breakup_of_the_Bell_System)].Due to monopoly, the US authorities splitted up in different Baby Bells. One of the restriction was there was a research baby bell, they couldn't really sell anything.There were computer scientists there, who did developped some Unix interesting things.  For universities you did get the source and no support for free. How to install it, no idea. In Unité d'informatique, they were lucky: they got the same computer that unix were developped on.  They got the disk by snail mail as a post-office package. They mounted it and it did spin up and they had it.\nHere, we did have a cheaper PDP11 (DEC - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PDP-11) We go the disk source from Bell Aps but we could not run it. We could look at it but that was all, because our disc format was different than the one at Bell Aps. Somebody here did write a driver for that disk and we did compiled it in l'unité d'informatique of LLN.  it did compile it but we couldn't try it because we did not have So we find the nearest Unix system compatiblewith ours, it was in Amsterdam.  Andrew Tenebaum who did write since then a number of books about operating systems and became quite an authority. He was working there. It was the young Tanenbaum, just arriving from United States to Amsterdam. He was learning to speak dutch. We did understood his english better but his assistant insisted that he speaks dutch because he will have to pass an exam in dutch. There we got a disk, than also the one with the driver we compiled, than we got here and we start using Unix.  Than in my opinion the start of open source was Unix because we had to maintain it by ourselves and we learned a lot from the sources.\nIn that time we did had to get software and it brings us to different places. For example, at the time the agents at the custom at the airport or post didn't know what to do with the discs in terms of custom clearance. They used magnetic or xrays, we had to write on the package that it should not be x-rayed. But we got time to time unreadable discs. \n\n**So it took like weeks between the transportation, the custom...**\nYes, the custom had to clear the packages. I remember i've been in the customs in Zaventem. I had received a letter that my package from Bell Aps had arrived. I went there thinking i would have to pay something and go. But no. It had to be cleared so there wa some organisation that had to do administrative stuff, so i only got it a few days later. The response time was huge :)\n\n**Than after that period of time how did you switch from that kind of collaboration on how to make software and make software work to collaboration on networks, between universities and researchers...**\nIn the Unix system of that time there was a kind of networking protocol which only did work on serial lines.\n You could connect two unix systems together you only need a line. We had one between LLN and Leuven, it's only 15 kms, but we had to ask Belgacom, than La Régie des télégraphes et téléphones, to get a modem to connect through their network and than over that modem you could reach an amazing speed of 300 characters per second. And that was the first communication. It did happened somewhere around 85. And then you had connexion with another computer, writing something here and do  something. And we could send programs to each other. \n \n **What was the first thing you did send through a network like this?**\n I didn't do it myself, i remember it was a kind of chat program. And on LLN side was Elie Milgrom, he is retired now. On this side, it was Pr Willems. And i remember that they typed something and they got a response from the other side and that was it.  But i remember that Pr Willems sent \"ok we stop now\". And that Elie Milgrom answered \"See you later, Alligator\" [a reference to Bill Haley and the Comets].  At the time we still had these kind of songs in mind. (lol). Those Unix to Unix connexions were first. And there was a worldwide Unix to Unix based network, Usenet (1979), it still exists somewhere... you can download load  of illegal movies and that stuff, that was not what we meant at the time. But that is what is left. And Usenet became gradually replaced by the Internet in USA. In Europe, the Internet came a lot later, but we had access to the Internet, we could send mail to them and we could receive mail from them, because some friendly american university, later companies, did translate internet mail to UCP mail. That was before the 1990's.\n \n **Your relation to software had changed at the time because you did not have to do all this manipulations with the software your received... Was it already floppy discs ?**\n No, magnetic tapes, for the mainframe at least. Most of the mini-computers had some cheaper magnetic tapes. Between 90 and 95 the main machines for the software institute was a VAX from DEC. Once a year the software came from Berkeley, it was still Unix but modified by Berkeley for virtual memory and all the stuff which are common now. We received a tape, with lot of goodies, i still remember we didn't know what was on there but we scrutinised there to know what was there, what we can use.\nIn Europe, companies like Siemens were trying to set up software centers to make software avaiable, they were even trying to set up networks. Researchers did love the Internet, it worked, it was useful for their researchs. So companies in Europe, were trying to set up their own networks, i remember for example the X/OPEN transport protocol. Their was a lot of standards about what software layers should do, but it didn't succeed because sometime, 92 maybe, IBM decided to quit their own private network and to go forTCP/IP and was the switching point. Everything done for X/OPEN were suddently forgotten. For the mainframes, and certainly in Belgium computing was mainly mainframes, i'm talking about universities here, so when IBM decided to go for TCP/IP we followed even though things were really slow. For example, Belgacom was not interested in running the Domain Name System so we did it here, for some time, starting in 1993 with Pierre Verbaten (https://www.dnsbelgium.be/en/history). Belgacom were focused on X25 (DCS - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X.25) so they missed it.\n\nIt was like the french Minitel ? \nWell, at that time we were really jealous about Minitel. Could you imagine that? Terminals?  At home ? You could work home with a computer ! You could send emails ! All in one, a pc computer with a modem ! \n\nHow did the research about software evolved in the department?\nI am mainly talking about network research but here there were people working on numerical analysis, computing, artificial intelligence ... I was just not involved in those research so i don't know much about it \n\nYou were focused on software and network..\nYes, we did produce some software. We did make software to generate compilers, there was some A.I. software in Prolog, numerical analysis  libraries... Some were sold or shared, it depends.  \nWe did sell some software since the beginning i think when it was not even a department but a professor and a couple of students.\n\nIs it when you joined ? \nNo it was already a department. I did study dutch industrial engeneering in electronics. At the time in electronics you did hear something about computers, i was interested in it i wanted to know more. I heard they had started a year before a degree in computer engeneering. It was the first year where industrial engineer could join. The only thing we knew about computer were in movies. I wanted to know how it work. I'm not sure i still know now even if maybe i have some ideas...\n\nHow many langage do you know ?\nAssembly, FORTRAN, PL-1 the langage invented by IBM to be the universal one, C, Cobol. Perl, i don't know, so more. I'm not fluent in any other langages, but i can read any langage especially well writtened, i know i can understand it and learn it...I know JAVA also. As a system administrator the thing i use most are the command line of UNIX and Perl. But that's because i'm more familiar with those two so it goes faster.\n\nHow did you see the rise of personnal computer and the software that goes with ? \nI have to admit that we missed it. We didn't see that what was new was powerful. We were not impressed by the software. I remember windows 95, the news on TV, people sleeping on the street to get it. I remember when i get my first windows version, with a box of 22 floppies or so. Then i wanted to do something, to compile a program, but there was no compiler. We were used to Unix, a basic system but with a lot of utilities in it. Software was for us free, and we were used to have it free and it was not free anymore. \n\nDoes that mean you didn't had a personnal computer until late ? \nYes. I think it was round 2000. I didn't needed it really. I got one when the belgian UCP network became commercial. Of course i did not get Windows on it.  I think we got Linux here in 1994. There was a guy involved in the kernel studying here. So we did used it very fast.\n\nSo, what is software for you ?\nFor me software is the magic that make computer usable. I can only gives examples of what i mean by it. A PC without software most people, even computer scientists, can't do anything with it. You need basic software. Some software are already integrated in the computer hardware. Same for phones, tablets... The main characteristic, for me, is that it should be user friendly. That is very difficult i know, because you have to imagine what the people using your software are going to do with it and how they want to use it, that's the magic you need to solve.\n\nIs command line user friendly ? \nWell, somehow you have to learn the command langage that is in fact a computer langage where you can make all the constructs that other langages offers.\nYou can create loops, you can test, whatever. It's not so different from computer langages like C or JAVA or whatever. \n\nBut it's already software no ? User friendly depends on what you put behind these words, no ? \nYes it's already software. I don't have a strong opinion about command lines. It depends on people. I can imagine that someone that have never heard about the command line expect that you click somewhere and it happens. But if you know the command langage it's sometimes perhaps easier or productive to type commands and let it run. Sometimes, i find it easier if i have a screen and a number of buttons and i don't have to imagine what happens behind that screen. And sometimes i want to do something with the command line, because i'm used to it. That's why i don't trust myself about user friendliness because i have a long experience in computer interfaces. I'm so used to some of them perhaps i can't even imagine that somebody else would like to do it otherwise or doesn't like what i'm used to.\n\nApart from maintaining the museum, what do you work on ? You are still active in the department even though you are retired ? \nI work on sensors, in the internet of things world in one of the university spin-off. What i do for them is sensors wireless need power, and some of them are on batteries. They have designed a complete system which should makes the battery lasts for two, three, four years. They need a system to measure that. So i been working on a mechanism to measure that without waiting four years. That's programming instrumentation computers to mesure power or whatever, that's part Unix systems. Thereare enough new or unknown things and maybe because i'm older i have another way of looking at things so we have a lot of discussions on how to do things.

__NOPUBLISH__\n\n\n**You have been using computers since a long time, as you explained us during the tour we had the joy of assisting during the TGSO.**\n**I heard that that until recently, let's say the late 1990's, when learning computer programming you had to start by  writing down the program on paper... ** \n\nIn 1973, i did study computer sciences, it was the second year of the department, here in Leuven. At the time computers were mainframes and you did fed them with programms by punch cards. Programing was writing down the program, than you punched it and the next day you get results, mostly error. That's the way it worked at that time. To teach us programing, they used the langage of that time, Fortran and some kind of invented assembly langage, it didn't really exist, it was simplified.\n\nMost of the time you did write down your program, the teacher and the assistant would have to tell you what is wrong or good, you didn't had much practical experience.\n\n**How was it like, tons of pages ?** \n\nNo. As an anecdocte, i remember punchcards were a block of papers, we were jealous of the people who came in the computer center with huge stacks of cards. That were really small programs, not complicated one. The fact you had to learn to use the computer from scratch, everything was new, you couldn't rely on previous experiences, everything was new. And to start with small programs was difficult enough. \n\nThat was also the time when Edsger W. Dijkstra who forked the goto... i still remember him, in an audience, giving us a lecture on modernisation in programming at the International computing symposium 1977 in Liège (programming: from craft to scientific discipline https://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/EWD/transcriptions/EWD05xx/EWD566.html). He told usxx (i'll complete it as soon as possible. i need Jean's input)\"\n\nAnd then from 75 on, computers became cheaper and could be bought by departments and smaller entities. And than came the first interactive computer. Still beasts about two cubic meters, costing two millions belgian francs. But it was low enough to allow people to type in directly commands. I started working here in 75 as a researcher, it have evolved continuously and i saw computer getting cheaper and getting easier to use.The way to use it was simplified, you could start to go to the beast and try it out.\n\nI remember more or less: you did write down the program in Fortran for instance… We always thought in the beginning that it would work and it didn't, so after a turn around you were giving it back to the operator and you have to wait half a day or a night to get the results.\n\n**What kind of program you were working on?** \n\nI remember the first program i had to write was you got three numbers, you had to make the program decide if you construct a triangle with the numbers being the sides of the triangle.\n\n**That took an afternoon to be processed ?** \n\nWell, yeah. You had to imagine how to do it which was also one problem, than you prepare the card with the punching machine and you give the package of cards to the operator who was feeeding the computer with the cards. People had the taks to fed the computers by hands, with paper, cards, than disks and it lasts onto the magnetic disks period. And after a number of hours or a night you get a listing, a piece of paper, with the results.\n\n**When where you able to record the program onto the machine?**\n\nI think that happens between 75 and 80. After the punching cards which was already a way to record the program, we had  typewriters, terminals but we could record the programs, we could store them on the computer. We had magnetic discs. IBM had number for everything, i remember the 33-30 [manufactured from 1970 on] had a magnetic disk. We didn't touch the machines, operators would change the disks, we could only access the typewriter. That was our most direct connexion to the computer. Thetimes were diffent. The mainframes were such huge costly beasts that it had operators day and night keeping it busy. Even at night there were two or three guys mounting tapes, dismounting tapes, that kind of stuff.\nhttps://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/42/IBM_magnetic_disk_drives_3330%2B3333.png/600px-IBM_magnetic_disk_drives_3330%2B3333.png\n\n**When did you stop working with operators?** \n\nSomewhere between 85 and 90. There were still operators at the main computer of the university, but there were also small computers, so researchers and student can have direct access when needed. \n\n**When did you start to work with software sold by others or gived away in order to do your research?** \n\nYou stil need an operating system on the mainframe that was delivered by IBM or the constructor delivering the mainframe. When you bought mini-computers, which were the  smaller versions of mainframes, in most cases you did buy an operating systems, compilers and all the stuff you need to be able to program those things. In most cases, because the computer sciences department did buy the mini-computer from, for instance *digital equipment corporation*,  a manufactorer of that time, but they didn't buy their software. They were not open source or free,  but you could get Unix and could run it on those digital equipment (DEC) computers. That is what the computer department of the University of Louvain la Neuve *l'unité d'informatique*, did and so did we.\n\n**When did you start working with unix as an os?** \n\nI took a trip to Amsterdam, it must have been in 1979/80… Well, the story starts in our french sister university (LLN) where they did have a PDP-11 with Unix on it https://hackadaycom.files.wordpress.com/2016/08/full-size-pdp11.jpg. You got Unix, at the time, when you were a university, from Bell Aps (Ma Bell), the american telephone company. It was a mega organisation at the time [before the [dismantlment of AT&T/Bell system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breakup_of_the_Bell_System)].Due to monopoly, the US authorities splitted up in different Baby Bells. One of the restriction was there was a research baby bell, they couldn't really sell anything.There were computer scientists there, who did developped some Unix interesting things.  For universities you did get the source and no support for free. How to install it, no idea. In Unité d'informatique, they were lucky: they got the same computer that unix were developped on.  They got the disk by snail mail as a post-office package. They mounted it and it did spin up and they had it.\nHere, we did have a cheaper PDP11 (DEC - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PDP-11) We go the disk source from Bell Aps but we could not run it. We could look at it but that was all, because our disc format was different than the one at Bell Aps. Somebody here did write a driver for that disk and we did compiled it in l'unité d'informatique of LLN.  it did compile it but we couldn't try it because we did not have So we find the nearest Unix system compatiblewith ours, it was in Amsterdam.  Andrew Tenebaum who did write since then a number of books about operating systems and became quite an authority. He was working there. It was the young Tanenbaum, just arriving from United States to Amsterdam. He was learning to speak dutch. We did understood his english better but his assistant insisted that he speaks dutch because he will have to pass an exam in dutch. There we got a disk, than also the one with the driver we compiled, than we got here and we start using Unix.  Than in my opinion the start of open source was Unix because we had to maintain it by ourselves and we learned a lot from the sources.\nIn that time we did had to get software and it brings us to different places. For example, at the time the agents at the custom at the airport or post didn't know what to do with the discs in terms of custom clearance. They used magnetic or xrays, we had to write on the package that it should not be x-rayed. But we got time to time unreadable discs. \n\n**So it took like weeks between the transportation, the custom...**\nYes, the custom had to clear the packages. I remember i've been in the customs in Zaventem. I had received a letter that my package from Bell Aps had arrived. I went there thinking i would have to pay something and go. But no. It had to be cleared so there wa some organisation that had to do administrative stuff, so i only got it a few days later. The response time was huge :)\n\n**Than after that period of time how did you switch from that kind of collaboration on how to make software and make software work to collaboration on networks, between universities and researchers...**\nIn the Unix system of that time there was a kind of networking protocol which only did work on serial lines.\n You could connect two unix systems together you only need a line. We had one between LLN and Leuven, it's only 15 kms, but we had to ask Belgacom, than La Régie des télégraphes et téléphones, to get a modem to connect through their network and than over that modem you could reach an amazing speed of 300 characters per second. And that was the first communication. It did happened somewhere around 85. And then you had connexion with another computer, writing something here and do  something. And we could send programs to each other. \n \n **What was the first thing you did send through a network like this?**\n I didn't do it myself, i remember it was a kind of chat program. And on LLN side was Elie Milgrom, he is retired now. On this side, it was Pr Willems. And i remember that they typed something and they got a response from the other side and that was it.  But i remember that Pr Willems sent \"ok we stop now\". And that Elie Milgrom answered \"See you later, Alligator\" [a reference to Bill Haley and the Comets].  At the time we still had these kind of songs in mind. (lol). Those Unix to Unix connexions were first. And there was a worldwide Unix to Unix based network, Usenet (1979), it still exists somewhere... you can download load  of illegal movies and that stuff, that was not what we meant at the time. But that is what is left. And Usenet became gradually replaced by the Internet in USA. In Europe, the Internet came a lot later, but we had access to the Internet, we could send mail to them and we could receive mail from them, because some friendly american university, later companies, did translate internet mail to UCP mail. That was before the 1990's.\n \n **Your relation to software had changed at the time because you did not have to do all this manipulations with the software your received... Was it already floppy discs ?**\n No, magnetic tapes, for the mainframe at least. Most of the mini-computers had some cheaper magnetic tapes. Between 90 and 95 the main machines for the software institute was a VAX from DEC. Once a year the software came from Berkeley, it was still Unix but modified by Berkeley for virtual memory and all the stuff which are common now. We received a tape, with lot of goodies, i still remember we didn't know what was on there but we scrutinised there to know what was there, what we can use.\nIn Europe, companies like Siemens were trying to set up software centers to make software avaiable, they were even trying to set up networks. Researchers did love the Internet, it worked, it was useful for their researchs. So companies in Europe, were trying to set up their own networks, i remember for example the X/OPEN transport protocol. Their was a lot of standards about what software layers should do, but it didn't succeed because sometime, 92 maybe, IBM decided to quit their own private network and to go forTCP/IP and was the switching point. Everything done for X/OPEN were suddently forgotten. For the mainframes, and certainly in Belgium computing was mainly mainframes, i'm talking about universities here, so when IBM decided to go for TCP/IP we followed even though things were really slow. For example, Belgacom was not interested in running the Domain Name System so we did it here, for some time, starting in 1993 with Pierre Verbaten (https://www.dnsbelgium.be/en/history). Belgacom were focused on X25 (DCS - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X.25) so they missed it.\n\nIt was like the french Minitel ? \nWell, at that time we were really jealous about Minitel. Could you imagine that? Terminals?  At home ? You could work home with a computer ! You could send emails ! All in one, a pc computer with a modem ! \n\nHow did the research about software evolved in the department?\nI am mainly talking about network research but here there were people working on numerical analysis, computing, artificial intelligence ... I was just not involved in those research so i don't know much about it \n\nYou were focused on software and network..\nYes, we did produce some software. We did make software to generate compilers, there was some A.I. software in Prolog, numerical analysis  libraries... Some were sold or shared, it depends.  \nWe did sell some software since the beginning i think when it was not even a department but a professor and a couple of students.\n\nIs it when you joined ? \nNo it was already a department. I did study dutch industrial engeneering in electronics. At the time in electronics you did hear something about computers, i was interested in it i wanted to know more. I heard they had started a year before a degree in computer engeneering. It was the first year where industrial engineer could join. The only thing we knew about computer were in movies. I wanted to know how it work. I'm not sure i still know now even if maybe i have some ideas...\n\nHow many langage do you know ?\nAssembly, FORTRAN, PL-1 the langage invented by IBM to be the universal one, C, Cobol. Perl, i don't know, so more. I'm not fluent in any other langages, but i can read any langage especially well writtened, i know i can understand it and learn it...I know JAVA also. As a system administrator the thing i use most are the command line of UNIX and Perl. But that's because i'm more familiar with those two so it goes faster.\n\nHow did you see the rise of personnal computer and the software that goes with ? \nI have to admit that we missed it. We didn't see that what was new was powerful. We were not impressed by the software. I remember windows 95, the news on TV, people sleeping on the street to get it. I remember when i get my first windows version, with a box of 22 floppies or so. Then i wanted to do something, to compile a program, but there was no compiler. We were used to Unix, a basic system but with a lot of utilities in it. Software was for us free, and we were used to have it free and it was not free anymore. \n\nDoes that mean you didn't had a personnal computer until late ? \nYes. I think it was round 2000. I didn't needed it really. I got one when the belgian UCP network became commercial. Of course i did not get Windows on it.  I think we got Linux here in 1994. There was a guy involved in the kernel studying here. So we did used it very fast.\n\nSo, what is software for you ?\nFor me software is the magic that make computer usable. I can only gives examples of what i mean by it. A PC without software most people, even computer scientists, can't do anything with it. You need basic software. Some software are already integrated in the computer hardware. Same for phones, tablets... The main characteristic, for me, is that it should be user friendly. That is very difficult i know, because you have to imagine what the people using your software are going to do with it and how they want to use it, that's the magic you need to solve.\n\nIs command line user friendly ? \nWell, somehow you have to learn the command langage that is in fact a computer langage where you can make all the constructs that other langages offers.\nYou can create loops, you can test, whatever. It's not so different from computer langages like C or JAVA or whatever. \n\nBut it's already software no ? User friendly depends on what you put behind these words, no ? \nYes it's already software. I don't have a strong opinion about command lines. It depends on people. I can imagine that someone that have never heard about the command line expect that you click somewhere and it happens. But if you know the command langage it's sometimes perhaps easier or productive to type commands and let it run. Sometimes, i find it easier if i have a screen and a number of buttons and i don't have to imagine what happens behind that screen. And sometimes i want to do something with the command line, because i'm used to it. That's why i don't trust myself about user friendliness because i have a long experience in computer interfaces. I'm so used to some of them perhaps i can't even imagine that somebody else would like to do it otherwise or doesn't like what i'm used to.\n\nApart from maintaining the museum, what do you work on ? You are still active in the department even though you are retired ? \nI work on sensors, in the internet of things world in one of the university spin-off. What i do for them is sensors wireless need power, and some of them are on batteries. They have designed a complete system which should makes the battery lasts for two, three, four years. They need a system to measure that. So i been working on a mechanism to measure that without waiting four years. That's programming instrumentation computers to mesure power or whatever, that's part Unix systems. There are enough new or unknown things and maybe because i'm older, i have another way of looking at things, so we have a lot of discussions. They don't like my Pearl, they use python, JAVA those things...Pearl, it has it's disavantage, but you could do a lot of thing, each character has a meaning. With Python, you need all those libraries...It'\n\n\n\n","attribs":"|1+g*6|2+2*5+3p*6|1+1*5+4f*6|2+2+dm*6|2+2+4n*6|1+1|1+1*5+11*6|2+2+bc*6|2+2+5z*2+3e*3+1*4*3+20*4+1*6|2+2+e7*6|2+2+7n*6|2+2*5+1a*6|2+2+53*6|2+2*5+19*6|2+2+c7*6|2+2*5+1r*6|2+2+jo*6|1+1+41*6|2+2*5+1a*6|2+2+5g*6|2+2*5+2w*6|2+2+l6*6|2+2*5+1f*6|2+2+8f*5+7+kh*6|1+1+uu*0|1+1+9s*0|2+2*5+1v*0|1+1+aj*0|2+2*5+5m*0|1+1+30*0|1+1+48*2+15+9l*0|1+1+1*0|1+1+1*5+1y*0|1+1+tm*0|1+1+1*0|1+1*5+4t*0|1+1+dr*0|1+1+u6*0|2+2*5+x*0|1+1+5q*0|2+2*5+1q*0|1+1+5w*0|2+2*5+16*0|1+1+5b*0|1+1+3l*0|2+2*5+o*0|1+1+df*0|2+2*5+u*0|1+1+bs*0|2+2*5+29*0|1+1+eh*0|2+2*5+1s*0|1+1+7m*0|2+2*5+u*0|1+1+fk*0|2+2*5+w*0|1+1+48*0|1+1+3b*0|2+2*5+2m*0|1+1+m9*0|2+2*5+3i*0|1+1+8q*0+5+34*0+t+q*0+9o*6|3+3|1+1"}}},"pad:observatory.guide.jeanhuensitvextended:revs:7101":{"changeset":"Z:do0>3|2m=d0q=n6*0+3$s

the joy of assisting during the TGSO.**\n**I heard that that until recently, let's say the late 1990's, when learning computer programming you had to start by  writing down the program on paper... ** \n\nIn 1973, i did study computer sciences, it was the second year of the department, here in Leuven. At the time computers were mainframes and you did fed them with programms by punch cards. Programing was writing down the program, than you punched it and the next day you get results, mostly error. That's the way it worked at that time. To teach us programing, they used the langage of that time, Fortran and some kind of invented assembly langage, it didn't really exist, it was simplified.\n\nMost of the time you did write down your program, the teacher and the assistant would have to tell you what is wrong or good, you didn't had much practical experience.\n\n**How was it like, tons of pages ?** \n\nNo. As an anecdocte, i remember punchcards were a block of papers, we were jealous of the people who came in the computer center with huge stacks of cards. That were really small programs, not complicated one. The fact you had to learn to use the computer from scratch, everything was new, you couldn't rely on previous experiences, everything was new. And to start with small programs was difficult enough. \n\nThat was also the time when Edsger W. Dijkstra who forked the goto... i still remember him, in an audience, giving us a lecture on modernisation in programming at the International computing symposium 1977 in Liège (programming: from craft to scientific discipline https://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/EWD/transcriptions/EWD05xx/EWD566.html). He told usxx (i'll complete it as soon as possible. i need Jean's input)\"\n\nAnd then from 75 on, computers became cheaper and could be bought by departments and smaller entities. And than came the first interactive computer. Still beasts about two cubic meters, costing two millions belgian francs. But it was low enough to allow people to type in directly commands. I started working here in 75 as a researcher, it have evolved continuously and i saw computer getting cheaper and getting easier to use.The way to use it was simplified, you could start to go to the beast and try it out.\n\nI remember more or less: you did write down the program in Fortran for instance… We always thought in the beginning that it would work and it didn't, so after a turn around you were giving it back to the operator and you have to wait half a day or a night to get the results.\n\n**What kind of program you were working on?** \n\nI remember the first program i had to write was you got three numbers, you had to make the program decide if you construct a triangle with the numbers being the sides of the triangle.\n\n**That took an afternoon to be processed ?** \n\nWell, yeah. You had to imagine how to do it which was also one problem, than you prepare the card with the punching machine and you give the package of cards to the operator who was feeeding the computer with the cards. People had the taks to fed the computers by hands, with paper, cards, than disks and it lasts onto the magnetic disks period. And after a number of hours or a night you get a listing, a piece of paper, with the results.\n\n**When where you able to record the program onto the machine?**\n\nI think that happens between 75 and 80. After the punching cards which was already a way to record the program, we had  typewriters, terminals but we could record the programs, we could store them on the computer. We had magnetic discs. IBM had number for everything, i remember the 33-30 [manufactured from 1970 on] had a magnetic disk. We didn't touch the machines, operators would change the disks, we could only access the typewriter. That was our most direct connexion to the computer. Thetimes were diffent. The mainframes were such huge costly beasts that it had operators day and night keeping it busy. Even at night there were two or three guys mounting tapes, dismounting tapes, that kind of stuff.\nhttps://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/42/IBM_magnetic_disk_drives_3330%2B3333.png/600px-IBM_magnetic_disk_drives_3330%2B3333.png\n\n**When did you stop working with operators?** \n\nSomewhere between 85 and 90. There were still operators at the main computer of the university, but there were also small computers, so researchers and student can have direct access when needed. \n\n**When did you start to work with software sold by others or gived away in order to do your research?** \n\nYou stil need an operating system on the mainframe that was delivered by IBM or the constructor delivering the mainframe. When you bought mini-computers, which were the  smaller versions of mainframes, in most cases you did buy an operating systems, compilers and all the stuff you need to be able to program those things. In most cases, because the computer sciences department did buy the mini-computer from, for instance *digital equipment corporation*,  a manufactorer of that time, but they didn't buy their software. They were not open source or free,  but you could get Unix and could run it on those digital equipment (DEC) computers. That is what the computer department of the University of Louvain la Neuve *l'unité d'informatique*, did and so did we.\n\n**When did you start working with unix as an os?** \n\nI took a trip to Amsterdam, it must have been in 1979/80… Well, the story starts in our french sister university (LLN) where they did have a PDP-11 with Unix on it https://hackadaycom.files.wordpress.com/2016/08/full-size-pdp11.jpg. You got Unix, at the time, when you were a university, from Bell Aps (Ma Bell), the american telephone company. It was a mega organisation at the time [before the [dismantlment of AT&T/Bell system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breakup_of_the_Bell_System)].Due to monopoly, the US authorities splitted up in different Baby Bells. One of the restriction was there was a research baby bell, they couldn't really sell anything.There were computer scientists there, who did developped some Unix interesting things.  For universities you did get the source and no support for free. How to install it, no idea. In Unité d'informatique, they were lucky: they got the same computer that unix were developped on.  They got the disk by snail mail as a post-office package. They mounted it and it did spin up and they had it.\nHere, we did have a cheaper PDP11 (DEC - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PDP-11) We go the disk source from Bell Aps but we could not run it. We could look at it but that was all, because our disc format was different than the one at Bell Aps. Somebody here did write a driver for that disk and we did compiled it in l'unité d'informatique of LLN.  it did compile it but we couldn't try it because we did not have So we find the nearest Unix system compatiblewith ours, it was in Amsterdam.  Andrew Tenebaum who did write since then a number of books about operating systems and became quite an authority. He was working there. It was the young Tanenbaum, just arriving from United States to Amsterdam. He was learning to speak dutch. We did understood his english better but his assistant insisted that he speaks dutch because he will have to pass an exam in dutch. There we got a disk, than also the one with the driver we compiled, than we got here and we start using Unix.  Than in my opinion the start of open source was Unix because we had to maintain it by ourselves and we learned a lot from the sources.\nIn that time we did had to get software and it brings us to different places. For example, at the time the agents at the custom at the airport or post didn't know what to do with the discs in terms of custom clearance. They used magnetic or xrays, we had to write on the package that it should not be x-rayed. But we got time to time unreadable discs. \n\n**So it took like weeks between the transportation, the custom...**\nYes, the custom had to clear the packages. I remember i've been in the customs in Zaventem. I had received a letter that my package from Bell Aps had arrived. I went there thinking i would have to pay something and go. But no. It had to be cleared so there wa some organisation that had to do administrative stuff, so i only got it a few days later. The response time was huge :)\n\n**Than after that period of time how did you switch from that kind of collaboration on how to make software and make software work to collaboration on networks, between universities and researchers...**\nIn the Unix system of that time there was a kind of networking protocol which only did work on serial lines.\n You could connect two unix systems together you only need a line. We had one between LLN and Leuven, it's only 15 kms, but we had to ask Belgacom, than La Régie des télégraphes et téléphones, to get a modem to connect through their network and than over that modem you could reach an amazing speed of 300 characters per second. And that was the first communication. It did happened somewhere around 85. And then you had connexion with another computer, writing something here and do  something. And we could send programs to each other. \n \n **What was the first thing you did send through a network like this?**\n I didn't do it myself, i remember it was a kind of chat program. And on LLN side was Elie Milgrom, he is retired now. On this side, it was Pr Willems. And i remember that they typed something and they got a response from the other side and that was it.  But i remember that Pr Willems sent \"ok we stop now\". And that Elie Milgrom answered \"See you later, Alligator\" [a reference to Bill Haley and the Comets].  At the time we still had these kind of songs in mind. (lol). Those Unix to Unix connexions were first. And there was a worldwide Unix to Unix based network, Usenet (1979), it still exists somewhere... you can download load  of illegal movies and that stuff, that was not what we meant at the time. But that is what is left. And Usenet became gradually replaced by the Internet in USA. In Europe, the Internet came a lot later, but we had access to the Internet, we could send mail to them and we could receive mail from them, because some friendly american university, later companies, did translate internet mail to UCP mail. That was before the 1990's.\n \n **Your relation to software had changed at the time because you did not have to do all this manipulations with the software your received... Was it already floppy discs ?**\n No, magnetic tapes, for the mainframe at least. Most of the mini-computers had some cheaper magnetic tapes. Between 90 and 95 the main machines for the software institute was a VAX from DEC. Once a year the software came from Berkeley, it was still Unix but modified by Berkeley for virtual memory and all the stuff which are common now. We received a tape, with lot of goodies, i still remember we didn't know what was on there but we scrutinised there to know what was there, what we can use.\nIn Europe, companies like Siemens were trying to set up software centers to make software avaiable, they were even trying to set up networks. Researchers did love the Internet, it worked, it was useful for their researchs. So companies in Europe, were trying to set up their own networks, i remember for example the X/OPEN transport protocol. Their was a lot of standards about what software layers should do, but it didn't succeed because sometime, 92 maybe, IBM decided to quit their own private network and to go forTCP/IP and was the switching point. Everything done for X/OPEN were suddently forgotten. For the mainframes, and certainly in Belgium computing was mainly mainframes, i'm talking about universities here, so when IBM decided to go for TCP/IP we followed even though things were really slow. For example, Belgacom was not interested in running the Domain Name System so we did it here, for some time, starting in 1993 with Pierre Verbaten (https://www.dnsbelgium.be/en/history). Belgacom were focused on X25 (DCS - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X.25) so they missed it.\n\nIt was like the french Minitel ? \nWell, at that time we were really jealous about Minitel. Could you imagine that? Terminals?  At home ? You could work home with a computer ! You could send emails ! All in one, a pc computer with a modem ! \n\nHow did the research about software evolved in the department?\nI am mainly talking about network research but here there were people working on numerical analysis, computing, artificial intelligence ... I was just not involved in those research so i don't know much about it \n\nYou were focused on software and network..\nYes, we did produce some software. We did make software to generate compilers, there was some A.I. software in Prolog, numerical analysis  libraries... Some were sold or shared, it depends.  \nWe did sell some software since the beginning i think when it was not even a department but a professor and a couple of students.\n\nIs it when you joined ? \nNo it was already a department. I did study dutch industrial engeneering in electronics. At the time in electronics you did hear something about computers, i was interested in it i wanted to know more. I heard they had started a year before a degree in computer engeneering. It was the first year where industrial engineer could join. The only thing we knew about computer were in movies. I wanted to know how it work. I'm not sure i still know now even if maybe i have some ideas...\n\nHow many langage do you know ?\nAssembly, FORTRAN, PL-1 the langage invented by IBM to be the universal one, C, Cobol. Perl, i don't know, so more. I'm not fluent in any other langages, but i can read any langage especially well writtened, i know i can understand it and learn it...I know JAVA also. As a system administrator the thing i use most are the command line of UNIX and Perl. But that's because i'm more familiar with those two so it goes faster.\n\nHow did you see the rise of personnal computer and the software that goes with ? \nI have to admit that we missed it. We didn't see that what was new was powerful. We were not impressed by the software. I remember windows 95, the news on TV, people sleeping on the street to get it. I remember when i get my first windows version, with a box of 22 floppies or so. Then i wanted to do something, to compile a program, but there was no compiler. We were used to Unix, a basic system but with a lot of utilities in it. Software was for us free, and we were used to have it free and it was not free anymore. \n\nDoes that mean you didn't had a personnal computer until late ? \nYes. I think it was round 2000. I didn't needed it really. I got one when the belgian UCP network became commercial. Of course i did not get Windows on it.  I think we got Linux here in 1994. There was a guy involved in the kernel studying here. So we did used it very fast.\n\nSo, what is software for you ?\nFor me software is the magic that make computer usable. I can only gives examples of what i mean by it. A PC without software most people, even computer scientists, can't do anything with it. You need basic software. Some software are already integrated in the computer hardware. Same for phones, tablets... The main characteristic, for me, is that it should be user friendly. That is very difficult i know, because you have to imagine what the people using your software are going to do with it and how they want to use it, that's the magic you need to solve.\n\nIs command line user friendly ? \nWell, somehow you have to learn the command langage that is in fact a computer langage where you can make all the constructs that other langages offers.\nYou can create loops, you can test, whatever. It's not so different from computer langages like C or JAVA or whatever. \n\nBut it's already software no ? User friendly depends on what you put behind these words, no ? \nYes it's already software. I don't have a strong opinion about command lines. It depends on people. I can imagine that someone that have never heard about the command line expect that you click somewhere and it happens. But if you know the command langage it's sometimes perhaps easier or productive to type commands and let it run. Sometimes, i find it easier if i have a screen and a number of buttons and i don't have to imagine what happens behind that screen. And sometimes i want to do something with the command line, because i'm used to it. That's why i don't trust myself about user friendliness because i have a long experience in computer interfaces. I'm so used to some of them perhaps i can't even imagine that somebody else would like to do it otherwise or doesn't like what i'm used to.\n\nApart from maintaining the museum, what do you work on ? You are still active in the department even though you are retired ? \nI work on sensors, in the internet of things world in one of the university spin-off. What i do for them is sensors wireless need power, and some of them are on batteries. They have designed a complete system which should makes the battery lasts for two, three, four years. They need a system to measure that. So i been working on a mechanism to measure that without waiting four years. That's programming instrumentation computers to mesure power or whatever, that's part Unix systems. There are enough new or unknown things and maybe because i'm older, i have another way of looking at things, so we have a lot of discussions. They don't like my Pearl, they use python, JAVA those things...Pearl, it has it's disavantage, but you could do a lot of thing, each character has a meaning. With Python, you need all those libraries...It's easy when you know the libraries you have to call. When you know the arguments of the librairies...so it's also complicated. ANd if the library change for some reasons, there you go. In my humble opinion it's the same with all the l\n\n\n\n","attribs":"|1+g*6|2+2*5+3p*6|1+1*5+4f*6|2+2+dm*6|2+2+4n*6|1+1|1+1*5+11*6|2+2+bc*6|2+2+5z*2+3e*3+1*4*3+20*4+1*6|2+2+e7*6|2+2+7n*6|2+2*5+1a*6|2+2+53*6|2+2*5+19*6|2+2+c7*6|2+2*5+1r*6|2+2+jo*6|1+1+41*6|2+2*5+1a*6|2+2+5g*6|2+2*5+2w*6|2+2+l6*6|2+2*5+1f*6|2+2+8f*5+7+kh*6|1+1+uu*0|1+1+9s*0|2+2*5+1v*0|1+1+aj*0|2+2*5+5m*0|1+1+30*0|1+1+48*2+15+9l*0|1+1+1*0|1+1+1*5+1y*0|1+1+tm*0|1+1+1*0|1+1*5+4t*0|1+1+dr*0|1+1+u6*0|2+2*5+x*0|1+1+5q*0|2+2*5+1q*0|1+1+5w*0|2+2*5+16*0|1+1+5b*0|1+1+3l*0|2+2*5+o*0|1+1+df*0|2+2*5+u*0|1+1+bs*0|2+2*5+29*0|1+1+eh*0|2+2*5+1s*0|1+1+7m*0|2+2*5+u*0|1+1+fk*0|2+2*5+w*0|1+1+48*0|1+1+3b*0|2+2*5+2m*0|1+1+m9*0|2+2*5+3i*0|1+1+sa*0+1e*6|3+3|1+1"}}},"pad:observatory.guide.jeanhuensitvextended:revs:7201":{"changeset":"Z:dui>3|2m=d0q=to*0+3$ang","meta":{"author":"a.kqv62Q3nhchdwIuK","timestamp":1518102845434}},"pad:observatory.guide.jeanhuensitvextended:revs:7202":{"changeset":"Z:dul>1|2m=d0q=tr*0+1$a","meta":{"author":"a.kqv62Q3nhchdwIuK","timestamp":1518102846084}},"pad:observatory.guide.jeanhuensitvextended:revs:7203":{"changeset":"Z:dum>3|2m=d0q=ts*0+3$ges","meta":{"author":"a.kqv62Q3nhchdwIuK","timestamp":1518102846584}},"pad:observatory.guide.jeanhuensitvextended:revs:7204":{"changeset":"Z:dup>2|2m=d0q=tv*0+2$.

__NOPUBLISH__\n\n\n**You have been using computers since a long time, as you explained us during the tour we had the joy of assisting during the TGSO.**\n**I heard that that until recently, let's say the late 1990's, when learning computer programming you had to start by  writing down the program on paper... ** \n\nIn 1973, i did study computer sciences, it was the second year of the department, here in Leuven. At the time computers were mainframes and you did fed them with programms by punch cards. Programing was writing down the program, than you punched it and the next day you get results, mostly error. That's the way it worked at that time. To teach us programing, they used the langage of that time, Fortran and some kind of invented assembly langage, it didn't really exist, it was simplified.\n\nMost of the time you did write down your program, the teacher and the assistant would have to tell you what is wrong or good, you didn't had much practical experience.\n\n**How was it like, tons of pages ?** \n\nNo. As an anecdocte, i remember punchcards were a block of papers, we were jealous of the people who came in the computer center with huge stacks of cards. That were really small programs, not complicated one. The fact you had to learn to use the computer from scratch, everything was new, you couldn't rely on previous experiences, everything was new. And to start with small programs was difficult enough. \n\nThat was also the time when Edsger W. Dijkstra who forked the goto... i still remember him, in an audience, giving us a lecture on modernisation in programming at the International computing symposium 1977 in Liège (programming: from craft to scientific discipline https://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/EWD/transcriptions/EWD05xx/EWD566.html). He told usxx (i'll complete it as soon as possible. i need Jean's input)\"\n\nAnd then from 75 on, computers became cheaper and could be bought by departments and smaller entities. And than came the first interactive computer. Still beasts about two cubic meters, costing two millions belgian francs. But it was low enough to allow people to type in directly commands. I started working here in 75 as a researcher, it have evolved continuously and i saw computer getting cheaper and getting easier to use.The way to use it was simplified, you could start to go to the beast and try it out.\n\nI remember more or less: you did write down the program in Fortran for instance… We always thought in the beginning that it would work and it didn't, so after a turn around you were giving it back to the operator and you have to wait half a day or a night to get the results.\n\n**What kind of program you were working on?** \n\nI remember the first program i had to write was you got three numbers, you had to make the program decide if you construct a triangle with the numbers being the sides of the triangle.\n\n**That took an afternoon to be processed ?** \n\nWell, yeah. You had to imagine how to do it which was also one problem, than you prepare the card with the punching machine and you give the package of cards to the operator who was feeeding the computer with the cards. People had the taks to fed the computers by hands, with paper, cards, than disks and it lasts onto the magnetic disks period. And after a number of hours or a night you get a listing, a piece of paper, with the results.\n\n**When where you able to record the program onto the machine?**\n\nI think that happens between 75 and 80. After the punching cards which was already a way to record the program, we had  typewriters, terminals but we could record the programs, we could store them on the computer. We had magnetic discs. IBM had number for everything, i remember the 33-30 [manufactured from 1970 on] had a magnetic disk. We didn't touch the machines, operators would change the disks, we could only access the typewriter. That was our most direct connexion to the computer. Thetimes were diffent. The mainframes were such huge costly beasts that it had operators day and night keeping it busy. Even at night there were two or three guys mounting tapes, dismounting tapes, that kind of stuff.\nhttps://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/42/IBM_magnetic_disk_drives_3330%2B3333.png/600px-IBM_magnetic_disk_drives_3330%2B3333.png\n\n**When did you stop working with operators?** \n\nSomewhere between 85 and 90. There were still operators at the main computer of the university, but there were also small computers, so researchers and student can have direct access when needed. \n\n**When did you start to work with software sold by others or gived away in order to do your research?** \n\nYou stil need an operating system on the mainframe that was delivered by IBM or the constructor delivering the mainframe. When you bought mini-computers, which were the  smaller versions of mainframes, in most cases you did buy an operating systems, compilers and all the stuff you need to be able to program those things. In most cases, because the computer sciences department did buy the mini-computer from, for instance *digital equipment corporation*,  a manufactorer of that time, but they didn't buy their software. They were not open source or free,  but you could get Unix and could run it on those digital equipment (DEC) computers. That is what the computer department of the University of Louvain la Neuve *l'unité d'informatique*, did and so did we.\n\n**When did you start working with unix as an os?** \n\nI took a trip to Amsterdam, it must have been in 1979/80… Well, the story starts in our french sister university (LLN) where they did have a PDP-11 with Unix on it https://hackadaycom.files.wordpress.com/2016/08/full-size-pdp11.jpg. You got Unix, at the time, when you were a university, from Bell Aps (Ma Bell), the american telephone company. It was a mega organisation at the time [before the [dismantlment of AT&T/Bell system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breakup_of_the_Bell_System)].Due to monopoly, the US authorities splitted up in different Baby Bells. One of the restriction was there was a research baby bell, they couldn't really sell anything.There were computer scientists there, who did developped some Unix interesting things.  For universities you did get the source and no support for free. How to install it, no idea. In Unité d'informatique, they were lucky: they got the same computer that unix were developped on.  They got the disk by snail mail as a post-office package. They mounted it and it did spin up and they had it.\nHere, we did have a cheaper PDP11 (DEC - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PDP-11) We go the disk source from Bell Aps but we could not run it. We could look at it but that was all, because our disc format was different than the one at Bell Aps. Somebody here did write a driver for that disk and we did compiled it in l'unité d'informatique of LLN.  it did compile it but we couldn't try it because we did not have So we find the nearest Unix system compatiblewith ours, it was in Amsterdam.  Andrew Tenebaum who did write since then a number of books about operating systems and became quite an authority. He was working there. It was the young Tanenbaum, just arriving from United States to Amsterdam. He was learning to speak dutch. We did understood his english better but his assistant insisted that he speaks dutch because he will have to pass an exam in dutch. There we got a disk, than also the one with the driver we compiled, than we got here and we start using Unix.  Than in my opinion the start of open source was Unix because we had to maintain it by ourselves and we learned a lot from the sources.\nIn that time we did had to get software and it brings us to different places. For example, at the time the agents at the custom at the airport or post didn't know what to do with the discs in terms of custom clearance. They used magnetic or xrays, we had to write on the package that it should not be x-rayed. But we got time to time unreadable discs. \n\n**So it took like weeks between the transportation, the custom...**\nYes, the custom had to clear the packages. I remember i've been in the customs in Zaventem. I had received a letter that my package from Bell Aps had arrived. I went there thinking i would have to pay something and go. But no. It had to be cleared so there wa some organisation that had to do administrative stuff, so i only got it a few days later. The response time was huge :)\n\n**Than after that period of time how did you switch from that kind of collaboration on how to make software and make software work to collaboration on networks, between universities and researchers...**\nIn the Unix system of that time there was a kind of networking protocol which only did work on serial lines.\n You could connect two unix systems together you only need a line. We had one between LLN and Leuven, it's only 15 kms, but we had to ask Belgacom, than La Régie des télégraphes et téléphones, to get a modem to connect through their network and than over that modem you could reach an amazing speed of 300 characters per second. And that was the first communication. It did happened somewhere around 85. And then you had connexion with another computer, writing something here and do  something. And we could send programs to each other. \n \n **What was the first thing you did send through a network like this?**\n I didn't do it myself, i remember it was a kind of chat program. And on LLN side was Elie Milgrom, he is retired now. On this side, it was Pr Willems. And i remember that they typed something and they got a response from the other side and that was it.  But i remember that Pr Willems sent \"ok we stop now\". And that Elie Milgrom answered \"See you later, Alligator\" [a reference to Bill Haley and the Comets].  At the time we still had these kind of songs in mind. (lol). Those Unix to Unix connexions were first. And there was a worldwide Unix to Unix based network, Usenet (1979), it still exists somewhere... you can download load  of illegal movies and that stuff, that was not what we meant at the time. But that is what is left. And Usenet became gradually replaced by the Internet in USA. In Europe, the Internet came a lot later, but we had access to the Internet, we could send mail to them and we could receive mail from them, because some friendly american university, later companies, did translate internet mail to UCP mail. That was before the 1990's.\n \n **Your relation to software had changed at the time because you did not have to do all this manipulations with the software your received... Was it already floppy discs ?**\n No, magnetic tapes, for the mainframe at least. Most of the mini-computers had some cheaper magnetic tapes. Between 90 and 95 the main machines for the software institute was a VAX from DEC. Once a year the software came from Berkeley, it was still Unix but modified by Berkeley for virtual memory and all the stuff which are common now. We received a tape, with lot of goodies, i still remember we didn't know what was on there but we scrutinised there to know what was there, what we can use.\nIn Europe, companies like Siemens were trying to set up software centers to make software avaiable, they were even trying to set up networks. Researchers did love the Internet, it worked, it was useful for their researchs. So companies in Europe, were trying to set up their own networks, i remember for example the X/OPEN transport protocol. Their was a lot of standards about what software layers should do, but it didn't succeed because sometime, 92 maybe, IBM decided to quit their own private network and to go forTCP/IP and was the switching point. Everything done for X/OPEN were suddently forgotten. For the mainframes, and certainly in Belgium computing was mainly mainframes, i'm talking about universities here, so when IBM decided to go for TCP/IP we followed even though things were really slow. For example, Belgacom was not interested in running the Domain Name System so we did it here, for some time, starting in 1993 with Pierre Verbaten (https://www.dnsbelgium.be/en/history). Belgacom were focused on X25 (DCS - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X.25) so they missed it.\n\nIt was like the french Minitel ? \nWell, at that time we were really jealous about Minitel. Could you imagine that? Terminals?  At home ? You could work home with a computer ! You could send emails ! All in one, a pc computer with a modem ! \n\nHow did the research about software evolved in the department?\nI am mainly talking about network research but here there were people working on numerical analysis, computing, artificial intelligence ... I was just not involved in those research so i don't know much about it \n\nYou were focused on software and network..\nYes, we did produce some software. We did make software to generate compilers, there was some A.I. software in Prolog, numerical analysis  libraries... Some were sold or shared, it depends.  \nWe did sell some software since the beginning i think when it was not even a department but a professor and a couple of students.\n\nIs it when you joined ? \nNo it was already a department. I did study dutch industrial engeneering in electronics. At the time in electronics you did hear something about computers, i was interested in it i wanted to know more. I heard they had started a year before a degree in computer engeneering. It was the first year where industrial engineer could join. The only thing we knew about computer were in movies. I wanted to know how it work. I'm not sure i still know now even if maybe i have some ideas...\n\nHow many langage do you know ?\nAssembly, FORTRAN, PL-1 the langage invented by IBM to be the universal one, C, Cobol. Perl, i don't know, so more. I'm not fluent in any other langages, but i can read any langage especially well writtened, i know i can understand it and learn it...I know JAVA also. As a system administrator the thing i use most are the command line of UNIX and Perl. But that's because i'm more familiar with those two so it goes faster.\n\nHow did you see the rise of personnal computer and the software that goes with ? \nI have to admit that we missed it. We didn't see that what was new was powerful. We were not impressed by the software. I remember windows 95, the news on TV, people sleeping on the street to get it. I remember when i get my first windows version, with a box of 22 floppies or so. Then i wanted to do something, to compile a program, but there was no compiler. We were used to Unix, a basic system but with a lot of utilities in it. Software was for us free, and we were used to have it free and it was not free anymore. \n\nDoes that mean you didn't had a personnal computer until late ? \nYes. I think it was round 2000. I didn't needed it really. I got one when the belgian UCP network became commercial. Of course i did not get Windows on it.  I think we got Linux here in 1994. There was a guy involved in the kernel studying here. So we did used it very fast.\n\nSo, what is software for you ?\nFor me software is the magic that make computer usable. I can only gives examples of what i mean by it. A PC without software most people, even computer scientists, can't do anything with it. You need basic software. Some software are already integrated in the computer hardware. Same for phones, tablets... The main characteristic, for me, is that it should be user friendly. That is very difficult i know, because you have to imagine what the people using your software are going to do with it and how they want to use it, that's the magic you need to solve.\n\nIs command line user friendly ? \nWell, somehow you have to learn the command langage that is in fact a computer langage where you can make all the constructs that other langages offers.\nYou can create loops, you can test, whatever. It's not so different from computer langages like C or JAVA or whatever. \n\nBut it's already software no ? User friendly depends on what you put behind these words, no ? \nYes it's already software. I don't have a strong opinion about command lines. It depends on people. I can imagine that someone that have never heard about the command line expect that you click somewhere and it happens. But if you know the command langage it's sometimes perhaps easier or productive to type commands and let it run. Sometimes, i find it easier if i have a screen and a number of buttons and i don't have to imagine what happens behind that screen. And sometimes i want to do something with the command line, because i'm used to it. That's why i don't trust myself about user friendliness because i have a long experience in computer interfaces. I'm so used to some of them perhaps i can't even imagine that somebody else would like to do it otherwise or doesn't like what i'm used to.\n\nApart from maintaining the museum, what do you work on ? You are still active in the department even though you are retired ? \nI work on sensors, in the internet of things world in one of the university spin-off. What i do for them is sensors wireless need power, and some of them are on batteries. They have designed a complete system which should makes the battery lasts for two, three, four years. They need a system to measure that. So i been working on a mechanism to measure that without waiting four years. That's programming instrumentation computers to mesure power or whatever, that's part Unix systems. There are enough new or unknown things and maybe because i'm older, i have another way of looking at things, so we have a lot of discussions. They don't like my Pearl, they use python, JAVA those things...Pearl, it has it's disavantage, but you could do a lot of thing, each character has a meaning. With Python, you need all those libraries...It's easy when you know the libraries you have to call. When you know the arguments of the librairies...so it's also complicated.

__NOPUBLISH__\n\n\n**You have been using computers since a long time, as you explained us during the tour we had the joy of assisting during the TGSO.**\n**I heard that that until recently, let's say the late 1990's, when learning computer programming you had to start by  writing down the program on paper... ** \n\nIn 1973, i did study computer sciences, it was the second year of the department, here in Leuven. At the time computers were mainframes and you did fed them with programms by punch cards. Programing was writing down the program, than you punched it and the next day you get results, mostly error. That's the way it worked at that time. To teach us programing, they used the langage of that time, Fortran and some kind of invented assembly langage, it didn't really exist, it was simplified.\n\nMost of the time you did write down your program, the teacher and the assistant would have to tell you what is wrong or good, you didn't had much practical experience.\n\n**How was it like, tons of pages ?** \n\nNo. As an anecdocte, i remember punchcards were a block of papers, we were jealous of the people who came in the computer center with huge stacks of cards. That were really small programs, not complicated one. The fact you had to learn to use the computer from scratch, everything was new, you couldn't rely on previous experiences, everything was new. And to start with small programs was difficult enough. \n\nThat was also the time when Edsger W. Dijkstra who forked the goto... i still remember him, in an audience, giving us a lecture on modernisation in programming at the International computing symposium 1977 in Liège (programming: from craft to scientific discipline https://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/EWD/transcriptions/EWD05xx/EWD566.html). He told usxx (i'll complete it as soon as possible. i need Jean's input)\"\n\nAnd then from 75 on, computers became cheaper and could be bought by departments and smaller entities. And than came the first interactive computer. Still beasts about two cubic meters, costing two millions belgian francs. But it was low enough to allow people to type in directly commands. I started working here in 75 as a researcher, it have evolved continuously and i saw computer getting cheaper and getting easier to use.The way to use it was simplified, you could start to go to the beast and try it out.\n\nI remember more or less: you did write down the program in Fortran for instance… We always thought in the beginning that it would work and it didn't, so after a turn around you were giving it back to the operator and you have to wait half a day or a night to get the results.\n\n**What kind of program you were working on?** \n\nI remember the first program i had to write was you got three numbers, you had to make the program decide if you construct a triangle with the numbers being the sides of the triangle.\n\n**That took an afternoon to be processed ?** \n\nWell, yeah. You had to imagine how to do it which was also one problem, than you prepare the card with the punching machine and you give the package of cards to the operator who was feeeding the computer with the cards. People had the taks to fed the computers by hands, with paper, cards, than disks and it lasts onto the magnetic disks period. And after a number of hours or a night you get a listing, a piece of paper, with the results.\n\n**When where you able to record the program onto the machine?**\n\nI think that happens between 75 and 80. After the punching cards which was already a way to record the program, we had  typewriters, terminals but we could record the programs, we could store them on the computer. We had magnetic discs. IBM had number for everything, i remember the 33-30 [manufactured from 1970 on] had a magnetic disk. We didn't touch the machines, operators would change the disks, we could only access the typewriter. That was our most direct connexion to the computer. Thetimes were diffent. The mainframes were such huge costly beasts that it had operators day and night keeping it busy. Even at night there were two or three guys mounting tapes, dismounting tapes, that kind of stuff.\nhttps://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/42/IBM_magnetic_disk_drives_3330%2B3333.png/600px-IBM_magnetic_disk_drives_3330%2B3333.png\n\n**When did you stop working with operators?** \n\nSomewhere between 85 and 90. There were still operators at the main computer of the university, but there were also small computers, so researchers and student can have direct access when needed. \n\n**When did you start to work with software sold by others or gived away in order to do your research?** \n\nYou stil need an operating system on the mainframe that was delivered by IBM or the constructor delivering the mainframe. When you bought mini-computers, which were the  smaller versions of mainframes, in most cases you did buy an operating systems, compilers and all the stuff you need to be able to program those things. In most cases, because the computer sciences department did buy the mini-computer from, for instance *digital equipment corporation*,  a manufactorer of that time, but they didn't buy their software. They were not open source or free,  but you could get Unix and could run it on those digital equipment (DEC) computers. That is what the computer department of the University of Louvain la Neuve *l'unité d'informatique*, did and so did we.\n\n**When did you start working with unix as an os?** \n\nI took a trip to Amsterdam, it must have been in 1979/80… Well, the story starts in our french sister university (LLN) where they did have a PDP-11 with Unix on it https://hackadaycom.files.wordpress.com/2016/08/full-size-pdp11.jpg. You got Unix, at the time, when you were a university, from Bell Aps (Ma Bell), the american telephone company. It was a mega organisation at the time [before the [dismantlment of AT&T/Bell system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breakup_of_the_Bell_System)].Due to monopoly, the US authorities splitted up in different Baby Bells. One of the restriction was there was a research baby bell, they couldn't really sell anything.There were computer scientists there, who did developped some Unix interesting things.  For universities you did get the source and no support for free. How to install it, no idea. In Unité d'informatique, they were lucky: they got the same computer that unix were developped on.  They got the disk by snail mail as a post-office package. They mounted it and it did spin up and they had it.\nHere, we did have a cheaper PDP11 (DEC - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PDP-11) We go the disk source from Bell Aps but we could not run it. We could look at it but that was all, because our disc format was different than the one at Bell Aps. Somebody here did write a driver for that disk and we did compiled it in l'unité d'informatique of LLN.  it did compile it but we couldn't try it because we did not have So we find the nearest Unix system compatiblewith ours, it was in Amsterdam.  Andrew Tenebaum who did write since then a number of books about operating systems and became quite an authority. He was working there. It was the young Tanenbaum, just arriving from United States to Amsterdam. He was learning to speak dutch. We did understood his english better but his assistant insisted that he speaks dutch because he will have to pass an exam in dutch. There we got a disk, than also the one with the driver we compiled, than we got here and we start using Unix.  Than in my opinion the start of open source was Unix because we had to maintain it by ourselves and we learned a lot from the sources.\nIn that time we did had to get software and it brings us to different places. For example, at the time the agents at the custom at the airport or post didn't know what to do with the discs in terms of custom clearance. They used magnetic or xrays, we had to write on the package that it should not be x-rayed. But we got time to time unreadable discs. \n\n**So it took like weeks between the transportation, the custom...**\nYes, the custom had to clear the packages. I remember i've been in the customs in Zaventem. I had received a letter that my package from Bell Aps had arrived. I went there thinking i would have to pay something and go. But no. It had to be cleared so there wa some organisation that had to do administrative stuff, so i only got it a few days later. The response time was huge :)\n\n**Than after that period of time how did you switch from that kind of collaboration on how to make software and make software work to collaboration on networks, between universities and researchers...**\nIn the Unix system of that time there was a kind of networking protocol which only did work on serial lines.\n You could connect two unix systems together you only need a line. We had one between LLN and Leuven, it's only 15 kms, but we had to ask Belgacom, than La Régie des télégraphes et téléphones, to get a modem to connect through their network and than over that modem you could reach an amazing speed of 300 characters per second. And that was the first communication. It did happened somewhere around 85. And then you had connexion with another computer, writing something here and do  something. And we could send programs to each other. \n \n **What was the first thing you did send through a network like this?**\n I didn't do it myself, i remember it was a kind of chat program. And on LLN side was Elie Milgrom, he is retired now. On this side, it was Pr Willems. And i remember that they typed something and they got a response from the other side and that was it.  But i remember that Pr Willems sent \"ok we stop now\". And that Elie Milgrom answered \"See you later, Alligator\" [a reference to Bill Haley and the Comets].  At the time we still had these kind of songs in mind. (lol). Those Unix to Unix connexions were first. And there was a worldwide Unix to Unix based network, Usenet (1979), it still exists somewhere... you can download load  of illegal movies and that stuff, that was not what we meant at the time. But that is what is left. And Usenet became gradually replaced by the Internet in USA. In Europe, the Internet came a lot later, but we had access to the Internet, we could send mail to them and we could receive mail from them, because some friendly american university, later companies, did translate internet mail to UCP mail. That was before the 1990's.\n \n **Your relation to software had changed at the time because you did not have to do all this manipulations with the software your received... Was it already floppy discs ?**\n No, magnetic tapes, for the mainframe at least. Most of the mini-computers had some cheaper magnetic tapes. Between 90 and 95 the main machines for the software institute was a VAX from DEC. Once a year the software came from Berkeley, it was still Unix but modified by Berkeley for virtual memory and all the stuff which are common now. We received a tape, with lot of goodies, i still remember we didn't know what was on there but we scrutinised there to know what was there, what we can use.\nIn Europe, companies like Siemens were trying to set up software centers to make software avaiable, they were even trying to set up networks. Researchers did love the Internet, it worked, it was useful for their researchs. So companies in Europe, were trying to set up their own networks, i remember for example the X/OPEN transport protocol. Their was a lot of standards about what software layers should do, but it didn't succeed because sometime, 92 maybe, IBM decided to quit their own private network and to go forTCP/IP and was the switching point. Everything done for X/OPEN were suddently forgotten. For the mainframes, and certainly in Belgium computing was mainly mainframes, i'm talking about universities here, so when IBM decided to go for TCP/IP we followed even though things were really slow. For example, Belgacom was not interested in running the Domain Name System so we did it here, for some time, starting in 1993 with Pierre Verbaten (https://www.dnsbelgium.be/en/history). Belgacom were focused on X25 (DCS - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X.25) so they missed it.\n\nIt was like the french Minitel ? \nWell, at that time we were really jealous about Minitel. Could you imagine that? Terminals?  At home ? You could work home with a computer ! You could send emails ! All in one, a pc computer with a modem ! \n\nHow did the research about software evolved in the department?\nI am mainly talking about network research but here there were people working on numerical analysis, computing, artificial intelligence ... I was just not involved in those research so i don't know much about it \n\nYou were focused on software and network..\nYes, we did produce some software. We did make software to generate compilers, there was some A.I. software in Prolog, numerical analysis  libraries... Some were sold or shared, it depends.  \nWe did sell some software since the beginning i think when it was not even a department but a professor and a couple of students.\n\nIs it when you joined ? \nNo it was already a department. I did study dutch industrial engeneering in electronics. At the time in electronics you did hear something about computers, i was interested in it i wanted to know more. I heard they had started a year before a degree in computer engeneering. It was the first year where industrial engineer could join. The only thing we knew about computer were in movies. I wanted to know how it work. I'm not sure i still know now even if maybe i have some ideas...\n\nHow many langage do you know ?\nAssembly, FORTRAN, PL-1 the langage invented by IBM to be the universal one, C, Cobol. Perl, i don't know, so more. I'm not fluent in any other langages, but i can read any langage especially well writtened, i know i can understand it and learn it...I know JAVA also. As a system administrator the thing i use most are the command line of UNIX and Perl. But that's because i'm more familiar with those two so it goes faster.\n\nHow did you see the rise of personnal computer and the software that goes with ? \nI have to admit that we missed it. We didn't see that what was new was powerful. We were not impressed by the software. I remember windows 95, the news on TV, people sleeping on the street to get it. I remember when i get my first windows version, with a box of 22 floppies or so. Then i wanted to do something, to compile a program, but there was no compiler. We were used to Unix, a basic system but with a lot of utilities in it. Software was for us free, and we were used to have it free and it was not free anymore. \n\nDoes that mean you didn't had a personnal computer until late ? \nYes. I think it was round 2000. I didn't needed it really. I got one when the belgian UCP network became commercial. Of course i did not get Windows on it.  I think we got Linux here in 1994. There was a guy involved in the kernel studying here. So we did used it very fast.\n\nSo, what is software for you ?\nFor me software is the magic that make computer usable. I can only gives examples of what i mean by it. A PC without software most people, even computer scientists, can't do anything with it. You need basic software. Some software are already integrated in the computer hardware. Same for phones, tablets... The main characteristic, for me, is that it should be user friendly. That is very difficult i know, because you have to imagine what the people using your software are going to do with it and how they want to use it, that's the magic you need to solve.\n\nIs command line user friendly ? \nWell, somehow you have to learn the command langage that is in fact a computer langage where you can make all the constructs that other langages offers.\nYou can create loops, you can test, whatever. It's not so different from computer langages like C or JAVA or whatever. \n\nBut it's already software no ? User friendly depends on what you put behind these words, no ? \nYes it's already software. I don't have a strong opinion about command lines. It depends on people. I can imagine that someone that have never heard about the command line expect that you click somewhere and it happens. But if you know the command langage it's sometimes perhaps easier or productive to type commands and let it run. Sometimes, i find it easier if i have a screen and a number of buttons and i don't have to imagine what happens behind that screen. And sometimes i want to do something with the command line, because i'm used to it. That's why i don't trust myself about user friendliness because i have a long experience in computer interfaces. I'm so used to some of them perhaps i can't even imagine that somebody else would like to do it otherwise or doesn't like what i'm used to.\n\nApart from maintaining the museum, what do you work on ? You are still active in the department even though you are retired ? \nI work on sensors, in the internet of things world in one of the university spin-off. What i do for them is sensors wireless need power, and some of them are on batteries. They have designed a complete system which should makes the battery lasts for two, three, four years. They need a system to measure that. So i been working on a mechanism to measure that without waiting four years. That's programming instrumentation computers to mesure power or whatever, that's part Unix systems. There are enough new or unknown things and maybe because i'm older, i have another way of looking at things, so we have a lot of discussions. They don't like my Pearl, they use python, JAVA those things...Pearl, it has it's disavantage, but you could do a lot of thing, each character has a meaning. With Python, you need all those libraries...It's easy when you know the libraries you have to call. When you know the arguments of the librairies...so it's also complicated. ANd if the library change for some reasons, there you go. In my humble opinion it's the same with all the langages. It's starts easy from scratch but if you have to interface them with existing thing from the internet world or whatever it gets complicated.\n\nDo you have a last word ? \nI was surprised by your group reaction to the visit. I thought all of this were known. Maybe i'm getting old :) Curently i don't do much about the museum department, but somet\n\n\n\n\n","attribs":"|1+g*6|2+2*5+3p*6|1+1*5+4f*6|2+2+dm*6|2+2+4n*6|1+1|1+1*5+11*6|2+2+bc*6|2+2+5z*2+3e*3+1*4*3+20*4+1*6|2+2+e7*6|2+2+7n*6|2+2*5+1a*6|2+2+53*6|2+2*5+19*6|2+2+c7*6|2+2*5+1r*6|2+2+jo*6|1+1+41*6|2+2*5+1a*6|2+2+5g*6|2+2*5+2w*6|2+2+l6*6|2+2*5+1f*6|2+2+8f*5+7+kh*6|1+1+uu*0|1+1+9s*0|2+2*5+1v*0|1+1+aj*0|2+2*5+5m*0|1+1+30*0|1+1+48*2+15+9l*0|1+1+1*0|1+1+1*5+1y*0|1+1+tm*0|1+1+1*0|1+1*5+4t*0|1+1+dr*0|1+1+u6*0|2+2*5+x*0|1+1+5q*0|2+2*5+1q*0|1+1+5w*0|2+2*5+16*0|1+1+5b*0|1+1+3l*0|2+2*5+o*0|1+1+df*0|2+2*5+u*0|1+1+bs*0|2+2*5+29*0|1+1+eh*0|2+2*5+1s*0|1+1+7m*0|2+2*5+u*0|1+1+fk*0|2+2*5+w*0|1+1+48*0|1+1+3b*0|2+2*5+2m*0|1+1+m9*0|2+2*5+3i*0|1+1+xt*0|2+2*0*5+q*0|2+4x*6|3+3|1+1"}}},"pad:observatory.guide.jeanhuensitvextended:revs:7401":{"changeset":"Z:e4c>3|2p=dzc=4v*0+3$ime","meta":{"author":"a.kqv62Q3nhchdwIuK","timestamp":1518110313803}},"pad:observatory.guide.jeanhuensitvextended:revs:7402":{"changeset":"Z:e4f>3|2p=dzc=4y*0+3$s

At the time computers were mainframes and you did fed them with programms by punch cards. Programing was writing down the program, than you punched it and the next day you get results, mostly error. That's the way it worked at that time. To teach us programing, they used the langage of that time, Fortran and some kind of invented assembly langage, it didn't really exist, it was simplified.\n\nMost of the time you did write down your program, the teacher and the assistant would have to tell you what is wrong or good, you didn't had much practical experience.\n\n**How was it like, tons of pages ?** \n\nNo. As an anecdocte, i remember punchcards were a block of papers, we were jealous of the people who came in the computer center with huge stacks of cards. That were really small programs, not complicated one. The fact you had to learn to use the computer from scratch, everything was new, you couldn't rely on previous experiences, everything was new. And to start with small programs was difficult enough. \n\nThat was also the time when Edsger W. Dijkstra who forked the goto... i still remember him, in an audience, giving us a lecture on modernisation in programming at the International computing symposium 1977 in Liège (programming: from craft to scientific discipline https://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/EWD/transcriptions/EWD05xx/EWD566.html). He told usxx (i'll complete it as soon as possible. i need Jean's input)\"\n\nAnd then from 75 on, computers became cheaper and could be bought by departments and smaller entities. And than came the first interactive computer. Still beasts about two cubic meters, costing two millions belgian francs. But it was low enough to allow people to type in directly commands. I started working here in 75 as a researcher, it have evolved continuously and i saw computer getting cheaper and getting easier to use.The way to use it was simplified, you could start to go to the beast and try it out.\n\nI remember more or less: you did write down the program in Fortran for instance… We always thought in the beginning that it would work and it didn't, so after a turn around you were giving it back to the operator and you have to wait half a day or a night to get the results.\n\n**What kind of program you were working on?** \n\nI remember the first program i had to write was you got three numbers, you had to make the program decide if you construct a triangle with the numbers being the sides of the triangle.\n\n**That took an afternoon to be processed ?** \n\nWell, yeah. You had to imagine how to do it which was also one problem, than you prepare the card with the punching machine and you give the package of cards to the operator who was feeeding the computer with the cards. People had the taks to fed the computers by hands, with paper, cards, than disks and it lasts onto the magnetic disks period. And after a number of hours or a night you get a listing, a piece of paper, with the results.\n\n**When where you able to record the program onto the machine?**\n\nI think that happens between 75 and 80. After the punching cards which was already a way to record the program, we had  typewriters, terminals but we could record the programs, we could store them on the computer. We had magnetic discs. IBM had number for everything, i remember the 33-30 [manufactured from 1970 on] had a magnetic disk. We didn't touch the machines, operators would change the disks, we could only access the typewriter. That was our most direct connexion to the computer. Thetimes were diffent. The mainframes were such huge costly beasts that it had operators day and night keeping it busy. Even at night there were two or three guys mounting tapes, dismounting tapes, that kind of stuff.\nhttps://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/42/IBM_magnetic_disk_drives_3330%2B3333.png/600px-IBM_magnetic_disk_drives_3330%2B3333.png\n\n**When did you stop working with operators?** \n\nSomewhere between 85 and 90. There were still operators at the main computer of the university, but there were also small computers, so researchers and student can have direct access when needed. \n\n**When did you start to work with software sold by others or gived away in order to do your research?** \n\nYou stil need an operating system on the mainframe that was delivered by IBM or the constructor delivering the mainframe. When you bought mini-computers, which were the  smaller versions of mainframes, in most cases you did buy an operating systems, compilers and all the stuff you need to be able to program those things. In most cases, because the computer sciences department did buy the mini-computer from, for instance *digital equipment corporation*,  a manufactorer of that time, but they didn't buy their software. They were not open source or free,  but you could get Unix and could run it on those digital equipment (DEC) computers. That is what the computer department of the University of Louvain la Neuve *l'unité d'informatique*, did and so did we.\n\n**When did you start working with unix as an os?** \n\nI took a trip to Amsterdam, it must have been in 1979/80… Well, the story starts in our french sister university (LLN) where they did have a PDP-11 with Unix on it https://hackadaycom.files.wordpress.com/2016/08/full-size-pdp11.jpg. You got Unix, at the time, when you were a university, from Bell Aps (Ma Bell), the american telephone company. It was a mega organisation at the time [before the [dismantlment of AT&T/Bell system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breakup_of_the_Bell_System)].Due to monopoly, the US authorities splitted up in different Baby Bells. One of the restriction was there was a research baby bell, they couldn't really sell anything.There were computer scientists there, who did developped some Unix interesting things.  For universities you did get the source and no support for free. How to install it, no idea. In Unité d'informatique, they were lucky: they got the same computer that unix were developped on.  They got the disk by snail mail as a post-office package. They mounted it and it did spin up and they had it.\nHere, we did have a cheaper PDP11 (DEC - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PDP-11) We go the disk source from Bell Aps but we could not run it. We could look at it but that was all, because our disc format was different than the one at Bell Aps. Somebody here did write a driver for that disk and we did compiled it in l'unité d'informatique of LLN.  it did compile it but we couldn't try it because we did not have So we find the nearest Unix system compatiblewith ours, it was in Amsterdam.  Andrew Tenebaum who did write since then a number of books about operating systems and became quite an authority. He was working there. It was the young Tanenbaum, just arriving from United States to Amsterdam. He was learning to speak dutch. We did understood his english better but his assistant insisted that he speaks dutch because he will have to pass an exam in dutch. There we got a disk, than also the one with the driver we compiled, than we got here and we start using Unix.  Than in my opinion the start of open source was Unix because we had to maintain it by ourselves and we learned a lot from the sources.\nIn that time we did had to get software and it brings us to different places. For example, at the time the agents at the custom at the airport or post didn't know what to do with the discs in terms of custom clearance. They used magnetic or xrays, we had to write on the package that it should not be x-rayed. But we got time to time unreadable discs. \n\n**So it took like weeks between the transportation, the custom...**\nYes, the custom had to clear the packages. I remember i've been in the customs in Zaventem. I had received a letter that my package from Bell Aps had arrived. I went there thinking i would have to pay something and go. But no. It had to be cleared so there wa some organisation that had to do administrative stuff, so i only got it a few days later. The response time was huge :)\n\n**Than after that period of time how did you switch from that kind of collaboration on how to make software and make software work to collaboration on networks, between universities and researchers...**\nIn the Unix system of that time there was a kind of networking protocol which only did work on serial lines.\n You could connect two unix systems together you only need a line. We had one between LLN and Leuven, it's only 15 kms, but we had to ask Belgacom, than La Régie des télégraphes et téléphones, to get a modem to connect through their network and than over that modem you could reach an amazing speed of 300 characters per second. And that was the first communication. It did happened somewhere around 85. And then you had connexion with another computer, writing something here and do  something. And we could send programs to each other. \n \n **What was the first thing you did send through a network like this?**\n I didn't do it myself, i remember it was a kind of chat program. And on LLN side was Elie Milgrom, he is retired now. On this side, it was Pr Willems. And i remember that they typed something and they got a response from the other side and that was it.  But i remember that Pr Willems sent \"ok we stop now\". And that Elie Milgrom answered \"See you later, Alligator\" [a reference to Bill Haley and the Comets].  At the time we still had these kind of songs in mind. (lol). Those Unix to Unix connexions were first. And there was a worldwide Unix to Unix based network, Usenet (1979), it still exists somewhere... you can download load  of illegal movies and that stuff, that was not what we meant at the time. But that is what is left. And Usenet became gradually replaced by the Internet in USA. In Europe, the Internet came a lot later, but we had access to the Internet, we could send mail to them and we could receive mail from them, because some friendly american university, later companies, did translate internet mail to UCP mail. That was before the 1990's.\n \n **Your relation to software had changed at the time because you did not have to do all this manipulations with the software your received... Was it already floppy discs ?**\n No, magnetic tapes, for the mainframe at least. Most of the mini-computers had some cheaper magnetic tapes. Between 90 and 95 the main machines for the software institute was a VAX from DEC. Once a year the software came from Berkeley, it was still Unix but modified by Berkeley for virtual memory and all the stuff which are common now. We received a tape, with lot of goodies, i still remember we didn't know what was on there but we scrutinised there to know what was there, what we can use.\nIn Europe, companies like Siemens were trying to set up software centers to make software avaiable, they were even trying to set up networks. Researchers did love the Internet, it worked, it was useful for their researchs. So companies in Europe, were trying to set up their own networks, i remember for example the X/OPEN transport protocol. Their was a lot of standards about what software layers should do, but it didn't succeed because sometime, 92 maybe, IBM decided to quit their own private network and to go forTCP/IP and was the switching point. Everything done for X/OPEN were suddently forgotten. For the mainframes, and certainly in Belgium computing was mainly mainframes, i'm talking about universities here, so when IBM decided to go for TCP/IP we followed even though things were really slow. For example, Belgacom was not interested in running the Domain Name System so we did it here, for some time, starting in 1993 with Pierre Verbaten (https://www.dnsbelgium.be/en/history). Belgacom were focused on X25 (DCS - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X.25) so they missed it.\n\nIt was like the french Minitel ? \nWell, at that time we were really jealous about Minitel. Could you imagine that? Terminals?  At home ? You could work home with a computer ! You could send emails ! All in one, a pc computer with a modem ! \n\nHow did the research about software evolved in the department?\nI am mainly talking about network research but here there were people working on numerical analysis, computing, artificial intelligence ... I was just not involved in those research so i don't know much about it \n\nYou were focused on software and network..\nYes, we did produce some software. We did make software to generate compilers, there was some A.I. software in Prolog, numerical analysis  libraries... Some were sold or shared, it depends.  \nWe did sell some software since the beginning i think when it was not even a department but a professor and a couple of students.\n\nIs it when you joined ? \nNo it was already a department. I did study dutch industrial engeneering in electronics. At the time in electronics you did hear something about computers, i was interested in it i wanted to know more. I heard they had started a year before a degree in computer engeneering. It was the first year where industrial engineer could join. The only thing we knew about computer were in movies. I wanted to know how it work. I'm not sure i still know now even if maybe i have some ideas...\n\nHow many langage do you know ?\nAssembly, FORTRAN, PL-1 the langage invented by IBM to be the universal one, C, Cobol. Perl, i don't know, so more. I'm not fluent in any other langages, but i can read any langage especially well writtened, i know i can understand it and learn it...I know JAVA also. As a system administrator the thing i use most are the command line of UNIX and Perl. But that's because i'm more familiar with those two so it goes faster.\n\nHow did you see the rise of personnal computer and the software that goes with ? \nI have to admit that we missed it. We didn't see that what was new was powerful. We were not impressed by the software. I remember windows 95, the news on TV, people sleeping on the street to get it. I remember when i get my first windows version, with a box of 22 floppies or so. Then i wanted to do something, to compile a program, but there was no compiler. We were used to Unix, a basic system but with a lot of utilities in it. Software was for us free, and we were used to have it free and it was not free anymore. \n\nDoes that mean you didn't had a personnal computer until late ? \nYes. I think it was round 2000. I didn't needed it really. I got one when the belgian UCP network became commercial. Of course i did not get Windows on it.  I think we got Linux here in 1994. There was a guy involved in the kernel studying here. So we did used it very fast.\n\nSo, what is software for you ?\nFor me software is the magic that make computer usable. I can only gives examples of what i mean by it. A PC without software most people, even computer scientists, can't do anything with it. You need basic software. Some software are already integrated in the computer hardware. Same for phones, tablets... The main characteristic, for me, is that it should be user friendly. That is very difficult i know, because you have to imagine what the people using your software are going to do with it and how they want to use it, that's the magic you need to solve.\n\nIs command line user friendly ? \nWell, somehow you have to learn the command langage that is in fact a computer langage where you can make all the constructs that other langages offers.\nYou can create loops, you can test, whatever. It's not so different from computer langages like C or JAVA or whatever. \n\nBut it's already software no ? User friendly depends on what you put behind these words, no ? \nYes it's already software. I don't have a strong opinion about command lines. It depends on people. I can imagine that someone that have never heard about the command line expect that you click somewhere and it happens. But if you know the command langage it's sometimes perhaps easier or productive to type commands and let it run. Sometimes, i find it easier if i have a screen and a number of buttons and i don't have to imagine what happens behind that screen. And sometimes i want to do something with the command line, because i'm used to it. That's why i don't trust myself about user friendliness because i have a long experience in computer interfaces. I'm so used to some of them perhaps i can't even imagine that somebody else would like to do it otherwise or doesn't like what i'm used to.\n\nApart from maintaining the museum, what do you work on ? You are still active in the department even though you are retired ? \nI work on sensors, in the internet of things world in one of the university spin-off. What i do for them is sensors wireless need power, and some of them are on batteries. They have designed a complete system which should makes the battery lasts for two, three, four years. They need a system to measure that. So i been working on a mechanism to measure that without waiting four years. That's programming instrumentation computers to mesure power or whatever, that's part Unix systems. There are enough new or unknown things and maybe because i'm older, i have another way of looking at things, so we have a lot of discussions. They don't like my Pearl, they use python, JAVA those things...Pearl, it has it's disavantage, but you could do a lot of thing, each character has a meaning. With Python, you need all those libraries...It's easy when you know the libraries you have to call. When you know the arguments of the librairies...so it's also complicated. ANd if the library change for some reasons, there you go. In my humble opinion it's the same with all the langages. It's starts easy from scratch but if you have to interface them with existing thing from the internet world or whatever it gets complicated.\n\nDo you have a last word ? \nI was surprised by your group reaction to the visit. I thought all of this were known. Maybe i'm getting old :) Curently i don't do much about the museum department, but sometimes i like to talk about the little stories about it. I remember a lot of little stories, a lot of technics who have been used and forgotten and some kept alive. I thought when i was young that the best

__NOPUBLISH__\n\n\n**You have been using computers since a long time, as you explained us during the tour we had the joy of assisting during the TGSO.**\n**I heard that that until recently, let's say the late 1990's, when learning computer programming you had to start by  writing down the program on paper... ** \n\nIn 1973, i did study computer sciences, it was the second year of the department, here in Leuven. At the time computers were mainframes and you did fed them with programms by punch cards. Programing was writing down the program, than you punched it and the next day you get results, mostly error. That's the way it worked at that time. To teach us programing, they used the langage of that time, Fortran and some kind of invented assembly langage, it didn't really exist, it was simplified.\n\nMost of the time you did write down your program, the teacher and the assistant would have to tell you what is wrong or good, you didn't had much practical experience.\n\n**How was it like, tons of pages ?** \n\nNo. As an anecdocte, i remember punchcards were a block of papers, we were jealous of the people who came in the computer center with huge stacks of cards. That were really small programs, not complicated one. The fact you had to learn to use the computer from scratch, everything was new, you couldn't rely on previous experiences, everything was new. And to start with small programs was difficult enough. \n\nThat was also the time when Edsger W. Dijkstra, who faught against the goto        and other then common but bad constructs. I still remember him, in an audience, giving us a lecture on good  techniques  in programming at the  International computing symposium 1977 in Liège (programming:  from craft to scientific discipline https://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/EWD/transcriptions/EWD05xx/EWD566.html). It was a rather hard course because Dijkstra expected you to quickly  understand and implement his ideas.\n\nAnd then from 75 on, computers became cheaper and could be bought by departments and smaller entities. And than came the first interactive computer. Still beasts about two cubic meters, costing two millions belgian francs. But it was low enough to allow people to type in directly commands. I started working here in 75 as a researcher, it have evolved continuously and i saw computer getting cheaper and getting easier to use.The way to use it was simplified, you could start to go to the beast and try it out.\n\nI remember more or less: you did write down the program in Fortran for instance… We always thought in the beginning that it would work and it didn't, so after a turn around you were giving it back to the operator and you have to wait half a day or a night to get the results.\n\n**What kind of program you were working on?** \n\nI remember the first program i had to write was you got three numbers, you had to make the program decide if you construct a triangle with the numbers being the sides of the triangle.\n\n**That took an afternoon to be processed ?** \n\nWell, yeah. You had to imagine how to do it which was also one problem, than you prepare the card with the punching machine and you give the package of cards to the operator who was feeeding the computer with the cards. People had the taks to fed the computers by hands, with paper, cards, than disks and it lasts onto the magnetic disks period. And after a number of hours or a night you get a listing, a piece of paper, with the results.\n\n**When where you able to record the program onto the machine?**\n\nI think that happens between 75 and 80. After the punching cards which was already a way to record the program, we had  typewriters, terminals but we could record the programs, we could store them on the computer. We had magnetic discs. IBM had number for everything, i remember the 33-30 [manufactured from 1970 on] had a magnetic disk. We didn't touch the machines, operators would change the disks, we could only access the typewriter. That was our most direct connexion to the computer. Thetimes were diffent. The mainframes were such huge costly beasts that it had operators day and night keeping it busy. Even at night there were two or three guys mounting tapes, dismounting tapes, that kind of stuff.\nhttps://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/42/IBM_magnetic_disk_drives_3330%2B3333.png/600px-IBM_magnetic_disk_drives_3330%2B3333.png\n\n**When did you stop working with operators?** \n\nSomewhere between 85 and 90. There were still operators at the main computer of the university, but there were also small computers, so researchers and student can have direct access when needed. \n\n**When did you start to work with software sold by others or gived away in order to do your research?** \n\nYou stil need an operating system on the mainframe that was delivered by IBM or the constructor delivering the mainframe. When you bought mini-computers, which were the  smaller versions of mainframes, in most cases you did buy an operating systems, compilers and all the stuff you need to be able to program those things. In most cases, because the computer sciences department did buy the mini-computer from, for instance *digital equipment corporation*,  a manufactorer of that time, but they didn't buy their software. They were not open source or free,  but you could get Unix and could run it on those digital equipment (DEC) computers. That is what the computer department of the University of Louvain la Neuve *l'unité d'informatique*, did and so did we.\n\n**When did you start working with unix as an os?** \n\nI took a trip to Amsterdam, it must have been in 1979/80… Well, the story starts in our french sister university (LLN) where they did have a PDP-11 with Unix on it https://hackadaycom.files.wordpress.com/2016/08/full-size-pdp11.jpg. You got Unix, at the time, when you were a university, from Bell Aps (Ma Bell), the american telephone company. It was a mega organisation at the time [before the [dismantlment of AT&T/Bell system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breakup_of_the_Bell_System)].Due to monopoly, the US authorities splitted up in different Baby Bells. One of the restriction was there was a research baby bell, they couldn't really sell anything.There were computer scientists there, who did developped some Unix interesting things.  For universities you did get the source and no support for free. How to install it, no idea. In Unité d'informatique, they were lucky: they got the same computer that unix were developped on.  They got the disk by snail mail as a post-office package. They mounted it and it did spin up and they had it.\nHere, we did have a cheaper PDP11 (DEC - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PDP-11) We go the disk source from Bell Aps but we could not run it. We could look at it but that was all, because our disc format was different than the one at Bell Aps. Somebody here did write a driver for that disk and we did compiled it in l'unité d'informatique of LLN.  it did compile it but we couldn't try it because we did not have So we find the nearest Unix system compatiblewith ours, it was in Amsterdam.  Andrew Tenebaum who did write since then a number of books about operating systems and became quite an authority. He was working there. It was the young Tanenbaum, just arriving from United States to Amsterdam. He was learning to speak dutch. We did understood his english better but his assistant insisted that he speaks dutch because he will have to pass an exam in dutch. There we got a disk, than also the one with the driver we compiled, than we got here and we start using Unix.  Than in my opinion the start of open source was Unix because we had to maintain it by ourselves and we learned a lot from the sources.\nIn that time we did had to get software and it brings us to different places. For example, at the time the agents at the custom at the airport or post didn't know what to do with the discs in terms of custom clearance. They used magnetic or xrays, we had to write on the package that it should not be x-rayed. But we got time to time unreadable discs. \n\n**So it took like weeks between the transportation, the custom...**\nYes, the custom had to clear the packages. I remember i've been in the customs in Zaventem. I had received a letter that my package from Bell Aps had arrived. I went there thinking i would have to pay something and go. But no. It had to be cleared so there wa some organisation that had to do administrative stuff, so i only got it a few days later. The response time was huge :)\n\n**Than after that period of time how did you switch from that kind of collaboration on how to make software and make software work to collaboration on networks, between universities and researchers...**\nIn the Unix system of that time there was a kind of networking protocol which only did work on serial lines.\n You could connect two unix systems together you only need a line. We had one between LLN and Leuven, it's only 15 kms, but we had to ask Belgacom, than La Régie des télégraphes et téléphones, to get a modem to connect through their network and than over that modem you could reach an amazing speed of 300 characters per second. And that was the first communication. It did happened somewhere around 85. And then you had connexion with another computer, writing something here and do  something. And we could send programs to each other. \n \n **What was the first thing you did send through a network like this?**\n I didn't do it myself, i remember it was a kind of chat program. And on LLN side was Elie Milgrom, he is retired now. On this side, it was Pr Willems. And i remember that they typed something and they got a response from the other side and that was it.  But i remember that Pr Willems sent \"ok we stop now\". And that Elie Milgrom answered \"See you later, Alligator\" [a reference to Bill Haley and the Comets].  At the time we still had these kind of songs in mind. (lol). Those Unix to Unix connexions were first. And there was a worldwide Unix to Unix based network, Usenet (1979), it still exists somewhere... you can download load  of illegal movies and that stuff, that was not what we meant at the time. But that is what is left. And Usenet became gradually replaced by the Internet in USA. In Europe, the Internet came a lot later, but we had access to the Internet, we could send mail to them and we could receive mail from them, because some friendly american university, later companies, did translate internet mail to UCP mail. That was before the 1990's.\n \n **Your relation to software had changed at the time because you did not have to do all this manipulations with the software your received... Was it already floppy discs ?**\n No, magnetic tapes, for the mainframe at least. Most of the mini-computers had some cheaper magnetic tapes. Between 90 and 95 the main machines for the software institute was a VAX from DEC. Once a year the software came from Berkeley, it was still Unix but modified by Berkeley for virtual memory and all the stuff which are common now. We received a tape, with lot of goodies, i still remember we didn't know what was on there but we scrutinised there to know what was there, what we can use.\nIn Europe, companies like Siemens were trying to set up software centers to make software avaiable, they were even trying to set up networks. Researchers did love the Internet, it worked, it was useful for their researchs. So companies in Europe, were trying to set up their own networks, i remember for example the X/OPEN transport protocol. Their was a lot of standards about what software layers should do, but it didn't succeed because sometime, 92 maybe, IBM decided to quit their own private network and to go forTCP/IP and was the switching point. Everything done for X/OPEN were suddently forgotten. For the mainframes, and certainly in Belgium computing was mainly mainframes, i'm talking about universities here, so when IBM decided to go for TCP/IP we followed even though things were really slow. For example, Belgacom was not interested in running the Domain Name System so we did it here, for some time, starting in 1993 with Pierre Verbaten (https://www.dnsbelgium.be/en/history). Belgacom were focused on X25 (DCS - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X.25) so they missed it.\n\nIt was like the french Minitel ? \nWell, at that time we were really jealous about Minitel. Could you imagine that? Terminals?  At home ? You could work home with a computer ! You could send emails ! All in one, a pc computer with a modem ! \n\nHow did the research about software evolved in the department?\nI am mainly talking about network research but here there were people working on numerical analysis, computing, artificial intelligence ... I was just not involved in those research so i don't know much about it \n\nYou were focused on software and network..\nYes, we did produce some software. We did make software to generate compilers, there was some A.I. software in Prolog, numerical analysis  libraries... Some were sold or shared, it depends.  \nWe did sell some software since the beginning i think when it was not even a department but a professor and a couple of students.\n\nIs it when you joined ? \nNo it was already a department. I did study dutch industrial engeneering in electronics. At the time in electronics you did hear something about computers, i was interested in it i wanted to know more. I heard they had started a year before a degree in computer engeneering. It was the first year where industrial engineer could join. The only thing we knew about computer were in movies. I wanted to know how it work. I'm not sure i still know now even if maybe i have some ideas...\n\nHow many langage do you know ?\nAssembly, FORTRAN, PL-1 the langage invented by IBM to be the universal one, C, Cobol. Perl, i don't know, so more. I'm not fluent in any other langages, but i can read any langage especially well writtened, i know i can understand it and learn it...I know JAVA also. As a system administrator the thing i use most are the command line of UNIX and Perl. But that's because i'm more familiar with those two so it goes faster.\n\nHow did you see the rise of personnal computer and the software that goes with ? \nI have to admit that we missed it. We didn't see that what was new was powerful. We were not impressed by the software. I remember windows 95, the news on TV, people sleeping on the street to get it. I remember when i get my first windows version, with a box of 22 floppies or so. Then i wanted to do something, to compile a program, but there was no compiler. We were used to Unix, a basic system but with a lot of utilities in it. Software was for us free, and we were used to have it free and it was not free anymore. \n\nDoes that mean you didn't had a personnal computer until late ? \nYes. I think it was round 2000. I didn't needed it really. I got one when the belgian UCP network became commercial. Of course i did not get Windows on it.  I think we got Linux here in 1994. There was a guy involved in the kernel studying here. So we did used it very fast.\n\nSo, what is software for you ?\nFor me software is the magic that make computer usable. I can only gives examples of what i mean by it. A PC without software most people, even computer scientists, can't do anything with it. You need basic software. Some software are already integrated in the computer hardware. Same for phones, tablets... The main characteristic, for me, is that it should be user friendly. That is very difficult i know, because you have to imagine what the people using your software are going to do with it and how they want to use it, that's the magic you need to solve.\n\nIs command line user friendly ? \nWell, somehow you have to learn the command langage that is in fact a computer langage where you can make all the constructs that other langages offers.\nYou can create loops, you can test, whatever. It's not so different from computer langages like C or JAVA or whatever. \n\nBut it's already software no ? User friendly depends on what you put behind these words, no ? \nYes it's already software. I don't have a strong opinion about command lines. It depends on people. I can imagine that someone that have never heard about the command line expect that you click somewhere and it happens. But if you know the command langage it's sometimes perhaps easier or productive to type commands and let it run. Sometimes, i find it easier if i have a screen and a number of buttons and i don't have to imagine what happens behind that screen. And sometimes i want to do something with the command line, because i'm used to it. That's why i don't trust myself about user friendliness because i have a long experience in computer interfaces. I'm so used to some of them perhaps i can't even imagine that somebody else would like to do it otherwise or doesn't like what i'm used to.\n\nApart from maintaining the museum, what do you work on ? You are still active in the department even though you are retired ? \nI work on sensors, in the internet of things world in one of the university spin-off. What i do for them is sensors wireless need power, and some of them are on batteries. They have designed a complete system which should makes the battery lasts for two, three, four years. They need a system to measure that. So i been working on a mechanism to measure that without waiting four years. That's programming instrumentation computers to mesure power or whatever, that's part Unix systems. There are enough new or unknown things and maybe because i'm older, i have another way of looking at things, so we have a lot of discussions. They don't like my Pearl, they use python, JAVA those things...Pearl, it has it's disavantage, but you could do a lot of thing, each character has a meaning. With Python, you need all those libraries...It's easy when you know the libraries you have to call. When you know the arguments of the librairies...so it's also complicated. ANd if the library change for some reasons, there you go. In my humble opinion it's the same with all the langages. It's starts easy from scratch but if you have to interface them with existing thing from the internet world or whatever it gets complicated.\n\nDo you have a last word ? \nI was surprised by your group reaction to the visit. I thought all of this were known. Maybe i'm getting old :) Curently i don't do much about the museum department, but sometimes i like to talk about the little stories about it. I remember a lot of little stories, a lot of technics who have been used and forgotten and some kept alive. I thought when i was young that the best techniques would succeed.

__NOPUBLISH__\n\n\n**You have been using computers since a long time, as you explained us during the tour we had the joy of assisting during the TGSO.**\n**I heard that that until recently, let's say the late 1990's, when learning computer programming you had to start by  writing down the program on paper... ** \n\nIn 1973, i did study computer sciences, it was the second year of the department, here in Leuven. At the time computers were mainframes and you did fed them with programms by punch cards. Programing was writing down the program, than you punched it and the next day you get results, mostly error. That's the way it worked at that time. To teach us programing, they used the langage of that time, Fortran and some kind of invented assembly langage, it didn't really exist, it was simplified.\n\nMost of the time you did write down your program, the teacher and the assistant would have to tell you what is wrong or good, you didn't had much practical experience.\n\n**How was it like, tons of pages ?** \n\nNo. As an anecdocte, i remember punchcards were a block of papers, we were jealous of the people who came in the computer center with huge stacks of cards. That were really small programs, not complicated one. The fact you had to learn to use the computer from scratch, everything was new, you couldn't rely on previous experiences, everything was new. And to start with small programs was difficult enough. \n\nThat was also the time when Edsger W. Dijkstra, who faught against the goto and other then common but bad constructs (see A Case against the GOTO Statement https://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/EWD/transcriptions/EWD02xx/EWD215.html ). I still remember him, in an audience, giving us a lecture on good  techniques  in programming at the  International computing symposium 1977 in Liège (programming:  from craft to scientific discipline https://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/EWD/transcriptions/EWD05xx/EWD566.html). It was a rather hard course because Dijkstra expected you to quickly  understand and implement his ideas.\n\nAnd then from 75 on, computers became cheaper and could be bought by departments and smaller entities. And than came the first interactive computer. Still beasts about two cubic meters, costing two millions belgian francs. But it was low enough to allow people to type in directly commands. I started working here in 75 as a researcher, it have evolved continuously and i saw computer getting cheaper and getting easier to use.The way to use it was simplified, you could start to go to the beast and try it out.\n\nI remember more or less: you did write down the program in Fortran for instance… We always thought in the beginning that it would work and it didn't, so after a turn around you were giving it back to the operator and you have to wait half a day or a night to get the results.\n\n**What kind of program you were working on?** \n\nI remember the first program i had to write was you got three numbers, you had to make the program decide if you construct a triangle with the numbers being the sides of the triangle.\n\n**That took an afternoon to be processed ?** \n\nWell, yeah. You had to imagine how to do it which was also one problem, than you prepare the card with the punching machine and you give the package of cards to the operator who was feeeding the computer with the cards. People had the taks to fed the computers by hands, with paper, cards, than disks and it lasts onto the magnetic disks period. And after a number of hours or a night you get a listing, a piece of paper, with the results.\n\n**When where you able to record the program onto the machine?**\n\nI think that happens between 75 and 80. After the punching cards which was already a way to record the program, we had  typewriters, terminals but we could record the programs, we could store them on the computer. We had magnetic discs. IBM had number for everything, i remember the 33-30 [manufactured from 1970 on] had a magnetic disk. We didn't touch the machines, operators would change the disks, we could only access the typewriter. That was our most direct connexion to the computer. Thetimes were diffent. The mainframes were such huge costly beasts that it had operators day and night keeping it busy. Even at night there were two or three guys mounting tapes, dismounting tapes, that kind of stuff.\nhttps://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/42/IBM_magnetic_disk_drives_3330%2B3333.png/600px-IBM_magnetic_disk_drives_3330%2B3333.png\n\n**When did you stop working with operators?** \n\nSomewhere between 85 and 90. There were still operators at the main computer of the university, but there were also small computers, so researchers and student can have direct access when needed. \n\n**When did you start to work with software sold by others or gived away in order to do your research?** \n\nYou stil need an operating system on the mainframe that was delivered by IBM or the constructor delivering the mainframe. When you bought mini-computers, which were the  smaller versions of mainframes, in most cases you did buy an operating systems, compilers and all the stuff you need to be able to program those things. In most cases, because the computer sciences department did buy the mini-computer from, for instance *digital equipment corporation*,  a manufactorer of that time, but they didn't buy their software. They were not open source or free,  but you could get Unix and could run it on those digital equipment (DEC) computers. That is what the computer department of the University of Louvain la Neuve *l'unité d'informatique*, did and so did we.\n\n**When did you start working with unix as an os?** \n\nI took a trip to Amsterdam, it must have been in 1979/80… Well, the story starts in our french sister university (LLN) where they did have a PDP-11 with Unix on it. You got Unix, at the time, when you were a university, from Bell Lab (Ma Bell), the american telephone company. It was a mega organisation at the time [before the [dismantlment of AT&T/Bell system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breakup_of_the_Bell_System)].Due to monopoly, the US authorities splitted up in different Baby Bells. One of the restriction was there was a research baby bell, they couldn't really sell anything.There were computer scientists there, who did developped some Unix interesting things.  For universities you did get the source and no support for free. How to install it, no idea. In Unité d'informatique, where they had a PDP-11/70 https://i0.wp.com/www.utterpower.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/pdp11-70-panel.jpg  they were lucky: they got the same computer that unix were developped on.  They got the disk by snail mail as a post-office package. They mounted it and it did spin up and they had it.\nHere, we did have a cheaper PDP11, the PDP 11/60  (https://dave.cheney.net/tag/pdp-11). We got the Unix disk distribution from Bell Labs but we could not run it, because we got another type of disk(RK07). We could look at it but that was all, because our disc format was different than the one at Bell Aps. Somebody here did write a driver for that disk and we did compiled it in l'unité d'informatique of LLN.  it did compile it but we couldn't try it because we did not have So we find the nearest Unix system compatiblewith ours, it was in Amsterdam.  Andrew Tenebaum who did write since then a number of books about operating systems and became quite an authority. He was working there. It was the young Tanenbaum, just arriving from United States to Amsterdam. He was learning to speak dutch. We did understood his english better but his assistant insisted that he speaks dutch because he will have to pass an exam in dutch. There we got a disk, than also the one with the driver we compiled, than we got here and we start using Unix.  Than in my opinion the start of open source was Unix because we had to maintain it by ourselves and we learned a lot from the sources.\nIn that time we did had to get software and it brings us to different places. For example, at the time the agents at the custom at the airport or post didn't know what to do with the discs in terms of custom clearance. They used magnetic or xrays, we had to write on the package that it should not be x-rayed. But we got time to time unreadable discs. \n\n**So it took like weeks between the transportation, the custom...**\nYes, the custom had to clear the packages. I remember i've been in the customs in Zaventem. I had received a letter that my package from Bell Labs had arrived. I went there thinking i would have to pay something and go. But no. It had to be cleared so there wa some organisation that had to do administrative stuff, so i only got it a few days later. The response time was huge :)\n\n**Than after that period of time how did you switch from that kind of collaboration on how to make software and make software work to collaboration on networks, between universities and researchers...**\nIn the Unix system of that time there was a kind of networking protocol which only did work on serial lines.\n You could connect two unix systems together you only need a line. We had one between LLN and Leuven, it's only 15 kms, but we had to ask Belgacom, than La Régie des télégraphes et téléphones, to get a modem to connect through their network and than over that modem you could reach an amazing speed of 300 characters per second. And that was the first communication. It did happened somewhere around 85. And then you had connexion with another computer, writing something here and do  something. And we could send programs to each other. \n \n **What was the first thing you did send through a network like this?**\n I didn't do it myself, i remember it was a kind of chat program. And on LLN side was Elie Milgrom, he is retired now. On this side, it was Pr Willems. And i remember that they typed something and they got a response from the other side and that was it.  But i remember that Pr Willems sent \"ok we stop now\". And that Elie Milgrom answered \"See you later, Alligator\" [a reference to Bill Haley and the Comets].  At the time we still had these kind of songs in mind. (lol). Those Unix to Unix connexions were first. And there was a worldwide Unix to Unix based network, Usenet (1979), it still exists somewhere... you can download load  of illegal movies and that stuff, that was not what we meant at the time. But that is what is left. And Usenet became gradually replaced by the Internet in USA. In Europe, the Internet came a lot later, but we had access to the Internet, we could send mail to them and we could receive mail from them, because some friendly american university, later companies, did translate internet mail to UCP mail. That was before the 1990's.\n \n **Your relation to software had changed at the time because you did not have to do all this manipulations with the software your received... Was it already floppy discs ?**\n No, magnetic tapes, for the mainframe at least. Most of the mini-computers had some cheaper magnetic tapes. Between 90 and 95 the main machines for the software institute was a VAX from DEC. Once a year the software came from Berkeley, it was still Unix but modified by Berkeley for virtual memory and all the stuff which are common now. We received a tape, with lot of goodies, i still remember we didn't know what was on there but we scrutinised there to know what was there, what we can use.\nIn Europe, companies like Siemens were trying to set up software centers to make software avaiable, they were even trying to set up networks. Researchers did love the Internet, it worked, it was useful for their researchs. So companies in Europe, were trying to set up their own networks, i remember for example the X/OPEN transport protocol. Their was a lot of standards about what software layers should do, but it didn't succeed because sometime, 92 maybe, IBM decided to quit their own private network and to go forTCP/IP and was the switching point. Everything done for X/OPEN were suddently forgotten. For the mainframes, and certainly in Belgium computing was mainly mainframes, i'm talking about universities here, so when IBM decided to go for TCP/IP we followed even though things were really slow. For example, Belgacom was not interested in running the Domain Name System so we did it here, for some time, starting in 1993 with Pierre Verbaten (https://www.dnsbelgium.be/en/history). Belgacom were focused on X25 (DCS - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X.25) so they missed it.\n\nIt was like the french Minitel ? \nWell, at that time we were really jealous about Minitel. Could you imagine that? Terminals?  At home ? You could work home with a computer ! You could send emails ! All in one, a pc computer with a modem ! \n\nHow did the research about software evolved in the department?\nI am mainly talking about network research but here there were people working on numerical analysis, computing, artificial intelligence ... I was just not involved in those research so i don't know much about it \n\nYou were focused on software and network..\nYes, we did produce some software. We did make software to generate compilers, there was some A.I. software in Prolog, numerical analysis  libraries... Some were sold or shared, it depends.  \nWe did sell some software since the beginning i think when it was not even a department but a professor and a couple of students.\n\nIs it when you joined ? \nNo it was already a department. I did study dutch industrial engeneering in electronics. At the time in electronics you did hear something about computers, i was interested in it i wanted to know more. I heard they had started a year before a degree in computer engeneering. It was the first year where industrial engineer could join. The only thing we knew about computer were in movies. I wanted to know how it work. I'm not sure i still know now even if maybe i have some ideas...\n\nHow many langage do you know ?\nAssembly, FORTRAN, PL-1 the langage invented by IBM to be the universal one, C, Cobol. Perl, i don't know, so more. I'm not fluent in any other langages, but i can read any langage especially well writtened, i know i can understand it and learn it...I know JAVA also. As a system administrator the thing i use most are the command line of UNIX and Perl. But that's because i'm more familiar with those two so it goes faster.\n\nHow did you see the rise of personnal computer and the software that goes with ? \nI have to admit that we missed it. We didn't see that what was new was powerful. We were not impressed by the software. I remember windows 95, the news on TV, people sleeping on the street to get it. I remember when i get my first windows version, with a box of 22 floppies or so. Then i wanted to do something, to compile a program, but there was no compiler. We were used to Unix, a basic system but with a lot of utilities in it. Software was for us free, and we were used to have it free and it was not free anymore. \n\nDoes that mean you didn't had a personnal computer until late ? \nYes. I think it was round 2000. I didn't needed it really. I got one when the belgian UCP network became commercial. Of course i did not get Windows on it.  I think we got Linux here in 1994. There was a guy involved in the kernel studying here. So we did used it very fast.\n\nSo, what is software for you ?\nFor me software is the magic that make computer usable. I can only gives examples of what i mean by it. A PC without software most people, even computer scientists, can't do anything with it. You need basic software. Some software are already integrated in the computer hardware. Same for phones, tablets... The main characteristic, for me, is that it should be user friendly. That is very difficult i know, because you have to imagine what the people using your software are going to do with it and how they want to use it, that's the magic you need to solve.\n\nIs command line user friendly ? \nWell, somehow you have to learn the command langage that is in fact a computer langage where you can make all the constructs that other langages offers.\nYou can create loops, you can test, whatever. It's not so different from computer langages like C or JAVA or whatever. \n\nBut it's already software no ? User friendly depends on what you put behind these words, no ? \nYes it's already software. I don't have a strong opinion about command lines. It depends on people. I can imagine that someone that have never heard about the command line expect that you click somewhere and it happens. But if you know the command langage it's sometimes perhaps easier or productive to type commands and let it run. Sometimes, i find it easier if i have a screen and a number of buttons and i don't have to imagine what happens behind that screen. And sometimes i want to do something with the command line, because i'm used to it. That's why i don't trust myself about user friendliness because i have a long experience in computer interfaces. I'm so used to some of them perhaps i can't even imagine that somebody else would like to do it otherwise or doesn't like what i'm used to.\n\nApart from maintaining the museum, what do you work on ? You are still active in the department even though you are retired ? \nI work on sensors, in the internet of things world in one of the university spin-off. What i do for them is sensors wireless need power, and some of them are on batteries. They have designed a complete system which should makes the battery lasts for two, three, four years. They need a system to measure that. So i been working on a mechanism to measure that without waiting four years. That's programming instrumentation computers to mesure power or whatever, that's part Unix systems. There are enough new or unknown things and maybe because i'm older, i have another way of looking at things, so we have a lot of discussions. They don't like my Pearl, they use python, JAVA those things...Pearl, it has it's disavantage, but you could do a lot of thing, each character has a meaning. With Python, you need all those libraries...It's easy when you know the libraries you have to call. When you know the arguments of the librairies...so it's also complicated. ANd if the library change for some reasons, there you go. In my humble opinion it's the same with all the langages. It's starts easy from scratch but if you have to interface them with existing thing from the internet world or whatever it gets complicated.\n\nDo you have a last word ? \nI was surprised by your group reaction to the visit. I thought all of this were known. Maybe i'm getting old :) Curently i don't do much about the museum department, but sometimes i like to talk about the little stories about it. I remember a lot of little stories, a lot of technics who have been used and forgotten and some kept alive. I thought when i was young that the best techniques would succeed. That you would have visionnary people who would see the way.

Huens interview extended\n**You have been using computers since a long time, as you explained us during the tour we had the joy of assisting during the TGSO.**\n**I heard that that until recently, let's say the late 1990's, when learning computer programming you had to start by  writing down the program on paper... ** \n\nIn 1973, i did study computer sciences, it was the second year of the departmentComputer ciense course, here in Leuven. At the time computers were mainframes and you did fed them with programms by punch cards. Programing was writing down the program, than you punched it and the next day you get results, mostly error. That's the way it worked at that time. To teach us programing, they used the langage of that time, Fortran and some kind of invented assembly langage, it didn't really exist, it was simplified.\n\nMost of the time you did write down your program, the teacher and the assistant would have to tell you what is wrong or good, you didn't had much practical experience.\n\n**How was it like, tons of pages ?** \n\nNo. As an anecdocte, i remember punchcards were a block of papers, we were jealous of the people who came in the computer center with huge stacks of cards. That were really small programs, not complicated one. The fact you had to learn to use the computer from scratch, everything was new, you couldn't rely on previous experiences, everything was new. And to start with small programs was difficult enough. \n\nThat was also the time when Edsger W. Dijkstra, who faught against the goto and other then common but bad constructs (see A Case against the GOTO Statement https://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/EWD/transcriptions/EWD02xx/EWD215.html ). I still remember him, in an audience, giving us a lecture on good  techniques  in programming at the  International computing symposium 1977 in Liège (programming:  from craft to scientific discipline https://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/EWD/transcriptions/EWD05xx/EWD566.html). It was a rather hard course because Dijkstra expected you to quickly  understand and implement his ideas.\n\nAnd then from 75 on, computers became cheaper and could be bought by departments and smaller entities. And than came the first interactive computer. Still beasts about two cubic meters, costing two millions belgian francs. But it was low enough to allow people to type in directly commands. I started working here in 75 as a researcher, it have evolved continuously and i saw computer getting cheaper and getting easier to use.The way to use it was simplified, you could start to go to the beast and try it out.\n\nI remember more or less: you did write down the program in Fortran for instance… We always thought in the beginning that it would work and it didn't, so after a turn around you were giving it back to the operator and you have to wait half a day or a night to get the results.\n\n**What kind of program you were working on?** \n\nI remember the first program i had to write was you got three numbers, you had to make the program decide if you construct a triangle with the numbers being the sides of the triangle.\n\n**That took an afternoon to be processed ?** \n\nWell, yeah. You had to imagine how to do it which was also one problem, than you prepare the card with the punching machine and you give the package of cards to the operator who was feeeding the computer with the cards. People had the taks to fed the computers by hands, with paper, cards, than disks and it lasts onto the magnetic disks period. And after a number of hours or a night you get a listing, a piece of paper, with the results.\n\n**When where you able to record the program onto the machine?**\n\nI think that happens between 75 and 80. After the punching cards which was already a way to record the program, we had  typewriters, terminals but we could record the programs, we could store them on the computer. We had magnetic discs. IBM had number for everything, i remember the 33-30 [manufactured from 1970 on] had a magnetic disk. We didn't touch the machines, operators would change the disks, we could only access the typewriter. That was our most direct connexion to the computer. Thetimes were diffent. The mainframes were such huge costly beasts that it had operators day and night keeping it busy. Even at night there were two or three guys mounting tapes, dismounting tapes, that kind of stuff.\nhttps://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/42/IBM_magnetic_disk_drives_3330%2B3333.png/600px-IBM_magnetic_disk_drives_3330%2B3333.png\n\n**When did you stop working with operators?** \n\nSomewhere between 85 and 90. There were still operators at the main computer of the university, but there were also small computers, so researchers and student can have direct access when needed. \n\n**When did you start to work with software sold by others or gived away in order to do your research?** \n\nYou stil need an operating system on the mainframe that was delivered by IBM or the constructor delivering the mainframe. When you bought mini-computers, which were the  smaller versions of mainframes, in most cases you did buy an operating systems, compilers and all the stuff you need to be able to program those things. In most cases, because the computer sciences department did buy the mini-computer from, for instance *digital equipment corporation*,  a manufactorer of that time, but they didn't buy their software. They were not open source or free,  but you could get Unix and could run it on those digital equipment (DEC) computers. That is what the computer department of the University of Louvain la Neuve *l'unité d'informatique*, did and so did we.\n\n**When did you start working with unix as an os?** \n\nI took a trip to Amsterdam, it must have been in 1979/80… Well, the story starts in our french sister university (LLN) where they did have a PDP-11 with Unix on it. You got Unix, at the time, when you were a university, from Bell Labs (Ma Bell), the american telephone company. It was a mega organisation at the time [before the [dismantlment of AT&T/Bell system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breakup_of_the_Bell_System)].Due to monopoly, the US authorities splitted up in different Baby Bells. One of the restriction was there was a research baby bell, they couldn't really sell anything.There were computer scientists there, who did developped some Unix interesting things.  For universities you did get the source and no support for free. How to install it, no idea. In Unité d'informatique, where they had a PDP-11/70 https://i0.wp.com/www.utterpower.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/pdp11-70-panel.jpg  they were lucky: they got the same computer that unix were developped on.  They got the disk by snail mail as a post-office package. They mounted it and it did spin up and they had it.\nHere, we did have a cheaper PDP11, the PDP 11/60  (https://dave.cheney.net/tag/pdp-11). We got the Unix disk distribution from Bell Labs but we could not run it, because we got another type of disk(RK07). We could look at it but that was all, because our disc format was different than the one at Bell Labs. Somebody here (P.Verbaeten) did write a driver for that disk in l'unité \nd'informatique of LLN. But they did not have a RK07.  it did compile it but we couldn't try it because we did not have. The nearest place  with Unix and RK07 was in Vrije Universiteit  Amsterdam.  Andrew Tenebaum, who did write a number of books on operating systems, was working there. He was learning to speak dutch. We did understood his english better but his assistant explained that he needed to practice speaking Dutch because he would have to pass an exam. There we compiled Unix with an RK07 driver and stored it on a bootable RK07 disk. With that disk back in Leuven we could start  Unix on our PDP11/60. An error in the process meant a trip Leuven-Amsterdam and back.Than in my opinion the start of open source was Unix because we had to maintain it by ourselves and we learned a lot from the sources. In that time we did had to get software and it brings us to different places. For example, at the time the agents at the custom at the airport or post didn't know what to do with the discs in terms of custom clearance. They used magnetic or xrays, we had to write on the package that it should not be x-rayed. But we got time to time unreadable discs. \n\n**So it took like weeks between the transportation, the custom...**\nYes, the custom had to clear the packages. I remember i've been in the customs in Zaventem. I had received a letter that my package from Bell Labs had arrived. I went there thinking i would have to pay something and go. But no. It had to be cleared so there wa some organisation that had to do administrative stuff, so i only got it a few days later. The response time was huge :)\n\n**Than after that period of time how did you switch from that kind of collaboration on how to make software and make software work to collaboration on networks, between universities and researchers...**\nIn the Unix system of that time there was a kind of networking protocol which only did work on serial lines.\n You could connect two unix systems together you only need a line. We had one between LLN and Leuven, it's only 15 kms, but we had to ask Belgacom, than La Régie des télégraphes et téléphones, to get a modem to connect through their network and than over that modem you could reach an amazing speed of 300 characters per second. And that was the first communication. It did happened somewhere around 85. And then you had connexion with another computer, writing something here and do  something. And we could send programs to each other. \n \n **What was the first thing you did send through a network like this?**\n I didn't do it myself, i remember it was a kind of chat program. And on LLN side was Elie Milgrom, he is retired now. On this side, it was Pr Willems. And i remember that they typed something and they got a response from the other side and that was it.  But i remember that Pr Willems sent \"ok we stop now\". And that Elie Milgrom answered \"See you later, Alligator\" [a reference to Bill Haley and the Comets].  At the time we still had these kind of songs in mind. (lol). Those Unix to Unix connexions were first. And there was a worldwide Unix to Unix based network, Usenet (1979), it still exists somewhere... you can download load  of illegal movies and that stuff, that was not what we meant at the time. But that is what is left. And Usenet became gradually replaced by the Internet in USA. In Europe, the Internet came a lot later, but we had access to the Internet, we could send mail to them and we could receive mail from them, because some friendly american university, later companies, did translate internet mail to UCP mail. That was before the 1990's.\n \n **Your relation to software had changed at the time because you did not have to do all this manipulations with the software your received... Was it already floppy discs ?**\n No, magnetic tapes, for the mainframe at least. Most of the mini-computers had some cheaper magnetic tapes. Between 90 and 95 the main machines for the software institute was a VAX from DEC. Once a year the software came from Berkeley, it was still Unix but modified by Berkeley for virtual memory and all the stuff which are common now. We received a tape, with lot of goodies, i still remember we didn't know what was on there but we scrutinised there to know what was there, what we can use.\nIn Europe, companies like Siemens were trying to set up software centers to make software avaiable, they were even trying to set up networks. Researchers did love the Internet, it worked, it was useful for their researchs. So companies in Europe, were trying to set up their own networks, i remember for example the X/OPEN transport protocol. Their was a lot of standards about what software layers should do, but it didn't succeed because sometime, 92 maybe, IBM decided to quit their own private network and to go forTCP/IP and was the switching point. Everything done for X/OPEN were suddently forgotten. For the mainframes, and certainly in Belgium computing was mainly mainframes, i'm talking about universities here, so when IBM decided to go for TCP/IP we followed even though things were really slow. For example, Belgacom was not interested in running the Domain Name System so we did it here, for some time, starting in 1993 with Pierre Verbaten (https://www.dnsbelgium.be/en/history). Belgacom were focused on X25 (DCS - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X.25) so they missed it.\n\nIt was like the french Minitel ? \nWell, at that time we were really jealous about Minitel. Could you imagine that? Terminals?  At home ? You could work home with a computer ! You could send emails ! All in one, a pc computer with a modem ! \n\nHow did the research about software evolved in the department?\nI am mainly talking about network research but here there were people working on numerical analysis, computing, artificial intelligence ... I was just not involved in those research so i don't know much about it \n\nYou were focused on software and network..\nYes, we did produce some software. We did make software to generate compilers, there was some A.I. software in Prolog, numerical analysis  libraries... Some were sold or shared, it depends.  \nWe did sell some software since the beginning i think when it was not even a department but a professor and a couple of students.\n\nIs it when you joined ? \nNo it was already a department. I did study dutch industrial engeneering in electronics. At the time in electronics you did hear something about computers, i was interested in it i wanted to know more. I heard they had started a year before a degree in computer engeneering. It was the first year where industrial engineer could join. The only thing we knew about computer were in movies. I wanted to know how it work. I'm not sure i still know now even if maybe i have some ideas...\n\nHow many langage do you know ?\nAssembly, FORTRAN, PL-1 the langage invented by IBM to be the universal one, C, Cobol. Perl, i don't know, so more. I'm not fluent in any other langages, but i can read any langage especially well writtened, i know i can understand it and learn it...I know JAVA also. As a system administrator the thing i use most are the command line of UNIX and Perl. But that's because i'm more familiar with those two so it goes faster.\n\nHow did you see the rise of personnal computer and the software that goes with ? \nI have to admit that we missed it. We didn't see that what was new was powerful. We were not impressed by the software. I remember windows 95, the news on TV, people sleeping on the street to get it. I remember when i get my first windows version, with a box of 22 floppies or so. Then i wanted to do something, to compile a program, but there was no compiler. We were used to Unix, a basic system but with a lot of utilities in it. Software was for us free, and we were used to have it free and it was not free anymore. \n\nDoes that mean you didn't had a personnal computer until late ? \nYes. I think it was round 2000. I didn't needed it really. I got one when the belgian UCP network became commercial. Of course i did not get Windows on it.  I think we got Linux here in 1994. There was a guy involved in the kernel studying here. So we did used it very fast.\n\nSo, what is software for you ?\nFor me software is the magic that make computer usable. I can only gives examples of what i mean by it. A PC without software most people, even computer scientists, can't do anything with it. You need basic software. Some software are already integrated in the computer hardware. Same for phones, tablets... The main characteristic, for me, is that it should be user friendly. That is very difficult i know, because you have to imagine what the people using your software are going to do with it and how they want to use it, that's the magic you need to solve.\n\nIs command line user friendly ? \nWell, somehow you have to learn the command langage that is in fact a computer langage where you can make all the constructs that other langages offers.\nYou can create loops, you can test, whatever. It's not so different from computer langages like C or JAVA or whatever. \n\nBut it's already software no ? User friendly depends on what you put behind these words, no ? \nYes it's already software. I don't have a strong opinion about command lines. It depends on people. I can imagine that someone that have never heard about the command line expect that you click somewhere and it happens. But if you know the command langage it's sometimes perhaps easier or productive to type commands and let it run. Sometimes, i find it easier if i have a screen and a number of buttons and i don't have to imagine what happens behind that screen. And sometimes i want to do something with the command line, because i'm used to it. That's why i don't trust myself about user friendliness because i have a long experience in computer interfaces. I'm so used to some of them perhaps i can't even imagine that somebody else would like to do it otherwise or doesn't like what i'm used to.\n\nApart from maintaining the museum, what do you work on ? You are still active in the department even though you are retired ? \nI work on sensors, in the internet of things world in one of the university spin-off. What i do for them is sensors wireless need power, and some of them are on batteries. They have designed a complete system which should makes the battery lasts for two, three, four years. They need a system to measure that. So i been working on a mechanism to measure that without waiting four years. That's programming instrumentation computers to mesure power or whatever, that's part Unix systems. There are enough new or unknown things and maybe because i'm older, i have another way of looking at things, so we have a lot of discussions. They don't like my Pearl, they use python, JAVA those things...Pearl, it has it's disavantage, but you could do a lot of thing, each character has a meaning. With Python, you need all those libraries...It's easy when you know the libraries you have to call. When you know the arguments of the librairies...so it's also complicated. ANd if the library change for some reasons, there you go. In my humble opinion it's the same with all the langages. It's starts easy from scratch but if you have to interface them with existing thing from the internet world or whatever it gets complicated.\n\nDo you have a last word ? \nI was surprised by your group reaction to the visit. I thought all of this were known. Maybe i'm getting old :) Curently i don't do much about the museum department, but sometimes i like to talk about the little stories about it. I remember a lot of little stories, a lot of technics who have been used and forgotten and some kept alive. I thought when i was young that the best techniques would succeed.

Huens interview extended\n**You have been using computers since a long time, as you explained us during the tour we had the joy of assisting during the TGSO.**\n**I heard that that until recently, let's say the late 1990's, when learning computer programming you had to start by  writing down the program on paper... ** \n\nIn 1973, i did study computer sciences, it was the second year of the departmentComputer Sciense course, here in Leuven. At the time computers were mainframes and you did fed them with programms by punch cards. Programing was writing down the program, then you punched it and the next day you get results, mostly error. That's the way it worked at that time. To teach us programing, they used the langage of that time, Fortran and some kind of invented assembly langage, it didn't really exist, it was simplified.\n\nMost of the time you did write down your program, the teacher and the assistant would have to tell you what is wrong or good, you didn't had much practical experience.\n\n**How was it like, tons of pages ?** \n\nNo. As an anecdocte, i remember punchcards were a block of papers, we were jealous of the people who came in the computer center with huge stacks of cards. That were really small programs, not complicated one. In fact you had to learn to use the computer from scratch, everything was new, you couldn't rely on previous experiences, everything was new. And to start with small programs was difficult enough. \n\nThat was also the time when Edsger W. Dijkstra, who faught against the goto and other then common but bad constructs (see A Case against the GOTO Statement https://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/EWD/transcriptions/EWD02xx/EWD215.html ). I still remember him, in an audience, giving us a lecture on good  techniques  in programming at the  International computing symposium 1977 in Liège (programming:  from craft to scientific discipline https://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/EWD/transcriptions/EWD05xx/EWD566.html). It was a rather hard course because Dijkstra expected you to quickly  understand and implement his ideas.\n\nAnd then from 75 on, computers became cheaper and could be bought by departments and smaller entities. And than came the first interactive computer. Still beasts about two cubic meters, costing two millions belgian francs. But it was low enough to allow people to type in directly commands. I started working here in 75 as a researcher, it has evolved continuously and i saw computers getting cheaper and getting easier to use.The way to use it was simplified, you could start to go to the beast and try it out.\n\nI remember more or less: you did write down the program in Fortran for instance… We always thought in the beginning that it would work and it didn't, so after a turn around you were giving it back to the operator and you have to wait another half a day or a night to get the results.\n\n**What kind of program you were working on?** \n\nI remember the first program i had to write was: you got three numbers, you had to make the program decide if you could construct a triangle with the numbers being the sides of the triangle.\n\n**That took an afternoon to be processed ?** \n\nWell, yeah. You had to imagine how to do it which was also one problem, than you prepare the cards with the punching machine and you give the package of cards to the operator who was feeeding the computer with the cards. Operator people had the taks to feed the computers by hands, with paper, cards, then cards got written on disks and processed by the mainframe. Finally results g it lasts onto the magnetic disks period. And after a number of hours or a night you get a listing, a piece of paper, with the results.\n\n**When where you able to record the program onto the machine?**\n\nI think that happens between 75 and 80. After the punching cards which was already a way to record the program, we had  typewriters, terminals but we could record the programs, we could store them on the computer. We had magnetic discs. IBM had number for everything, i remember the 33-30 [manufactured from 1970 on] had a magnetic disk. We didn't touch the machines, operators would change the disks, we could only access the typewriter. That was our most direct connexion to the computer. Thetimes were diffent. The mainframes were such huge costly beasts that it had operators day and night keeping it busy. Even at night there were two or three guys mounting tapes, dismounting tapes, that kind of stuff.\nhttps://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/42/IBM_magnetic_disk_drives_3330%2B3333.png/600px-IBM_magnetic_disk_drives_3330%2B3333.png\n\n**When did you stop working with operators?** \n\nSomewhere between 85 and 90. There were still operators at the main computer of the university, but there were also small computers, so researchers and student can have direct access when needed. \n\n**When did you start to work with software sold by others or gived away in order to do your research?** \n\nYou stil need an operating system on the mainframe that was delivered by IBM or the constructor delivering the mainframe. When you bought mini-computers, which were the  smaller versions of mainframes, in most cases you did buy an operating systems, compilers and all the stuff you need to be able to program those things. In most cases, because the computer sciences department did buy the mini-computer from, for instance *digital equipment corporation*,  a manufactorer of that time, but they didn't buy their software. They were not open source or free,  but you could get Unix and could run it on those digital equipment (DEC) computers. That is what the computer department of the University of Louvain la Neuve *l'unité d'informatique*, did and so did we.\n\n**When did you start working with unix as an os?** \n\nI took a trip to Amsterdam, it must have been in 1979/80… Well, the story starts in our french sister university (LLN) where they did have a PDP-11 with Unix on it. You got Unix, at the time, when you were a university, from Bell Labs (Ma Bell), the american telephone company. It was a mega organisation at the time [before the [dismantlment of AT&T/Bell system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breakup_of_the_Bell_System)].Due to monopoly, the US authorities splitted up in different Baby Bells. One of the restriction was there was a research baby bell, they couldn't really sell anything.There were computer scientists there, who did developped some Unix interesting things.  For universities you did get the source and no support for free. How to install it, no idea. In Unité d'informatique, where they had a PDP-11/70 https://i0.wp.com/www.utterpower.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/pdp11-70-panel.jpg  they were lucky: they got the same computer that unix were developped on.  They got the disk by snail mail as a post-office package. They mounted it and it did spin up and they had it.\nHere, we did have a cheaper PDP11, the PDP 11/60  (https://dave.cheney.net/tag/pdp-11). We got the Unix disk distribution from Bell Labs but we could not run it, because we got another type of disk(RK07). We could look at it but that was all, because our disc format was different than the one at Bell Labs. Somebody here (P.Verbaeten) did write a driver for that disk in l'unité \nd'informatique of LLN. But they did not have a RK07.  it did compile it but we couldn't try it because we did not have. The nearest place  with Unix and RK07 was in Vrije Universiteit  Amsterdam.  Andrew Tenebaum, who did write a number of books on operating systems, was working there. He was learning to speak dutch. We did understood his english better but his assistant explained that he needed to practice speaking Dutch because he would have to pass an exam. There we compiled Unix with an RK07 driver and stored it on a bootable RK07 disk. With that disk back in Leuven we could start  Unix on our PDP11/60. An error in the process meant a trip Leuven-Amsterdam and back.Than in my opinion the start of open source was Unix because we had to maintain it by ourselves and we learned a lot from the sources. In that time we did had to get software and it brings us to different places. For example, at the time the agents at the custom at the airport or post didn't know what to do with the discs in terms of custom clearance. They used magnetic or xrays, we had to write on the package that it should not be x-rayed. But we got time to time unreadable discs. \n\n**So it took like weeks between the transportation, the custom...**\nYes, the custom had to clear the packages. I remember i've been in the customs in Zaventem. I had received a letter that my package from Bell Labs had arrived. I went there thinking i would have to pay something and go. But no. It had to be cleared so there wa some organisation that had to do administrative stuff, so i only got it a few days later. The response time was huge :)\n\n**Than after that period of time how did you switch from that kind of collaboration on how to make software and make software work to collaboration on networks, between universities and researchers...**\nIn the Unix system of that time there was a kind of networking protocol which only did work on serial lines.\n You could connect two unix systems together you only need a line. We had one between LLN and Leuven, it's only 15 kms, but we had to ask Belgacom, than La Régie des télégraphes et téléphones, to get a modem to connect through their network and than over that modem you could reach an amazing speed of 300 characters per second. And that was the first communication. It did happened somewhere around 85. And then you had connexion with another computer, writing something here and do  something. And we could send programs to each other. \n \n **What was the first thing you did send through a network like this?**\n I didn't do it myself, i remember it was a kind of chat program. And on LLN side was Elie Milgrom, he is retired now. On this side, it was Pr Willems. And i remember that they typed something and they got a response from the other side and that was it.  But i remember that Pr Willems sent \"ok we stop now\". And that Elie Milgrom answered \"See you later, Alligator\" [a reference to Bill Haley and the Comets].  At the time we still had these kind of songs in mind. (lol). Those Unix to Unix connexions were first. And there was a worldwide Unix to Unix based network, Usenet (1979), it still exists somewhere... you can download load  of illegal movies and that stuff, that was not what we meant at the time. But that is what is left. And Usenet became gradually replaced by the Internet in USA. In Europe, the Internet came a lot later, but we had access to the Internet, we could send mail to them and we could receive mail from them, because some friendly american university, later companies, did translate internet mail to UCP mail. That was before the 1990's.\n \n **Your relation to software had changed at the time because you did not have to do all this manipulations with the software your received... Was it already floppy discs ?**\n No, magnetic tapes, for the mainframe at least. Most of the mini-computers had some cheaper magnetic tapes. Between 90 and 95 the main machines for the software institute was a VAX from DEC. Once a year the software came from Berkeley, it was still Unix but modified by Berkeley for virtual memory and all the stuff which are common now. We received a tape, with lot of goodies, i still remember we didn't know what was on there but we scrutinised there to know what was there, what we can use.\nIn Europe, companies like Siemens were trying to set up software centers to make software avaiable, they were even trying to set up networks. Researchers did love the Internet, it worked, it was useful for their researchs. So companies in Europe, were trying to set up their own networks, i remember for example the X/OPEN transport protocol. Their was a lot of standards about what software layers should do, but it didn't succeed because sometime, 92 maybe, IBM decided to quit their own private network and to go forTCP/IP and was the switching point. Everything done for X/OPEN were suddently forgotten. For the mainframes, and certainly in Belgium computing was mainly mainframes, i'm talking about universities here, so when IBM decided to go for TCP/IP we followed even though things were really slow. For example, Belgacom was not interested in running the Domain Name System so we did it here, for some time, starting in 1993 with Pierre Verbaten (https://www.dnsbelgium.be/en/history). Belgacom were focused on X25 (DCS - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X.25) so they missed it.\n\nIt was like the french Minitel ? \nWell, at that time we were really jealous about Minitel. Could you imagine that? Terminals?  At home ? You could work home with a computer ! You could send emails ! All in one, a pc computer with a modem ! \n\nHow did the research about software evolved in the department?\nI am mainly talking about network research but here there were people working on numerical analysis, computing, artificial intelligence ... I was just not involved in those research so i don't know much about it \n\nYou were focused on software and network..\nYes, we did produce some software. We did make software to generate compilers, there was some A.I. software in Prolog, numerical analysis  libraries... Some were sold or shared, it depends.  \nWe did sell some software since the beginning i think when it was not even a department but a professor and a couple of students.\n\nIs it when you joined ? \nNo it was already a department. I did study dutch industrial engeneering in electronics. At the time in electronics you did hear something about computers, i was interested in it i wanted to know more. I heard they had started a year before a degree in computer engeneering. It was the first year where industrial engineer could join. The only thing we knew about computer were in movies. I wanted to know how it work. I'm not sure i still know now even if maybe i have some ideas...\n\nHow many langage do you know ?\nAssembly, FORTRAN, PL-1 the langage invented by IBM to be the universal one, C, Cobol. Perl, i don't know, so more. I'm not fluent in any other langages, but i can read any langage especially well writtened, i know i can understand it and learn it...I know JAVA also. As a system administrator the thing i use most are the command line of UNIX and Perl. But that's because i'm more familiar with those two so it goes faster.\n\nHow did you see the rise of personnal computer and the software that goes with ? \nI have to admit that we missed it. We didn't see that what was new was powerful. We were not impressed by the software. I remember windows 95, the news on TV, people sleeping on the street to get it. I remember when i get my first windows version, with a box of 22 floppies or so. Then i wanted to do something, to compile a program, but there was no compiler. We were used to Unix, a basic system but with a lot of utilities in it. Software was for us free, and we were used to have it free and it was not free anymore. \n\nDoes that mean you didn't had a personnal computer until late ? \nYes. I think it was round 2000. I didn't needed it really. I got one when the belgian UCP network became commercial. Of course i did not get Windows on it.  I think we got Linux here in 1994. There was a guy involved in the kernel studying here. So we did used it very fast.\n\nSo, what is software for you ?\nFor me software is the magic that make computer usable. I can only gives examples of what i mean by it. A PC without software most people, even computer scientists, can't do anything with it. You need basic software. Some software are already integrated in the computer hardware. Same for phones, tablets... The main characteristic, for me, is that it should be user friendly. That is very difficult i know, because you have to imagine what the people using your software are going to do with it and how they want to use it, that's the magic you need to solve.\n\nIs command line user friendly ? \nWell, somehow you have to learn the command langage that is in fact a computer langage where you can make all the constructs that other langages offers.\nYou can create loops, you can test, whatever. It's not so different from computer langages like C or JAVA or whatever. \n\nBut it's already software no ? User friendly depends on what you put behind these words, no ? \nYes it's already software. I don't have a strong opinion about command lines. It depends on people. I can imagine that someone that have never heard about the command line expect that you click somewhere and it happens. But if you know the command langage it's sometimes perhaps easier or productive to type commands and let it run. Sometimes, i find it easier if i have a screen and a number of buttons and i don't have to imagine what happens behind that screen. And sometimes i want to do something with the command line, because i'm used to it. That's why i don't trust myself about user friendliness because i have a long experience in computer interfaces. I'm so used to some of them perhaps i can't even imagine that somebody else would like to do it otherwise or doesn't like what i'm used to.\n\nApart from maintaining the museum, what do you work on ? You are still active in the department even though you are retired ? \nI work on sensors, in the internet of things world in one of the university spin-off. What i do for them is sensors wireless need power, and some of them are on batteries. They have designed a complete system which should makes the battery lasts for two, three, four years. They need a system to measure that. So i been working on a mechanism to measure that without waiting four years. That's programming instrumentation computers to mesure power or whatever, that's part Unix systems. There are enough new or unknown things and maybe because i'm older, i have another way of looking at things, so we have a lot of discussions. They don't like my Pearl, they use python, JAVA those things...Pearl, it has it's disavantage, but you could do a lot of thing, each character has a meaning. With Python, you need all those libraries...It's easy when you know the libraries you have to call. When you know the arguments of the librairies...so it's also complicated. ANd if the library change for some reasons, there you go. In my humble opinion it's the same with all the langages. It's starts easy from scratch but if you have to interface them with existing thing from the internet world or whatever it gets complicated.\n\nDo you have a last word ? \nI was surprised by your group reaction to the visit. I thought all of this were known. Maybe i'm getting old :) Curently i don't do much about the museum department, but sometimes i like to talk about the little stories about it. I remember a lot of little stories, a lot of technics who have been used and forgotten and some kept alive. I thought when i was young that the best techniques would succeed.

__NOPUBLISH__\n\n\n**You have been using computers since a long time, as you explained us during the tour we had the joy of assisting during the TGSO.**\n**I heard that that until recently, let's say the late 1990's, when learning computer programming you had to start by  writing down the program on paper... ** \n\nIn 1973, i did study computer sciences, it was the second year of the department, here in Leuven. At the time computers were mainframes and you did fed them with programms by punch cards. Programing was writing down the program, than you punched it and the next day you get results, mostly error. That's the way it worked at that time. To teach us programing, they used the langage of that time, Fortran and some kind of invented assembly langage, it didn't really exist, it was simplified.\n\nMost of the time you did write down your program, the teacher and the assistant would have to tell you what is wrong or good, you didn't had much practical experience.\n\n**How was it like, tons of pages ?** \n\nNo. As an anecdocte, i remember punchcards were a block of papers, we were jealous of the people who came in the computer center with huge stacks of cards. That were really small programs, not complicated one. The fact you had to learn to use the computer from scratch, everything was new, you couldn't rely on previous experiences, everything was new. And to start with small programs was difficult enough. \n\nThat was also the time when Edsger W. Dijkstra who forked the goto... i still remember him, in an audience, giving us a lecture on modernisation in programming at the International computing symposium 1977 in Liège (programming: from craft to scientific discipline https://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/EWD/transcriptions/EWD05xx/EWD566.html). He told usxx (i'll complete it as soon as possible. i need Jean's input)\"\n\nAnd then from 75 on, computers became cheaper and could be bought by departments and smaller entities. And than came the first interactive computer. Still beasts about two cubic meters, costing two millions belgian francs. But it was low enough to allow people to type in directly commands. I started working here in 75 as a researcher, it have evolved continuously and i saw computer getting cheaper and getting easier to use.The way to use it was simplified, you could start to go to the beast and try it out.\n\nI remember more or less: you did write down the program in Fortran for instance… We always thought in the beginning that it would work and it didn't, so after a turn around you were giving it back to the operator and you have to wait half a day or a night to get the results.\n\n**What kind of program you were working on?** \n\nI remember the first program i had to write was you got three numbers, you had to make the program decide if you construct a triangle with the numbers being the sides of the triangle.\n\n**That took an afternoon to be processed ?** \n\nWell, yeah. You had to imagine how to do it which was also one problem, than you prepare the card with the punching machine and you give the package of cards to the operator who was feeeding the computer with the cards. People had the taks to fed the computers by hands, with paper, cards, than disks and it lasts onto the magnetic disks period. And after a number of hours or a night you get a listing, a piece of paper, with the results.\n\n**When where you able to record the program onto the machine?**\n\nI think that happens between 75 and 80. After the punching cards which was already a way to record the program, we had  typewriters, terminals but we could record the programs, we could store them on the computer. We had magnetic discs. IBM had number for everything, i remember the 33-30 [manufactured from 1970 on] had a magnetic disk. We didn't touch the machines, operators would change the disks, we could only access the typewriter. That was our most direct connexion to the computer. Thetimes were diffent. The mainframes were such huge costly beasts that it had operators day and night keeping it busy. Even at night there were two or three guys mounting tapes, dismounting tapes, that kind of stuff.\nhttps://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/42/IBM_magnetic_disk_drives_3330%2B3333.png/600px-IBM_magnetic_disk_drives_3330%2B3333.png\n\n**When did you stop working with operators?** \n\nSomewhere between 85 and 90. There were still operators at the main computer of the university, but there were also small computers, so researchers and student can have direct access when needed. \n\n**When did you start to work with software sold by others or gived away in order to do your research?** \n\nYou stil need an operating system on the mainframe that was delivered by IBM or the constructor delivering the mainframe. When you bought mini-computers, which were the  smaller versions of mainframes, in most cases you did buy an operating systems, compilers and all the stuff you need to be able to program those things. In most cases, because the computer sciences department did buy the mini-computer from, for instance *digital equipment corporation*,  a manufactorer of that time, but they didn't buy their software. They were not open source or free,  but you could get Unix and could run it on those digital equipment (DEC) computers. That is what the computer department of the University of Louvain la Neuve *l'unité d'informatique*, did and so did we.\n\n**When did you start working with unix as an os?** \n\nI took a trip to Amsterdam, it must have been in 1979/80… Well, the story starts in our french sister university (LLN) where they did have a PDP-11 with Unix on it https://hackadaycom.files.wordpress.com/2016/08/full-size-pdp11.jpg. You got Unix, at the time, when you were a university, from Bell Aps (Ma Bell), the american telephone company. It was a mega organisation at the time [before the [dismantlment of AT&T/Bell system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breakup_of_the_Bell_System)].Due to monopoly, the US authorities splitted up in different Baby Bells. One of the restriction was there was a research baby bell, they couldn't really sell anything.There were computer scientists there, who did developped some Unix interesting things.  For universities you did get the source and no support for free. How to install it, no idea. In Unité d'informatique, they were lucky: they got the same computer that unix were developped on.  They got the disk by snail mail as a post-office package. They mounted it and it did spin up and they had it.\nHere, we did have a cheaper PDP11 (DEC - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PDP-11) We go the disk source from Be but we could not run it. Somebody here did write a driver for that disk in l'unité d'informatique of LLN.  The nearest place was in Amsterdam.  Andrew Tenebaum who did write a number of books on operating systems was working there. It was the young Tanenbaum, just arriving from United States to Amsterdam. He was learning to speak dutch. We did understood his english better but his assistant insisted that he speaks dutch because he will have to pass an exam in dutch.\nWe got a disk with, that disk we got here and we start using Unix.\n\n\n\n\n\n","attribs":"|1+g*6|2+2*5+3p*6|1+1*5+4f*6|2+2+dm*6|2+2+4n*6|1+1|1+1*5+11*6|2+2+bc*6|2+2+5z*2+3e*3+1*4*3+20*4+1*6|2+2+e7*6|2+2+7n*6|2+2*5+1a*6|2+2+53*6|2+2*5+19*6|2+2+c7*6|2+2*5+1r*6|2+2+jo*6|1+1+41*6|2+2*5+1a*6|2+2+5g*6|2+2*5+2w*6|2+2+l6*6|2+2*5+1f*6|2+2+8f*5+7+50*0+z+2p*0+5+9*0+7+o*0+1+r*0+8+1c*0+3+19*0+9+k*0+1+9*0+1a+32*0+1h*6|1+1*2+2l*0*2+f*2+d3*6|1+1*2+1u*6|5+5|1+1"}}},"pad:observatory.guide.jeanhuensitvextended:revs:8000":{"changeset":"Z:esr>1|t=2xf=5q*d+1$o","meta":{"author":"a.T2VW9Z1FoOo412v8","timestamp":1518186103858,"atext":{"text":"\n*Jean Huens interview extended\n**You have been using computers since a long time, as you explained us during the tour we had the joy of assisting during the TGSO.**\n**I heard that that until recently, let's say the late 1990's, when learning computer programming you had to start by  writing down the program on paper... ** \n\nIn 1973, i did study computer sciences, it was the second year of the Computer Sciense course, here in Leuven.

You got Unix, at the time, when you were a university, from Bell Labs (Ma Bell), the american telephone company. It was a mega organisation at the time [before the [dismantlment of AT&T/Bell system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breakup_of_the_Bell_System)].Due to monopoly, the US authorities splitted up in different Baby Bells. One of the restriction was there was a research baby bell, they couldn't really sell anything.There were computer scientists there, who did developped some Unix interesting things.  For universities you did get the source and no support for free. How to install it, no idea. In Unité d'informatique, where they had a PDP-11/70 https://i0.wp.com/www.utterpower.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/pdp11-70-panel.jpg  they were lucky: they got the same computer that unix were developped on.  They got the disk by snail mail as a post-office package. They mounted it and it did spin up and they had it.\nHere, we did have a cheaper PDP11, the PDP 11/60  (https://dave.cheney.net/tag/pdp-11). We got the Unix disk distribution from Bell Labs but we could not run it, because we got another type of disk(RK07). We could look at it but that was all, because our disc format was different than the one at Bell Labs. Somebody here (P.Verbaeten) did write a driver for that disk in l'unité \nd'informatique of LLN. But they did not have a RK07.  it did compile it but we couldn't try it because we did not have. The nearest place  with Unix and RK07 was in Vrije Universiteit  Amsterdam.  Andrew Tenebaum, who did write a number of books on operating systems, was working there. He was learning to speak dutch. We did understood his english better but his assistant explained that he needed to practice speaking Dutch because he would have to pass an exam. There we compiled Unix with an RK07 driver and stored it on a bootable RK07 disk. With that disk back in Leuven we could start  Unix on our PDP11/60. An error in the process meant a trip Leuven-Amsterdam and back.Than in my opinion the start of open source was Unix because we had to maintain it by ourselves and we learned a lot from the sources. In that time we did had to get software and it brings us to different places. For example, at the time the agents at the custom at the airport or post didn't know what to do with the discs in terms of custom clearance. They used magnetic or xrays, we had to write on the package that it should not be x-rayed. But we got time to time unreadable discs. \n\n**So it took like weeks between the transportation, the custom...**\nYes, the custom had to clear the packages. I remember i've been in the customs in Zaventem. I had received a letter that my package from Bell Labs had arrived. I went there thinking i would have to pay something and go. But no. It had to be cleared so there wa some organisation that had to do administrative stuff, so i only got it a few days later. The response time was huge :)\n\n**Than after that period of time how did you switch from that kind of collaboration on how to make software and make software work to collaboration on networks, between universities and researchers...**\nIn the Unix system of that time there was a kind of networking protocol which only did work on serial lines.\n You could connect two unix systems together you only need a line. We had one between LLN and Leuven, it's only 15 kms, but we had to ask Belgacom, than La Régie des télégraphes et téléphones, to get a modem to connect through their network and than over that modem you could reach an amazing speed of 300 characters per second. And that was the first communication. It did happened somewhere around 85. And then you had connexion with another computer, writing something here and do  something. And we could send programs to each other. \n \n **What was the first thing you did send through a network like this?**\n I didn't do it myself, i remember it was a kind of chat program. And on LLN side was Elie Milgrom, he is retired now. On this side, it was Pr Willems. And i remember that they typed something and they got a response from the other side and that was it.  But i remember that Pr Willems sent \"ok we stop now\". And that Elie Milgrom answered \"See you later, Alligator\" [a reference to Bill Haley and the Comets].  At the time we still had these kind of songs in mind. (lol). Those Unix to Unix connexions were first. And there was a worldwide Unix to Unix based network, Usenet (1979), it still exists somewhere... you can download load  of illegal movies and that stuff, that was not what we meant at the time. But that is what is left. And Usenet became gradually replaced by the Internet in USA. In Europe, the Internet came a lot later, but we had access to the Internet, we could send mail to them and we could receive mail from them, because some friendly american university, later companies, did translate internet mail to UCP mail. That was before the 1990's.\n \n **Your relation to software had changed at the time because you did not have to do all this manipulations with the software your received... Was it already floppy discs ?**\n No, magnetic tapes, for the mainframe at least. Most of the mini-computers had some cheaper magnetic tapes. Between 90 and 95 the main machines for the software institute was a VAX from DEC. Once a year the software came from Berkeley, it was still Unix but modified by Berkeley for virtual memory and all the stuff which are common now. We received a tape, with lot of goodies, i still remember we didn't know what was on there but we scrutinised there to know what was there, what we can use.\nIn Europe, companies like Siemens were trying to set up software centers to make software avaiable, they were even trying to set up networks. Researchers did love the Internet, it worked, it was useful for their researchs. So companies in Europe, were trying to set up their own networks, i remember for example the X/OPEN transport protocol. Their was a lot of standards about what software layers should do, but it didn't succeed because sometime, 92 maybe, IBM decided to quit their own private network and to go forTCP/IP and was the switching point. Everything done for X/OPEN were suddently forgotten. For the mainframes, and certainly in Belgium computing was mainly mainframes, i'm talking about universities here, so when IBM decided to go for TCP/IP we followed even though things were really slow. For example, Belgacom was not interested in running the Domain Name System so we did it here, for some time, starting in 1993 with Pierre Verbaten (https://www.dnsbelgium.be/en/history). Belgacom were focused on X25 (DCS - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X.25) so they missed it.\n\nIt was like the french Minitel ? \nWell, at that time we were really jealous about Minitel. Could you imagine that? Terminals?  At home ? You could work home with a computer ! You could send emails ! All in one, a pc computer with a modem ! \n\nHow did the research about software evolved in the department?\nI am mainly talking about network research but here there were people working on numerical analysis, computing, artificial intelligence ... I was just not involved in those research so i don't know much about it \n\nYou were focused on software and network..\nYes, we did produce some software. We did make software to generate compilers, there was some A.I. software in Prolog, numerical analysis  libraries... Some were sold or shared, it depends.  \nWe did sell some software since the beginning i think when it was not even a department but a professor and a couple of students.\n\nIs it when you joined ? \nNo it was already a department. I did study dutch industrial engeneering in electronics. At the time in electronics you did hear something about computers, i was interested in it i wanted to know more. I heard they had started a year before a degree in computer engeneering. It was the first year where industrial engineer could join. The only thing we knew about computer were in movies. I wanted to know how it work. I'm not sure i still know now even if maybe i have some ideas...\n\nHow many langage do you know ?\nAssembly, FORTRAN, PL-1 the langage invented by IBM to be the universal one, C, Cobol. Perl, i don't know, so more. I'm not fluent in any other langages, but i can read any langage especially well writtened, i know i can understand it and learn it...I know JAVA also. As a system administrator the thing i use most are the command line of UNIX and Perl. But that's because i'm more familiar with those two so it goes faster.\n\nHow did you see the rise of personnal computer and the software that goes with ? \nI have to admit that we missed it. We didn't see that what was new was powerful. We were not impressed by the software. I remember windows 95, the news on TV, people sleeping on the street to get it. I remember when i get my first windows version, with a box of 22 floppies or so. Then i wanted to do something, to compile a program, but there was no compiler. We were used to Unix, a basic system but with a lot of utilities in it. Software was for us free, and we were used to have it free and it was not free anymore. \n\nDoes that mean you didn't had a personnal computer until late ? \nYes. I think it was round 2000. I didn't needed it really. I got one when the belgian UCP network became commercial. Of course i did not get Windows on it.  I think we got Linux here in 1994. There was a guy involved in the kernel studying here. So we did used it very fast.\n\nSo, what is software for you ?\nFor me software is the magic that make computer usable. I can only gives examples of what i mean by it. A PC without software most people, even computer scientists, can't do anything with it. You need basic software. Some software are already integrated in the computer hardware. Same for phones, tablets... The main characteristic, for me, is that it should be user friendly. That is very difficult i know, because you have to imagine what the people using your software are going to do with it and how they want to use it, that's the magic you need to solve.\n\nIs command line user friendly ? \nWell, somehow you have to learn the command langage that is in fact a computer langage where you can make all the constructs that other langages offers.\nYou can create loops, you can test, whatever. It's not so different from computer langages like C or JAVA or whatever. \n\nBut it's already software no ? User friendly depends on what you put behind these words, no ? \nYes it's already software. I don't have a strong opinion about command lines. It depends on people. I can imagine that someone that have never heard about the command line expect that you click somewhere and it happens. But if you know the command langage it's sometimes perhaps easier or productive to type commands and let it run. Sometimes, i find it easier if i have a screen and a number of buttons and i don't have to imagine what happens behind that screen. And sometimes i want to do something with the command line, because i'm used to it. That's why i don't trust myself about user friendliness because i have a long experience in computer interfaces. I'm so used to some of them perhaps i can't even imagine that somebody else would like to do it otherwise or doesn't like what i'm used to.\n\nApart from maintaining the museum, what do you work on ? You are still active in the department even though you are retired ? \nI work on sensors, in the internet of things world in one of the university spin-off. What i do for them is sensors wireless need power, and some of them are on batteries. They have designed a complete system which should makes the battery lasts for two, three, four years. They need a system to measure that. So i been working on a mechanism to measure that without waiting four years. That's programming instrumentation computers to mesure power or whatever, that's part Unix systems. There are enough new or unknown things and maybe because i'm older, i have another way of looking at things, so we have a lot of discussions. They don't like my Pearl, they use python, JAVA those things...Pearl, it has it's disavantage, but you could do a lot of thing, each character has a meaning. With Python, you need all those libraries...It's easy when you know the libraries you have to call. When you know the arguments of the librairies...so it's also complicated. ANd if the library change for some reasons, there you go. In my humble opinion it's the same with all the langages. It's starts easy from scratch but if you have to interface them with existing thing from the internet world or whatever it gets complicated.\n\nDo you have a last word ? \nI was surprised by your group reaction to the visit. I thought all of this were known. Maybe i'm getting old :) Curently i don't do much about the museum department, but sometimes i like to talk about the little stories about it. I remember a lot of little stories, a lot of technics who have been used and forgotten and some kept alive. I thought when i was young that the best techniques would succeed. That you would have visionnary people who would see the way. But i realized that a lot of thing happens by accident.\n\n\n\n\n","attribs":"*6|1+1*0*a*b*c+1*0+t*6|1+1*5+3p*6|1+1*5+4f*6|2+2+1y*d+n+47*d+1+76*6|2+2+4n*6|1+1|1+1*5+11*6|2+2+1s*e+1+41*d+2+3a*e+k+1l*6|2+2+38*0+6*0*2+x*0+21+48*2+3f+2y*6|2+2+9i*d+1+14*d+1+3j*6|2+2+6i*d+8+15*6|2+2*5+1a*6|2+2+1b*d+1+1u*d+6+1y*6|2+2*5+19*6|2+2+2p*d+1+3f*d+a+o*d+1+1b*d+1+2*d+l+9*d+2a+1*e+14+19*d+1+1b*d+u+1*6|2+2*5+1r*6|2+2+d*d+4+1e*d+1+1v*d+a+9*d+1+1*d+1+r*d+n+8l*0+1+5y*6|1+1+41*6|2+2*5+1a*6|2+2+5g*6|2+2*5+2w*6|2+2+l6*6|2+2*5+1f*6|2+2+43*0+1+f*0+2+1t*0+4+2*5+7+fc*0+33+55*6|1+1+x*0+f+1*0+12+1*0*2+1*0+37+2q*0+4+2*0|1+21*0+1f+1v*0+1+1*0*2+1*0+fh+3q*0+1+9s*0|2+2*5+1v*0|1+1+3y*0+4+6i*0|2+2*5+5m*0|1+1+30*0|1+1+48*2+15+9l*0|1+1+1*0|1+1+1*5+1y*0|1+1+tm*0|1+1+1*0|1+1*5+4t*0|1+1+dr*0|1+1+u6*0|2+2*5+x*0|1+1+5q*0|2+2*5+1q*0|1+1+5w*0|2+2*5+16*0|1+1+5b*0|1+1+3l*0|2+2*5+o*0|1+1+df*0|2+2*5+u*0|1+1+bs*0|2+2*5+29*0|1+1+eh*0|2+2*5+1s*0|1+1+7m*0|2+2*5+u*0|1+1+fk*0|2+2*5+w*0|1+1+48*0|1+1+3b*0|2+2*5+2m*0|1+1+m9*0|2+2*5+3i*0|1+1+xt*0|2+2*5+q*0|1+1+eh*0|1+1*6|3+3|1+1"}}},"pad:observatory.guide.jeanhuensitvextended:revs:8001":{"changeset":"Z:ess>1|t=2xf=5r*d+1$m","meta":{"author":"a.T2VW9Z1FoOo412v8","timestamp":1518186104356}},"pad:observatory.guide.jeanhuensitvextended:revs:8002":{"changeset":"Z:est>1|t=2xf=5s*d+1$p","meta":{"author":"a.T2VW9Z1FoOo412v8","timestamp":1518186104860}},"pad:observatory.guide.jeanhuensitvextended:revs:8003":{"changeset":"Z:esu>1|t=2xf=5t*d+1$u","meta":{"author":"a.T2VW9Z1FoOo412v8","timestamp":1518186105356}},"pad:observatory.guide.jeanhuensitvextended:revs:8004":{"changeset":"Z:esv>1|t=2xf=5u*d+1$t","meta":{"author":"a.T2VW9Z1FoOo412v8","timestamp":1518186105966}},"pad:observatory.guide.jeanhuensitvextended:revs:8005":{"changeset":"Z:esw>2|t=2xf=5v*d+2$er","meta":{"author":"a.T2VW9Z1FoOo412v8","timestamp":1518186106466}},"pad:observatory.guide.jeanhuensitvextended:revs:8006":{"changeset":"Z:esy<1|t=2xf=5w-1$","meta":{"author":"a.T2VW9Z1FoOo412v8","timestamp":1518186110290}},"pad:observatory.guide.jeanhuensitvextended:revs:8007":{"changeset":"Z:esx<1|t=2xf=5v-1$","meta":{"author":"a.T2VW9Z1FoOo412v8","timestamp":1518186110792}},"pad:observatory.guide.jeanhuensitvextended:revs:8008":{"changeset":"Z:esw<2|t=2xf=5t-2$","meta":{"author":"a.T2VW9Z1FoOo412v8","timestamp":1518186111292}},"pad:observatory.guide.jeanhuensitvextended:revs:8009":{"changeset":"Z:esu<2|t=2xf=5r-2$","meta":{"author":"a.T2VW9Z1FoOo412v8","timestamp":1518186111790}},"pad:observatory.guide.jeanhuensitvextended:revs:801":{"changeset":"Z:5i9>3|18=505=30*0*2+3$ll

Huens interview extended\n**You have been using computers since a long time, as you explained us during the tour we had the joy of assisting during the TGSO.**\n**I heard that that until recently, let's say the late 1990's, when learning computer programming you had to start by  writing down the program on paper... ** \n\nIn 1973, i did study computer sciences, it was the second year of the Computer Sciense course, here in Leuven. At the time computers were mainframes and you did fed them with programms by punch cards. Programing was writing down the program, then you punched it and the next day you get results, mostly error. That's the way it worked at that time. To teach us programing, they used the langage of that time, Fortran and some kind of invented assembly langage, it didn't really exist, it was simplified.\n\nMost of the time you did write down your program, the teacher and the assistant would have to tell you what is wrong or good, you didn't had much practical experience.\n\n**How was it like, tons of pages ?** \n\nNo. As an anecdocte, i remember punchcards were a block of papers, we were jealous of the people who came in the computer center with huge stacks of cards. That were really small programs, not complicated one. In fact you had to learn to use the computer from scratch, everything was new, you couldn't rely on previous experiences, everything was new. And to start with small programs was difficult enough. \n\nThat was also the time when Edsger W. Dijkstra, who faught against the goto and other then common but bad constructs (see A Case against the GOTO Statement https://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/EWD/transcriptions/EWD02xx/EWD215.html ). I still remember him, in an audience, giving us a lecture on good  techniques  in programming at the  International computing symposium 1977 in Liège (programming:  from craft to scientific discipline https://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/EWD/transcriptions/EWD05xx/EWD566.html). It was a rather hard course because Dijkstra expected you to quickly  understand and implement his ideas.\n\nAnd then from 75 on, computers became cheaper and could be bought by departments and smaller entities. And than came the first interactive computer. Still beasts about two cubic meters, costing two millions belgian francs. But it was low enough to allow people to type in directly commands. I started working here in 75 as a researcher, it has evolved continuously and i saw computers getting cheaper and getting easier to use.The way to use it was simplified, you could start to go to the beast and try it out.\n\nI remember more or less: you did write down the program in Fortran for instance… We always thought in the beginning that it would work and it didn't, so after a turn around you were giving it back to the operator and you have to wait another half a day or a night to get the results.\n\n**What kind of program you were working on?** \n\nI remember the first program i had to write was: you got three numbers, you had to make the program decide if you could construct a triangle with the numbers being the sides of the triangle.\n\n**That took an afternoon to be processed ?** \n\nWell, yeah. You had to imagine how to do it which was also one problem, than you prepare the cards with the punching machine and you give the package of cards to the operator who was feeeding the computer with the cards. Operator people had the taks to feed the computers by hands, with paper, cards, then cards got written on disks and later processed by the mainframe from disk. Finally results got printed on paper. it lasts onto the magnetic disks period. And after a number of hours or a night you got a listing, a piece of paper, with the results or program compilation errors.\n\n**When where you able to record the program onto the machine?**\n\nI think that did happen between 75 and 80. After the punching cards, which was already a way to record the program, we had  typewriters and then terminals. We could record the programs by typing it on the terminal  and the computer would store them on disk. We had magnetic discs. IBM had number for everything, i remember the 3300  [manufactured from 1970 on] was a magnetic disk. \nWe didn't touch the machines, operators would change the disks, we could only access the typewriter/terminal. That was our most direct connexion to the computer. The times were diffent. The mainframes were such huge costly beasts that it had operators day and night to keep it busy. Even at night there were two or three guys mounting tapes, dismounting tapes, that kind of stuff.\nhttps://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/42/IBM_magnetic_disk_drives_3330%2B3333.png/600px-IBM_magnetic_disk_drives_3330%2B3333.png\n\n**When did you stop working with operators?** \n\nSomewhere between 85 and 90. There were still operators at the main computer of the university, but there were also small computers, so researchers and student could have direct access when needed. \n\n**When did you start to work with software sold by others or gived away in order to do your research?** \n\nYou stil need an operating system on the mainframe that was delivered by IBM or the constructor delivering the mainframe. When you bought mini-computers, which were the  smaller versions of mainframes, in most cases you did buy an operating systems, compilers and all the stuff you did need to be able to program or work  those things. \nIn most cases,  the computer sciences department did buy the mini-computer from, for instance *Digital Equipment Corporation*,  a manufactorer at that time, but they didn't buy DEC's  software. The DEC so were not open source or free,  but you could get Unix and could run it on those digital equipment (DEC) computers. That is what the computer department of the University of Louvain la Neuve *l'unité d'informatique*, did and so did we.\n\n**When did you start working with unix as an os?** \n\nI took a trip to Amsterdam, it must have been in 1979/80… Well, the story starts in our french sister university (LLN) where they did have a PDP-11 with Unix on it. You got Unix, at the time, when you were a university, from Bell Labs (Ma Bell), the american telephone company. It was a mega organisation at the time [before the [dismantlment of AT&T/Bell system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breakup_of_the_Bell_System)].Due to monopoly, the US authorities splitted up in different Baby Bells. One of the restriction was there was a research baby bell, they couldn't really sell anything.There were computer scientists there, who did developped some Unix interesting things.  For universities you did get the source and no support for free. How to install it, no idea. In Unité d'informatique, where they had a PDP-11/70 https://i0.wp.com/www.utterpower.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/pdp11-70-panel.jpg  they were lucky: they got the same computer that unix were developped on.  They got the disk by snail mail as a post-office package. They mounted it and it did spin up and they had it.\nHere, we did have a cheaper PDP11, the PDP 11/60  (https://dave.cheney.net/tag/pdp-11). We got the Unix disk distribution from Bell Labs but we could not run it, because we got another type of disk(RK07). We could look at it but that was all, because our disc format was different than the one at Bell Labs. Somebody here (P.Verbaeten) did write a driver for that disk in l'unité \nd'informatique of LLN. But they did not have a RK07.  it did compile it but we couldn't try it because we did not have. The nearest place  with Unix and RK07 was in Vrije Universiteit  Amsterdam.  Andrew Tenebaum, who did write a number of books on operating systems, was working there. He was learning to speak dutch. We did understood his english better but his assistant explained that he needed to practice speaking Dutch because he would have to pass an exam. There we compiled Unix with an RK07 driver and stored it on a bootable RK07 disk. With that disk back in Leuven we could start  Unix on our PDP11/60. An error in the process meant a trip Leuven-Amsterdam and back.Than in my opinion the start of open source was Unix because we had to maintain it by ourselves and we learned a lot from the sources. In that time we did had to get software and it brings us to different places. For example, at the time the agents at the custom at the airport or post didn't know what to do with the discs in terms of custom clearance. They used magnetic or xrays, we had to write on the package that it should not be x-rayed. But we got time to time unreadable discs. \n\n**So it took like weeks between the transportation, the custom...**\nYes, the custom had to clear the packages. I remember i've been in the customs in Zaventem. I had received a letter that my package from Bell Labs had arrived. I went there thinking i would have to pay something and go. But no. It had to be cleared so there wa some organisation that had to do administrative stuff, so i only got it a few days later. The response time was huge :)\n\n**Than after that period of time how did you switch from that kind of collaboration on how to make software and make software work to collaboration on networks, between universities and researchers...**\nIn the Unix system of that time there was a kind of networking protocol which only did work on serial lines.\n You could connect two unix systems together you only need a line. We had one between LLN and Leuven, it's only 15 kms, but we had to ask Belgacom, than La Régie des télégraphes et téléphones, to get a modem to connect through their network and than over that modem you could reach an amazing speed of 300 characters per second. And that was the first communication. It did happened somewhere around 85. And then you had connexion with another computer, writing something here and do  something. And we could send programs to each other. \n \n **What was the first thing you did send through a network like this?**\n I didn't do it myself, i remember it was a kind of chat program. And on LLN side was Elie Milgrom, he is retired now. On this side, it was Pr Willems. And i remember that they typed something and they got a response from the other side and that was it.  But i remember that Pr Willems sent \"ok we stop now\". And that Elie Milgrom answered \"See you later, Alligator\" [a reference to Bill Haley and the Comets].  At the time we still had these kind of songs in mind. (lol). Those Unix to Unix connexions were first. And there was a worldwide Unix to Unix based network, Usenet (1979), it still exists somewhere... you can download load  of illegal movies and that stuff, that was not what we meant at the time. But that is what is left. And Usenet became gradually replaced by the Internet in USA. In Europe, the Internet came a lot later, but we had access to the Internet, we could send mail to them and we could receive mail from them, because some friendly american university, later companies, did translate internet mail to UCP mail. That was before the 1990's.\n \n **Your relation to software had changed at the time because you did not have to do all this manipulations with the software your received... Was it already floppy discs ?**\n No, magnetic tapes, for the mainframe at least. Most of the mini-computers had some cheaper magnetic tapes. Between 90 and 95 the main machines for the software institute was a VAX from DEC. Once a year the software came from Berkeley, it was still Unix but modified by Berkeley for virtual memory and all the stuff which are common now. We received a tape, with lot of goodies, i still remember we didn't know what was on there but we scrutinised there to know what was there, what we can use.\nIn Europe, companies like Siemens were trying to set up software centers to make software avaiable, they were even trying to set up networks. Researchers did love the Internet, it worked, it was useful for their researchs. So companies in Europe, were trying to set up their own networks, i remember for example the X/OPEN transport protocol. Their was a lot of standards about what software layers should do, but it didn't succeed because sometime, 92 maybe, IBM decided to quit their own private network and to go forTCP/IP and was the switching point. Everything done for X/OPEN were suddently forgotten. For the mainframes, and certainly in Belgium computing was mainly mainframes, i'm talking about universities here, so when IBM decided to go for TCP/IP we followed even though things were really slow. For example, Belgacom was not interested in running the Domain Name System so we did it here, for some time, starting in 1993 with Pierre Verbaten (https://www.dnsbelgium.be/en/history). Belgacom were focused on X25 (DCS - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X.25) so they missed it.\n\nIt was like the french Minitel ? \nWell, at that time we were really jealous about Minitel. Could you imagine that? Terminals?  At home ? You could work home with a computer ! You could send emails ! All in one, a pc computer with a modem ! \n\nHow did the research about software evolved in the department?\nI am mainly talking about network research but here there were people working on numerical analysis, computing, artificial intelligence ... I was just not involved in those research so i don't know much about it \n\nYou were focused on software and network..\nYes, we did produce some software. We did make software to generate compilers, there was some A.I. software in Prolog, numerical analysis  libraries... Some were sold or shared, it depends.  \nWe did sell some software since the beginning i think when it was not even a department but a professor and a couple of students.\n\nIs it when you joined ? \nNo it was already a department. I did study dutch industrial engeneering in electronics. At the time in electronics you did hear something about computers, i was interested in it i wanted to know more. I heard they had started a year before a degree in computer engeneering. It was the first year where industrial engineer could join. The only thing we knew about computer were in movies. I wanted to know how it work. I'm not sure i still know now even if maybe i have some ideas...\n\nHow many langage do you know ?\nAssembly, FORTRAN, PL-1 the langage invented by IBM to be the universal one, C, Cobol. Perl, i don't know, so more. I'm not fluent in any other langages, but i can read any langage especially well writtened, i know i can understand it and learn it...I know JAVA also. As a system administrator the thing i use most are the command line of UNIX and Perl. But that's because i'm more familiar with those two so it goes faster.\n\nHow did you see the rise of personnal computer and the software that goes with ? \nI have to admit that we missed it. We didn't see that what was new was powerful. We were not impressed by the software. I remember windows 95, the news on TV, people sleeping on the street to get it. I remember when i get my first windows version, with a box of 22 floppies or so. Then i wanted to do something, to compile a program, but there was no compiler. We were used to Unix, a basic system but with a lot of utilities in it. Software was for us free, and we were used to have it free and it was not free anymore. \n\nDoes that mean you didn't had a personnal computer until late ? \nYes. I think it was round 2000. I didn't needed it really. I got one when the belgian UCP network became commercial. Of course i did not get Windows on it.  I think we got Linux here in 1994. There was a guy involved in the kernel studying here. So we did used it very fast.\n\nSo, what is software for you ?\nFor me software is the magic that make computer usable. I can only gives examples of what i mean by it. A PC without software most people, even computer scientists, can't do anything with it. You need basic software. Some software are already integrated in the computer hardware. Same for phones, tablets... The main characteristic, for me, is that it should be user friendly. That is very difficult i know, because you have to imagine what the people using your software are going to do with it and how they want to use it, that's the magic you need to solve.\n\nIs command line user friendly ? \nWell, somehow you have to learn the command langage that is in fact a computer langage where you can make all the constructs that other langages offers.\nYou can create loops, you can test, whatever. It's not so different from computer langages like C or JAVA or whatever. \n\nBut it's already software no ? User friendly depends on what you put behind these words, no ? \nYes it's already software. I don't have a strong opinion about command lines. It depends on people. I can imagine that someone that have never heard about the command line expect that you click somewhere and it happens. But if you know the command langage it's sometimes perhaps easier or productive to type commands and let it run. Sometimes, i find it easier if i have a screen and a number of buttons and i don't have to imagine what happens behind that screen. And sometimes i want to do something with the command line, because i'm used to it. That's why i don't trust myself about user friendliness because i have a long experience in computer interfaces. I'm so used to some of them perhaps i can't even imagine that somebody else would like to do it otherwise or doesn't like what i'm used to.\n\nApart from maintaining the museum, what do you work on ? You are still active in the department even though you are retired ? \nI work on sensors, in the internet of things world in one of the university spin-off. What i do for them is sensors wireless need power, and some of them are on batteries. They have designed a complete system which should makes the battery lasts for two, three, four years. They need a system to measure that. So i been working on a mechanism to measure that without waiting four years. That's programming instrumentation computers to mesure power or whatever, that's part Unix systems. There are enough new or unknown things and maybe because i'm older, i have another way of looking at things, so we have a lot of discussions. They don't like my Pearl, they use python, JAVA those things...Pearl, it has it's disavantage, but you could do a lot of thing, each character has a meaning. With Python, you need all those libraries...It's easy when you know the libraries you have to call. When you know the arguments of the librairies...so it's also complicated. ANd if the library change for some reasons, there you go. In my humble opinion it's the same with all the langages. It's starts easy from scratch but if you have to interface them with existing thing from the internet world or whatever it gets complicated.\n\nDo you have a last word ? \nI was surprised by your group reaction to the visit. I thought all of this were known. Maybe i'm getting old :) Curently i don't do much about the museum department, but sometimes i like to talk about the little stories about it. I remember a lot of little stories, a lot of technics who have been used and forgotten and some kept alive. I thought when i was young that the best techniques would succeed. That you would have visionnary people who would see the way. But i realized that a lot of thing happens by accident.\n\n\n\n\n","attribs":"*6|1+1*0*a*b*c+1*0+t*6|1+1*5+3p*6|1+1*5+4f*6|2+2+1y*d+n+47*d+1+76*6|2+2+4n*6|1+1|1+1*5+11*6|2+2+1s*e+1+41*d+2+3a*e+k+1l*6|2+2+38*0+6*0*2+x*0+21+48*2+3f+2y*6|2+2+9i*d+1+14*d+1+3j*6|2+2+6i*d+8+15*6|2+2*5+1a*6|2+2+1b*d+1+1u*d+6+1y*6|2+2*5+19*6|2+2+2p*d+1+3f*d+a+o*d+1+1b*d+1+2*d+l+9*d+2a+1*e+14+19*d+1+1b*d+u+1*6|2+2*5+1r*6|2+2+d*d+4+1e*d+1+1v*d+a+9*d+1+1*d+1+r*d+u+1*d+n+e*d*e+4*e+8+1t*d+1+2*d+1+s*d+4+h*d|1+1+2r*d+9+1l*0+1+2s*d+3+33*6|1+1+41*6|2+2*5+1a*6|2+2+4h*d+4+x*6|2+2*5+2w*6|2+2+7u*d+4+q*d+9+f*d|1+1+f*d+1+27*d+1+7*d+1+9*d+1+t*d+2+w*d+6+e*d+7+6j*6|2+2*5+1f*6|2+2+43*0+1+f*0+2+1t*0+4+2*5+7+fc*0+33+55*6|1+1+x*0+f+1*0+12+1*0*2+1*0+37+2q*0+4+2*0|1+21*0+1f+1v*0+1+1*0*2+1*0+fh+3q*0+1+9s*0|2+2*5+1v*0|1+1+3y*0+4+6i*0|2+2*5+5m*0|1+1+30*0|1+1+48*2+15+9l*0|1+1+1*0|1+1+1*5+1y*0|1+1+tm*0|1+1+1*0|1+1*5+4t*0|1+1+dr*0|1+1+u6*0|2+2*5+x*0|1+1+5q*0|2+2*5+1q*0|1+1+5w*0|2+2*5+16*0|1+1+5b*0|1+1+3l*0|2+2*5+o*0|1+1+df*0|2+2*5+u*0|1+1+bs*0|2+2*5+29*0|1+1+eh*0|2+2*5+1s*0|1+1+7m*0|2+2*5+u*0|1+1+fk*0|2+2*5+w*0|1+1+48*0|1+1+3b*0|2+2*5+2m*0|1+1+m9*0|2+2*5+3i*0|1+1+xt*0|2+2*5+q*0|1+1+eh*0|1+1*6|3+3|1+1"}}},"pad:observatory.guide.jeanhuensitvextended:revs:8101":{"changeset":"Z:eu4>1|14=45x=5o*d+1$f","meta":{"author":"a.T2VW9Z1FoOo412v8","timestamp":1518186797211}},"pad:observatory.guide.jeanhuensitvextended:revs:8102":{"changeset":"Z:eu5>1|14=45x=5p*d+1$t","meta":{"author":"a.T2VW9Z1FoOo412v8","timestamp":1518186797839}},"pad:observatory.guide.jeanhuensitvextended:revs:8103":{"changeset":"Z:eu6>1|14=45x=5q*d+1$w","meta":{"author":"a.T2VW9Z1FoOo412v8","timestamp":1518186798337}},"pad:observatory.guide.jeanhuensitvextended:revs:8104":{"changeset":"Z:eu7>3|14=45x=5r*d+3$are","meta":{"author":"a.T2VW9Z1FoOo412v8","timestamp":1518186798846}},"pad:observatory.guide.jeanhuensitvextended:revs:8105":{"changeset":"Z:eua>1|14=45x=5u*d+1$

Huens interview extended\n**You have been using computers since a long time, as you explained us during the tour we had the joy of assisting during the TGSO.**\n**I heard that that until recently, let's say the late 1990's, when learning computer programming you had to start by  writing down the program on paper... ** \n\nIn 1973, i did study computer sciences, it was the second year of the Computer Sciense course, here in Leuven. At the time computers were mainframes and you did fed them with programms by punch cards. Programing was writing down the program, then you punched it and the next day you get results, mostly error. That's the way it worked at that time. To teach us programing, they used the langage of that time, Fortran and some kind of invented assembly langage, it didn't really exist, it was simplified.\n\nMost of the time you did write down your program, the teacher and the assistant would have to tell you what is wrong or good, you didn't had much practical experience.\n\n**How was it like, tons of pages ?** \n\nNo. As an anecdocte, i remember punchcards were a block of papers, we were jealous of the people who came in the computer center with huge stacks of cards. That were really small programs, not complicated one. In fact you had to learn to use the computer from scratch, everything was new, you couldn't rely on previous experiences, everything was new. And to start with small programs was difficult enough. \n\nThat was also the time when Edsger W. Dijkstra, who faught against the goto and other then common but bad constructs [@[text:1972:goto]. I still remember him, in an audience, giving us a lecture on good  techniques  in programming at the  International computing symposium 1977 in Liège (programming:  from craft to scientific discipline https://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/EWD/transcriptions/EWD05xx/EWD566.html). It was a rather hard course because Dijkstra expected you to quickly  understand and implement his ideas.\n\nAnd then from 75 on, computers became cheaper and could be bought by departments and smaller entities. And than came the first interactive computer. Still beasts about two cubic meters, costing two millions belgian francs. But it was low enough to allow people to type in directly commands. I started working here in 75 as a researcher, it has evolved continuously and i saw computers getting cheaper and getting easier to use.The way to use it was simplified, you could start to go to the beast and try it out.\n\nI remember more or less: you did write down the program in Fortran for instance… We always thought in the beginning that it would work and it didn't, so after a turn around you were giving it back to the operator and you have to wait another half a day or a night to get the results.\n\n**What kind of program you were working on?** \n\nI remember the first program i had to write was: you got three numbers, you had to make the program decide if you could construct a triangle with the numbers being the sides of the triangle.\n\n**That took an afternoon to be processed ?** \n\nWell, yeah. You had to imagine how to do it which was also one problem, than you prepare the cards with the punching machine and you give the package of cards to the operator who was feeeding the computer with the cards. Operator people had the taks to feed the computers by hands, with paper, cards, then cards got written on disks and later processed by the mainframe from disk. Finally results got printed on paper. it lasts onto the magnetic disks period. And after a number of hours or a night you got a listing, a piece of paper, with the results or program compilation errors.\n\n**When where you able to record the program onto the machine?**\n\nI think that did happen between 75 and 80. After the punching cards, which was already a way to record the program, we had  typewriters and then terminals. We could record the programs by typing it on the terminal  and the computer would store them on disk. We had magnetic discs. IBM had number for everything, i remember the 3300  [manufactured from 1970 on] was a magnetic disk. \nWe didn't touch the machines, operators would change the disks, we could only access the typewriter/terminal. That was our most direct connexion to the computer. The times were diffent. The mainframes were such huge costly beasts that it had operators day and night to keep it busy. Even at night there were two or three guys mounting tapes, dismounting tapes, that kind of stuff.\nhttps://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/42/IBM_magnetic_disk_drives_3330%2B3333.png/600px-IBM_magnetic_disk_drives_3330%2B3333.png\n\n**When did you stop working with operators?** \n\nSomewhere between 85 and 90. There were still operators at the main computer of the university, but there were also small computers, so researchers and student could have direct access when needed. \n\n**When did you start to work with software sold by others or gived away in order to do your research?** \n\nYou stil need an operating system on the mainframe that was delivered by IBM or the constructor delivering the mainframe. When you bought mini-computers, which were the  smaller versions of mainframes, in most cases you did buy an operating systems, compilers and all the stuff you did need to be able to program or work  those things. \nIn most cases,  the computer sciences department did buy the mini-computer from, for instance *Digital Equipment Corporation*,  a manufactorer at that time, but they didn't buy DEC's  software. The DEC software  was not open source or free,  and as a university we could get Unix for free and could run it on those digital equipment  DEC computers. That is what the computer department of the University of Louvain la Neuve *l'unité d'informatique*, did and so did we.\n\n**When did you start working with unix as an os?** \n\nI took a trip to Amsterdam, it must have been in 1979/80… Well, the story starts in our french sister university (LLN) where they did have a PDP-11 with Unix on it. You could get got Unix, at the time, when you were a university, from Bell Labs ( part of AT&T ), the american telephone company. ATT was a mega organisation at the time [before the [dismantlment of AT&T/Bell system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breakup_of_the_Bell_System)]. Due to monopoly, the US authorities did split it up in different Baby Bells. One of the restriction was that the  research baby bell,  could n really sell anything.There were computer scientists there, who did developped some Unix interesting things.  For universities you did get the source and no support for free. How to install it, no idea. In Unité d'informatique, where they had a PDP-11/70 https://i0.wp.com/www.utterpower.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/pdp11-70-panel.jpg  they were lucky: they got the same computer that unix were developped on.  They got the disk by snail mail as a post-office package. They mounted it and it did spin up and they had it.\nHere, we did have a cheaper PDP11, the PDP 11/60  (https://dave.cheney.net/tag/pdp-11). We got the Unix disk distribution from Bell Labs but we could not run it, because we got another type of disk(RK07). We could look at it but that was all, because our disc format was different than the one at Bell Labs. Somebody here (P.Verbaeten) did write a driver for that disk in l'unité \nd'informatique of LLN. But they did not have a RK07.  it did compile it but we couldn't try it because we did not have. The nearest place  with Unix and RK07 was in Vrije Universiteit  Amsterdam.  Andrew Tenebaum, who did write a number of books on operating systems, was working there. He was learning to speak dutch. We did understood his english better but his assistant explained that he needed to practice speaking Dutch because he would have to pass an exam. There we compiled Unix with an RK07 driver and stored it on a bootable RK07 disk. With that disk back in Leuven we could start  Unix on our PDP11/60. An error in the process meant a trip Leuven-Amsterdam and back.Than in my opinion the start of open source was Unix because we had to maintain it by ourselves and we learned a lot from the sources. In that time we did had to get software and it brings us to different places. For example, at the time the agents at the custom at the airport or post didn't know what to do with the discs in terms of custom clearance. They used magnetic or xrays, we had to write on the package that it should not be x-rayed. But we got time to time unreadable discs. \n\n**So it took like weeks between the transportation, the custom...**\nYes, the custom had to clear the packages. I remember i've been in the customs in Zaventem. I had received a letter that my package from Bell Labs had arrived. I went there thinking i would have to pay something and go. But no. It had to be cleared so there wa some organisation that had to do administrative stuff, so i only got it a few days later. The response time was huge :)\n\n**Than after that period of time how did you switch from that kind of collaboration on how to make software and make software work to collaboration on networks, between universities and researchers...**\nIn the Unix system of that time there was a kind of networking protocol which only did work on serial lines.\n You could connect two unix systems together you only need a line. We had one between LLN and Leuven, it's only 15 kms, but we had to ask Belgacom, than La Régie des télégraphes et téléphones, to get a modem to connect through their network and than over that modem you could reach an amazing speed of 300 characters per second. And that was the first communication. It did happened somewhere around 85. And then you had connexion with another computer, writing something here and do  something. And we could send programs to each other. \n \n **What was the first thing you did send through a network like this?**\n I didn't do it myself, i remember it was a kind of chat program. And on LLN side was Elie Milgrom, he is retired now. On this side, it was Pr Willems. And i remember that they typed something and they got a response from the other side and that was it.  But i remember that Pr Willems sent \"ok we stop now\". And that Elie Milgrom answered \"See you later, Alligator\" [a reference to Bill Haley and the Comets].  At the time we still had these kind of songs in mind. (lol). Those Unix to Unix connexions were first. And there was a worldwide Unix to Unix based network, Usenet (1979), it still exists somewhere... you can download load  of illegal movies and that stuff, that was not what we meant at the time. But that is what is left. And Usenet became gradually replaced by the Internet in USA. In Europe, the Internet came a lot later, but we had access to the Internet, we could send mail to them and we could receive mail from them, because some friendly american university, later companies, did translate internet mail to UCP mail. That was before the 1990's.\n \n **Your relation to software had changed at the time because you did not have to do all this manipulations with the software your received... Was it already floppy discs ?**\n No, magnetic tapes, for the mainframe at least. Most of the mini-computers had some cheaper magnetic tapes. Between 90 and 95 the main machines for the software institute was a VAX from DEC. Once a year the software came from Berkeley, it was still Unix but modified by Berkeley for virtual memory and all the stuff which are common now. We received a tape, with lot of goodies, i still remember we didn't know what was on there but we scrutinised there to know what was there, what we can use.\nIn Europe, companies like Siemens were trying to set up software centers to make software avaiable, they were even trying to set up networks. Researchers did love the Internet, it worked, it was useful for their researchs. So companies in Europe, were trying to set up their own networks, i remember for example the X/OPEN transport protocol. Their was a lot of standards about what software layers should do, but it didn't succeed because sometime, 92 maybe, IBM decided to quit their own private network and to go forTCP/IP and was the switching point. Everything done for X/OPEN were suddently forgotten. For the mainframes, and certainly in Belgium computing was mainly mainframes, i'm talking about universities here, so when IBM decided to go for TCP/IP we followed even though things were really slow. For example, Belgacom was not interested in running the Domain Name System so we did it here, for some time, starting in 1993 with Pierre Verbaten (https://www.dnsbelgium.be/en/history). Belgacom were focused on X25 (DCS - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X.25) so they missed it.\n\nIt was like the french Minitel ? \nWell, at that time we were really jealous about Minitel. Could you imagine that? Terminals?  At home ? You could work home with a computer ! You could send emails ! All in one, a pc computer with a modem ! \n\nHow did the research about software evolved in the department?\nI am mainly talking about network research but here there were people working on numerical analysis, computing, artificial intelligence ... I was just not involved in those research so i don't know much about it \n\nYou were focused on software and network..\nYes, we did produce some software. We did make software to generate compilers, there was some A.I. software in Prolog, numerical analysis  libraries... Some were sold or shared, it depends.  \nWe did sell some software since the beginning i think when it was not even a department but a professor and a couple of students.\n\nIs it when you joined ? \nNo it was already a department. I did study dutch industrial engeneering in electronics. At the time in electronics you did hear something about computers, i was interested in it i wanted to know more. I heard they had started a year before a degree in computer engeneering. It was the first year where industrial engineer could join. The only thing we knew about computer were in movies. I wanted to know how it work. I'm not sure i still know now even if maybe i have some ideas...\n\nHow many langage do you know ?\nAssembly, FORTRAN, PL-1 the langage invented by IBM to be the universal one, C, Cobol. Perl, i don't know, so more. I'm not fluent in any other langages, but i can read any langage especially well writtened, i know i can understand it and learn it...I know JAVA also. As a system administrator the thing i use most are the command line of UNIX and Perl. But that's because i'm more familiar with those two so it goes faster.\n\nHow did you see the rise of personnal computer and the software that goes with ? \nI have to admit that we missed it. We didn't see that what was new was powerful. We were not impressed by the software. I remember windows 95, the news on TV, people sleeping on the street to get it. I remember when i get my first windows version, with a box of 22 floppies or so. Then i wanted to do something, to compile a program, but there was no compiler. We were used to Unix, a basic system but with a lot of utilities in it. Software was for us free, and we were used to have it free and it was not free anymore. \n\nDoes that mean you didn't had a personnal computer until late ? \nYes. I think it was round 2000. I didn't needed it really. I got one when the belgian UCP network became commercial. Of course i did not get Windows on it.  I think we got Linux here in 1994. There was a guy involved in the kernel studying here. So we did used it very fast.\n\nSo, what is software for you ?\nFor me software is the magic that make computer usable. I can only gives examples of what i mean by it. A PC without software most people, even computer scientists, can't do anything with it. You need basic software. Some software are already integrated in the computer hardware. Same for phones, tablets... The main characteristic, for me, is that it should be user friendly. That is very difficult i know, because you have to imagine what the people using your software are going to do with it and how they want to use it, that's the magic you need to solve.\n\nIs command line user friendly ? \nWell, somehow you have to learn the command langage that is in fact a computer langage where you can make all the constructs that other langages offers.\nYou can create loops, you can test, whatever. It's not so different from computer langages like C or JAVA or whatever. \n\nBut it's already software no ? User friendly depends on what you put behind these words, no ? \nYes it's already software. I don't have a strong opinion about command lines. It depends on people. I can imagine that someone that have never heard about the command line expect that you click somewhere and it happens. But if you know the command langage it's sometimes perhaps easier or productive to type commands and let it run. Sometimes, i find it easier if i have a screen and a number of buttons and i don't have to imagine what happens behind that screen. And sometimes i want to do something with the command line, because i'm used to it. That's why i don't trust myself about user friendliness because i have a long experience in computer interfaces. I'm so used to some of them perhaps i can't even imagine that somebody else would like to do it otherwise or doesn't like what i'm used to.\n\nApart from maintaining the museum, what do you work on ? You are still active in the department even though you are retired ? \nI work on sensors, in the internet of things world in one of the university spin-off. What i do for them is sensors wireless need power, and some of them are on batteries. They have designed a complete system which should makes the battery lasts for two, three, four years. They need a system to measure that. So i been working on a mechanism to measure that without waiting four years. That's programming instrumentation computers to mesure power or whatever, that's part Unix systems. There are enough new or unknown things and maybe because i'm older, i have another way of looking at things, so we have a lot of discussions. They don't like my Pearl, they use python, JAVA those things...Pearl, it has it's disavantage, but you could do a lot of thing, each character has a meaning. With Python, you need all those libraries...It's easy when you know the libraries you have to call. When you know the arguments of the librairies...so it's also complicated. ANd if the library change for some reasons, there you go. In my humble opinion it's the same with all the langages. It's starts easy from scratch but if you have to interface them with existing thing from the internet world or whatever it gets complicated.\n\nDo you have a last word ? \nI was surprised by your group reaction to the visit. I thought all of this were known. Maybe i'm getting old :) Curently i don't do much about the museum department, but sometimes i like to talk about the little stories about it. I remember a lot of little stories, a lot of technics who have been used and forgotten and some kept alive. I thought when i was young that the best techniques would succeed. That you would have visionnary people who would see the way. But i realized that a lot of thing happens by accident.\n\n\n\n\n","attribs":"*6|1+1*0*a*b*c+1*0+t*6|1+1*5+3p*6|1+1*5+4f*6|2+2+1y*d+n+47*d+1+76*6|2+2+4n*6|1+1|1+1*5+11*6|2+2+1s*e+1+41*d+2+3a*e+k+1l*6|2+2+38*0+j+48*2+3f+2y*6|2+2+9i*d+1+14*d+1+3j*6|2+2+6i*d+8+15*6|2+2*5+1a*6|2+2+1b*d+1+1u*d+6+1y*6|2+2*5+19*6|2+2+2p*d+1+3f*d+a+o*d+1+1b*d+1+2*d+l+9*d+2a+1*e+14+19*d+1+1b*d+u+1*6|2+2*5+1r*6|2+2+d*d+4+1e*d+1+1v*d+a+9*d+1+1*d+1+r*d+u+1*d+n+e*d*e+4*e+8+1t*d+1+2*d+1+s*d+4+h*d|1+1+2r*d+9+1l*0+1+2s*d+3+33*6|1+1+41*6|2+2*5+1a*6|2+2+4h*d+4+x*6|2+2*5+2w*6|2+2+7u*d+4+q*d+9+f*d|1+1+f*d+1+27*d+1+7*d+1+9*d+1+t*d+2+w*d+6+e*d+e+2*d+2+r*d+m+g*d+9+q*e+i*d+1+3q*6|2+2*5+1f*6|2+2+43*0+1+f*0+2+4*d+a*e+3+1h*d+p+z*d+3+3z*d+1+10*d+4+5*d+3+1n*d+6+r*d+2+6b*0+33+55*6|1+1+x*0+f+1*0+12+1*0*2+1*0+37+2q*0+4+2*0|1+21*0+1f+1v*0+1+1*0*2+1*0+fh+3q*0+1+9s*0|2+2*5+1v*0|1+1+3y*0+4+6i*0|2+2*5+5m*0|1+1+30*0|1+1+48*2+15+9l*0|1+1+1*0|1+1+1*5+1y*0|1+1+tm*0|1+1+1*0|1+1*5+4t*0|1+1+dr*0|1+1+u6*0|2+2*5+x*0|1+1+5q*0|2+2*5+1q*0|1+1+5w*0|2+2*5+16*0|1+1+5b*0|1+1+3l*0|2+2*5+o*0|1+1+df*0|2+2*5+u*0|1+1+bs*0|2+2*5+29*0|1+1+eh*0|2+2*5+1s*0|1+1+7m*0|2+2*5+u*0|1+1+fk*0|2+2*5+w*0|1+1+48*0|1+1+3b*0|2+2*5+2m*0|1+1+m9*0|2+2*5+3i*0|1+1+xt*0|2+2*5+q*0|1+1+eh*0|1+1*6|3+3|1+1"}}},"pad:observatory.guide.jeanhuensitvextended:revs:8201":{"changeset":"Z:ess>1|18=4hv=g8*d+1$o","meta":{"author":"a.T2VW9Z1FoOo412v8","timestamp":1518187249702}},"pad:observatory.guide.jeanhuensitvextended:revs:8202":{"changeset":"Z:est>1|18=4hv=g9*d+1$t","meta":{"author":"a.T2VW9Z1FoOo412v8","timestamp":1518187250204}},"pad:observatory.guide.jeanhuensitvextended:revs:8203":{"changeset":"Z:esu<7|18=4hv=gb-7$","meta":{"author":"a.T2VW9Z1FoOo412v8","timestamp":1518187256925}},"pad:observatory.guide.jeanhuensitvextended:revs:8204":{"changeset":"Z:esn>1|18=4hv=gp*d+1$

Huens interview extended\n**You have been using computers since a long time, as you explained us during the tour we had the joy of assisting during the TGSO.**\n**I heard that that until recently, let's say the late 1990's, when learning computer programming you had to start by  writing down the program on paper... ** \n\nIn 1973, i did study computer sciences, it was the second year of the Computer Sciense course, here in Leuven. At the time computers were mainframes and you did fed them with programms by punch cards. Programing was writing down the program, then you punched it and the next day you get results, mostly error. That's the way it worked at that time. To teach us programing, they used the langage of that time, Fortran and some kind of invented assembly langage, it didn't really exist, it was simplified.\n\nMost of the time you did write down your program, the teacher and the assistant would have to tell you what is wrong or good, you didn't had much practical experience.\n\n**How was it like, tons of pages ?** \n\nNo. As an anecdocte, i remember punchcards were a block of papers, we were jealous of the people who came in the computer center with huge stacks of cards. That were really small programs, not complicated one. In fact you had to learn to use the computer from scratch, everything was new, you couldn't rely on previous experiences, everything was new. And to start with small programs was difficult enough. \n\nThat was also the time when Edsger W. Dijkstra, who faught against the goto and other then common but bad constructs [@[text:1972:goto]. I still remember him, in an audience, giving us a lecture on good  techniques  in programming at the  International computing symposium 1977 in Liège (programming:  from craft to scientific discipline https://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/EWD/transcriptions/EWD05xx/EWD566.html). It was a rather hard course because Dijkstra expected you to quickly  understand and implement his ideas.\n\nAnd then from 75 on, computers became cheaper and could be bought by departments and smaller entities. And than came the first interactive computer. Still beasts about two cubic meters, costing two millions belgian francs. But it was low enough to allow people to type in directly commands. I started working here in 75 as a researcher, it has evolved continuously and i saw computers getting cheaper and getting easier to use.The way to use it was simplified, you could start to go to the beast and try it out.\n\nI remember more or less: you did write down the program in Fortran for instance… We always thought in the beginning that it would work and it didn't, so after a turn around you were giving it back to the operator and you have to wait another half a day or a night to get the results.\n\n**What kind of program you were working on?** \n\nI remember the first program i had to write was: you got three numbers, you had to make the program decide if you could construct a triangle with the numbers being the sides of the triangle.\n\n**That took an afternoon to be processed ?** \n\nWell, yeah. You had to imagine how to do it which was also one problem, than you prepare the cards with the punching machine and you give the package of cards to the operator who was feeeding the computer with the cards. Operator people had the taks to feed the computers by hands, with paper, cards, then cards got written on disks and later processed by the mainframe from disk. Finally results got printed on paper. it lasts onto the magnetic disks period. And after a number of hours or a night you got a listing, a piece of paper, with the results or program compilation errors.\n\n**When where you able to record the program onto the machine?**\n\nI think that did happen between 75 and 80. After the punching cards, which was already a way to record the program, we had  typewriters and then terminals. We could record the programs by typing it on the terminal  and the computer would store them on disk. We had magnetic discs. IBM had number for everything, i remember the 3300  [manufactured from 1970 on] was a magnetic disk. \nWe didn't touch the machines, operators would change the disks, we could only access the typewriter/terminal. That was our most direct connexion to the computer. The times were diffent. The mainframes were such huge costly beasts that it had operators day and night to keep it busy. Even at night there were two or three guys mounting tapes, dismounting tapes, that kind of stuff.\nhttps://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/42/IBM_magnetic_disk_drives_3330%2B3333.png/600px-IBM_magnetic_disk_drives_3330%2B3333.png\n\n**When did you stop working with operators?** \n\nSomewhere between 85 and 90. There were still operators at the main computer of the university, but there were also small computers, so researchers and student could have direct access when needed. \n\n**When did you start to work with software sold by others or gived away in order to do your research?** \n\nYou stil need an operating system on the mainframe that was delivered by IBM or the constructor delivering the mainframe. When you bought mini-computers, which were the  smaller versions of mainframes, in most cases you did buy an operating systems, compilers and all the stuff you did need to be able to program or work  those things. \nIn most cases,  the computer sciences department did buy the mini-computer from, for instance *Digital Equipment Corporation*,  a manufactorer at that time, but they didn't buy DEC's  software. The DEC software  was not open source or free,  and as a university we could get Unix for free and could run it on those digital equipment  DEC computers. That is what the computer department of the University of Louvain la Neuve *l'unité d'informatique*, did and so did we.\n\n**When did you start working with unix as an os?** \n\nI took a trip to Amsterdam, it must have been in 1979/80… Well, the story starts in our french sister university (LLN) where they did have a PDP-11 with Unix on it. You could get got Unix, at the time, when you were a university, from Bell Labs ( part of AT&T ), the american telephone company. ATT was a mega organisation at the time [before the [dismantlment of AT&T/Bell system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breakup_of_the_Bell_System)]. Due to monopoly, the US authorities did split it up in different Baby Bells. One of the restriction was that the  research baby bell,  could not sell anything. There were computer scientists there, who did developped some interesting things (e.g. Unix).  For universities you did get the source for free, but NO  support, nothing not even how to install it. In Unité d'informatique, where they had a PDP-11/70 https://i0.wp.com/www.utterpower.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/pdp11-70-panel.jpg  they were lucky: they got the same computer that unix was developped on.  They got the disk by snail mail as a post-office package. They mounted it and it did spin up and they had UNIX.\nHere, we did have a cheaper PDP11, the PDP 11/60  (https://dave.cheney.net/tag/pdp-11). We got the Unix disk distribution from Bell Labs but we could not run it, because we got another type of disk(RK07). We could look at it but that was all, because our disc format was different than the one at Bell Labs. Somebody here (P.Verbaeten) did write a driver for that disk in l'unité \nd'informatique of LLN. But they did not have a RK07.  it did compile it but we couldn't try it because we did not have. The nearest place  with Unix and RK07 was in Vrije Universiteit  Amsterdam.  Andrew Tenebaum, who did write a number of books on operating systems, was working there. He was learning to speak dutch. We did understood his english better but his assistant explained that he needed to practice speaking Dutch because he would have to pass an exam. There we compiled Unix with an RK07 driver and stored it on a bootable RK07 disk. With that disk back in Leuven we could start  Unix on our PDP11/60. An error in the process meant a trip Leuven-Amsterdam and back.\nIn my opinion the start of open source was Unix because everybody  had to maintain it by ourselves and we learned a lot from the sources. \nIn that time we did have to store software on magnand it brings us to different places. For example, at the time the agents at the custom at the airport or post didn't know what to do with the discs in terms of custom clearance. They used magnetic or xrays, we had to write on the package that it should not be x-rayed. But we got time to time unreadable discs. \n\n**So it took like weeks between the transportation, the custom...**\nYes, the custom had to clear the packages. I remember i've been in the customs in Zaventem. I had received a letter that my package from Bell Labs had arrived. I went there thinking i would have to pay something and go. But no. It had to be cleared so there wa some organisation that had to do administrative stuff, so i only got it a few days later. The response time was huge :)\n\n**Than after that period of time how did you switch from that kind of collaboration on how to make software and make software work to collaboration on networks, between universities and researchers...**\nIn the Unix system of that time there was a kind of networking protocol which only did work on serial lines.\n You could connect two unix systems together you only need a line. We had one between LLN and Leuven, it's only 15 kms, but we had to ask Belgacom, than La Régie des télégraphes et téléphones, to get a modem to connect through their network and than over that modem you could reach an amazing speed of 300 characters per second. And that was the first communication. It did happened somewhere around 85. And then you had connexion with another computer, writing something here and do  something. And we could send programs to each other. \n \n **What was the first thing you did send through a network like this?**\n I didn't do it myself, i remember it was a kind of chat program. And on LLN side was Elie Milgrom, he is retired now. On this side, it was Pr Willems. And i remember that they typed something and they got a response from the other side and that was it.  But i remember that Pr Willems sent \"ok we stop now\". And that Elie Milgrom answered \"See you later, Alligator\" [a reference to Bill Haley and the Comets].  At the time we still had these kind of songs in mind. (lol). Those Unix to Unix connexions were first. And there was a worldwide Unix to Unix based network, Usenet (1979), it still exists somewhere... you can download load  of illegal movies and that stuff, that was not what we meant at the time. But that is what is left. And Usenet became gradually replaced by the Internet in USA. In Europe, the Internet came a lot later, but we had access to the Internet, we could send mail to them and we could receive mail from them, because some friendly american university, later companies, did translate internet mail to UCP mail. That was before the 1990's.\n \n **Your relation to software had changed at the time because you did not have to do all this manipulations with the software your received... Was it already floppy discs ?**\n No, magnetic tapes, for the mainframe at least. Most of the mini-computers had some cheaper magnetic tapes. Between 90 and 95 the main machines for the software institute was a VAX from DEC. Once a year the software came from Berkeley, it was still Unix but modified by Berkeley for virtual memory and all the stuff which are common now. We received a tape, with lot of goodies, i still remember we didn't know what was on there but we scrutinised there to know what was there, what we can use.\nIn Europe, companies like Siemens were trying to set up software centers to make software avaiable, they were even trying to set up networks. Researchers did love the Internet, it worked, it was useful for their researchs. So companies in Europe, were trying to set up their own networks, i remember for example the X/OPEN transport protocol. Their was a lot of standards about what software layers should do, but it didn't succeed because sometime, 92 maybe, IBM decided to quit their own private network and to go forTCP/IP and was the switching point. Everything done for X/OPEN were suddently forgotten. For the mainframes, and certainly in Belgium computing was mainly mainframes, i'm talking about universities here, so when IBM decided to go for TCP/IP we followed even though things were really slow. For example, Belgacom was not interested in running the Domain Name System so we did it here, for some time, starting in 1993 with Pierre Verbaten (https://www.dnsbelgium.be/en/history). Belgacom were focused on X25 (DCS - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X.25) so they missed it.\n\nIt was like the french Minitel ? \nWell, at that time we were really jealous about Minitel. Could you imagine that? Terminals?  At home ? You could work home with a computer ! You could send emails ! All in one, a pc computer with a modem ! \n\nHow did the research about software evolved in the department?\nI am mainly talking about network research but here there were people working on numerical analysis, computing, artificial intelligence ... I was just not involved in those research so i don't know much about it \n\nYou were focused on software and network..\nYes, we did produce some software. We did make software to generate compilers, there was some A.I. software in Prolog, numerical analysis  libraries... Some were sold or shared, it depends.  \nWe did sell some software since the beginning i think when it was not even a department but a professor and a couple of students.\n\nIs it when you joined ? \nNo it was already a department. I did study dutch industrial engeneering in electronics. At the time in electronics you did hear something about computers, i was interested in it i wanted to know more. I heard they had started a year before a degree in computer engeneering. It was the first year where industrial engineer could join. The only thing we knew about computer were in movies. I wanted to know how it work. I'm not sure i still know now even if maybe i have some ideas...\n\nHow many langage do you know ?\nAssembly, FORTRAN, PL-1 the langage invented by IBM to be the universal one, C, Cobol. Perl, i don't know, so more. I'm not fluent in any other langages, but i can read any langage especially well writtened, i know i can understand it and learn it...I know JAVA also. As a system administrator the thing i use most are the command line of UNIX and Perl. But that's because i'm more familiar with those two so it goes faster.\n\nHow did you see the rise of personnal computer and the software that goes with ? \nI have to admit that we missed it. We didn't see that what was new was powerful. We were not impressed by the software. I remember windows 95, the news on TV, people sleeping on the street to get it. I remember when i get my first windows version, with a box of 22 floppies or so. Then i wanted to do something, to compile a program, but there was no compiler. We were used to Unix, a basic system but with a lot of utilities in it. Software was for us free, and we were used to have it free and it was not free anymore. \n\nDoes that mean you didn't had a personnal computer until late ? \nYes. I think it was round 2000. I didn't needed it really. I got one when the belgian UCP network became commercial. Of course i did not get Windows on it.  I think we got Linux here in 1994. There was a guy involved in the kernel studying here. So we did used it very fast.\n\nSo, what is software for you ?\nFor me software is the magic that make computer usable. I can only gives examples of what i mean by it. A PC without software most people, even computer scientists, can't do anything with it. You need basic software. Some software are already integrated in the computer hardware. Same for phones, tablets... The main characteristic, for me, is that it should be user friendly. That is very difficult i know, because you have to imagine what the people using your software are going to do with it and how they want to use it, that's the magic you need to solve.\n\nIs command line user friendly ? \nWell, somehow you have to learn the command langage that is in fact a computer langage where you can make all the constructs that other langages offers.\nYou can create loops, you can test, whatever. It's not so different from computer langages like C or JAVA or whatever. \n\nBut it's already software no ? User friendly depends on what you put behind these words, no ? \nYes it's already software. I don't have a strong opinion about command lines. It depends on people. I can imagine that someone that have never heard about the command line expect that you click somewhere and it happens. But if you know the command langage it's sometimes perhaps easier or productive to type commands and let it run. Sometimes, i find it easier if i have a screen and a number of buttons and i don't have to imagine what happens behind that screen. And sometimes i want to do something with the command line, because i'm used to it. That's why i don't trust myself about user friendliness because i have a long experience in computer interfaces. I'm so used to some of them perhaps i can't even imagine that somebody else would like to do it otherwise or doesn't like what i'm used to.\n\nApart from maintaining the museum, what do you work on ? You are still active in the department even though you are retired ? \nI work on sensors, in the internet of things world in one of the university spin-off. What i do for them is sensors wireless need power, and some of them are on batteries. They have designed a complete system which should makes the battery lasts for two, three, four years. They need a system to measure that. So i been working on a mechanism to measure that without waiting four years. That's programming instrumentation computers to mesure power or whatever, that's part Unix systems. There are enough new or unknown things and maybe because i'm older, i have another way of looking at things, so we have a lot of discussions. They don't like my Pearl, they use python, JAVA those things...Pearl, it has it's disavantage, but you could do a lot of thing, each character has a meaning. With Python, you need all those libraries...It's easy when you know the libraries you have to call. When you know the arguments of the librairies...so it's also complicated. ANd if the library change for some reasons, there you go. In my humble opinion it's the same with all the langages. It's starts easy from scratch but if you have to interface them with existing thing from the internet world or whatever it gets complicated.\n\nDo you have a last word ? \nI was surprised by your group reaction to the visit. I thought all of this were known. Maybe i'm getting old :) Curently i don't do much about the museum department, but sometimes i like to talk about the little stories about it. I remember a lot of little stories, a lot of technics who have been used and forgotten and some kept alive. I thought when i was young that the best techniques would succeed. That you would have visionnary people who would see the way. But i realized that a lot of thing happens by accident.\n\n\n\n\n","attribs":"*6|1+1*0*a*b*c+1*0+t*6|1+1*5+3p*6|1+1*5+4f*6|2+2+1y*d+n+47*d+1+76*6|2+2+4n*6|1+1|1+1*5+11*6|2+2+1s*e+1+41*d+2+3a*e+k+1l*6|2+2+38*0+j+48*2+3f+2y*6|2+2+9i*d+1+14*d+1+3j*6|2+2+6i*d+8+15*6|2+2*5+1a*6|2+2+1b*d+1+1u*d+6+1y*6|2+2*5+19*6|2+2+2p*d+1+3f*d+a+o*d+1+1b*d+1+2*d+l+9*d+2a+1*e+14+19*d+1+1b*d+u+1*6|2+2*5+1r*6|2+2+d*d+4+1e*d+1+1v*d+a+9*d+1+1*d+1+r*d+u+1*d+n+e*d*e+4*e+8+1t*d+1+2*d+1+s*d+4+h*d|1+1+2r*d+9+1l*0+1+2s*d+3+33*6|1+1+41*6|2+2*5+1a*6|2+2+4h*d+4+x*6|2+2*5+2w*6|2+2+7u*d+4+q*d+9+f*d|1+1+f*d+1+27*d+1+7*d+1+9*d+1+t*d+2+w*d+6+e*d+e+2*d+2+r*d+m+g*d+9+q*e+i*d+1+3q*6|2+2*5+1f*6|2+2+43*0+1+f*0+2+4*d+a*e+3+1h*d+p+z*d+3+3z*d+1+10*d+4+5*d+3+1n*d+6+r*d+4+f*d+1+1o*d+1+j*d+c+17*d+h+8*d+11+p*0+33+1k*d+2+3f*d+4+1*6|1+1+x*0+f+1*0+12+1*0*2+1*0+37+2q*0+4+2*0|1+21*0+1f+1v*0+1+1*0*2+1*0+fh*d|1+1*d+1+1j*d+a+1z*0+1*d|1+1+m*d+2+4*d+5+a*d+7+8o*0|2+2*5+1v*0|1+1+3y*0+4+6i*0|2+2*5+5m*0|1+1+30*0|1+1+48*2+15+9l*0|1+1+1*0|1+1+1*5+1y*0|1+1+tm*0|1+1+1*0|1+1*5+4t*0|1+1+dr*0|1+1+u6*0|2+2*5+x*0|1+1+5q*0|2+2*5+1q*0|1+1+5w*0|2+2*5+16*0|1+1+5b*0|1+1+3l*0|2+2*5+o*0|1+1+df*0|2+2*5+u*0|1+1+bs*0|2+2*5+29*0|1+1+eh*0|2+2*5+1s*0|1+1+7m*0|2+2*5+u*0|1+1+fk*0|2+2*5+w*0|1+1+48*0|1+1+3b*0|2+2*5+2m*0|1+1+m9*0|2+2*5+3i*0|1+1+xt*0|2+2*5+q*0|1+1+eh*0|1+1*6|3+3|1+1"}}},"pad:observatory.guide.jeanhuensitvextended:revs:8301":{"changeset":"Z:etl>2|1c=6ac=1e*d+2$et","meta":{"author":"a.T2VW9Z1FoOo412v8","timestamp":1518187620557}},"pad:observatory.guide.jeanhuensitvextended:revs:8302":{"changeset":"Z:etn>1|1c=6ac=1g*d+1$i","meta":{"author":"a.T2VW9Z1FoOo412v8","timestamp":1518187621048}},"pad:observatory.guide.jeanhuensitvextended:revs:8303":{"changeset":"Z:eto>1|1c=6ac=1h*d+1$c","meta":{"author":"a.T2VW9Z1FoOo412v8","timestamp":1518187621720}},"pad:observatory.guide.jeanhuensitvextended:revs:8304":{"changeset":"Z:etp>1|1c=6ac=1i*d+1$

Huens interview extended\n**You have been using computers since a long time, as you explained us during the tour we had the joy of assisting during the TGSO.**\n**I heard that that until recently, let's say the late 1990's, when learning computer programming you had to start by  writing down the program on paper... ** \n\nIn 1973, i did study computer sciences, it was the second year of the Computer Sciense course, here in Leuven. At the time computers were mainframes and you did fed them with programms by punch cards. Programing was writing down the program, then you punched it and the next day you get results, mostly error. That's the way it worked at that time. To teach us programing, they used the langage of that time, Fortran and some kind of invented assembly langage, it didn't really exist, it was simplified.\n\nMost of the time you did write down your program, the teacher and the assistant would have to tell you what is wrong or good, you didn't had much practical experience.\n\n**How was it like, tons of pages ?** \n\nNo. As an anecdocte, i remember punchcards were a block of papers, we were jealous of the people who came in the computer center with huge stacks of cards. That were really small programs, not complicated one. In fact you had to learn to use the computer from scratch, everything was new, you couldn't rely on previous experiences, everything was new. And to start with small programs was difficult enough. \n\nThat was also the time when Edsger W. Dijkstra, who faught against the goto and other then common but bad constructs [@[text:1972:goto]. I still remember him, in an audience, giving us a lecture on good  techniques  in programming at the  International computing symposium 1977 in Liège (programming:  from craft to scientific discipline https://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/EWD/transcriptions/EWD05xx/EWD566.html). It was a rather hard course because Dijkstra expected you to quickly  understand and implement his ideas.\n\nAnd then from 75 on, computers became cheaper and could be bought by departments and smaller entities. And than came the first interactive computer. Still beasts about two cubic meters, costing two millions belgian francs. But it was low enough to allow people to type in directly commands. I started working here in 75 as a researcher, it has evolved continuously and i saw computers getting cheaper and getting easier to use.The way to use it was simplified, you could start to go to the beast and try it out.\n\nI remember more or less: you did write down the program in Fortran for instance… We always thought in the beginning that it would work and it didn't, so after a turn around you were giving it back to the operator and you have to wait another half a day or a night to get the results.\n\n**What kind of program you were working on?** \n\nI remember the first program i had to write was: you got three numbers, you had to make the program decide if you could construct a triangle with the numbers being the sides of the triangle.\n\n**That took an afternoon to be processed ?** \n\nWell, yeah. You had to imagine how to do it which was also one problem, than you prepare the cards with the punching machine and you give the package of cards to the operator who was feeeding the computer with the cards. Operator people had the taks to feed the computers by hands, with paper, cards, then cards got written on disks and later processed by the mainframe from disk. Finally results got printed on paper. it lasts onto the magnetic disks period. And after a number of hours or a night you got a listing, a piece of paper, with the results or program compilation errors.\n\n**When where you able to record the program onto the machine?**\n\nI think that did happen between 75 and 80. After the punching cards, which was already a way to record the program, we had  typewriters and then terminals. We could record the programs by typing it on the terminal  and the computer would store them on disk. We had magnetic discs. IBM had number for everything, i remember the 3300  [manufactured from 1970 on] was a magnetic disk. \nWe didn't touch the machines, operators would change the disks, we could only access the typewriter/terminal. That was our most direct connexion to the computer. The times were diffent. The mainframes were such huge costly beasts that it had operators day and night to keep it busy. Even at night there were two or three guys mounting tapes, dismounting tapes, that kind of stuff.\nhttps://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/42/IBM_magnetic_disk_drives_3330%2B3333.png/600px-IBM_magnetic_disk_drives_3330%2B3333.png\n\n**When did you stop working with operators?** \n\nSomewhere between 85 and 90. There were still operators at the main computer of the university, but there were also small computers, so researchers and student could have direct access when needed. \n\n**When did you start to work with software sold by others or gived away in order to do your research?** \n\nYou stil need an operating system on the mainframe that was delivered by IBM or the constructor delivering the mainframe. When you bought mini-computers, which were the  smaller versions of mainframes, in most cases you did buy an operating systems, compilers and all the stuff you did need to be able to program or work  those things. \nIn most cases,  the computer sciences department did buy the mini-computer from, for instance *Digital Equipment Corporation*,  a manufactorer at that time, but they didn't buy DEC's  software. The DEC software  was not open source or free,  and as a university we could get Unix for free and could run it on those digital equipment  DEC computers. That is what the computer department of the University of Louvain la Neuve *l'unité d'informatique*, did and so did we.\n\n**When did you start working with unix as an os?** \n\nI took a trip to Amsterdam, it must have been in 1979/80… Well, the story starts in our french sister university (LLN) where they did have a PDP-11 with Unix on it. You could get got Unix, at the time, when you were a university, from Bell Labs ( part of AT&T ), the american telephone company. ATT was a mega organisation at the time [before the [dismantlment of AT&T/Bell system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breakup_of_the_Bell_System)]. Due to monopoly, the US authorities did split it up in different Baby Bells. One of the restriction was that the  research baby bell,  could not sell anything. There were computer scientists there, who did developped some interesting things (e.g. Unix).  For universities you did get the source for free, but NO  support, nothing not even how to install it. In Unité d'informatique, where they had a PDP-11/70 https://i0.wp.com/www.utterpower.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/pdp11-70-panel.jpg  they were lucky: they got the same computer that unix was developped on.  They got the disk by snail mail as a post-office package. They mounted it and it did spin up and they had UNIX.\nHere, we did have a cheaper PDP11, the PDP 11/60  (https://dave.cheney.net/tag/pdp-11). We got the Unix disk distribution from Bell Labs but we could not run it, because we got another type of disk(RK07). We could look at it but that was all, because our disc format was different than the one at Bell Labs. Somebody here (P.Verbaeten) did write a driver for that disk in l'unité \nd'informatique of LLN. But they did not have a RK07.  it did compile it but we couldn't try it because we did not have. The nearest place  with Unix and RK07 was in Vrije Universiteit  Amsterdam.  Andrew Tenebaum, who did write a number of books on operating systems, was working there. He was learning to speak dutch. We did understood his english better but his assistant explained that he needed to practice speaking Dutch because he would have to pass an exam. There we compiled Unix with an RK07 driver and stored it on a bootable RK07 disk. With that disk back in Leuven we could start  Unix on our PDP11/60. An error in the process meant a trip Leuven-Amsterdam and back.\nIn my opinion the start of open source was Unix because everybody  had to maintain it by ourselves and we learned a lot from the sources. \nIn that time for software distribution you did have to store it on magnetic tape and send the tape us to different places with associated problems. For example,  the agents at the customs at the airport or post didn't know what to do with the tapes or discs in terms of custom clearance. They used magnetic or xrays as inspection tools and  we had to write on the package that it should not be x-rayed. and sometimes we time to time unreadable discs. \n\n**So it took like weeks between the transportation, the custom...**\nYes, the custom had to clear the packages. I remember i've been in the customs in Zaventem. I had received a letter that my package from Bell Labs had arrived. I went there thinking i would have to pay something and go. But no. It had to be cleared so there wa some organisation that had to do administrative stuff, so i only got it a few days later. The response time was huge :)\n\n**Than after that period of time how did you switch from that kind of collaboration on how to make software and make software work to collaboration on networks, between universities and researchers...**\nIn the Unix system of that time there was a kind of networking protocol which only did work on serial lines.\n You could connect two unix systems together you only need a line. We had one between LLN and Leuven, it's only 15 kms, but we had to ask Belgacom, than La Régie des télégraphes et téléphones, to get a modem to connect through their network and than over that modem you could reach an amazing speed of 300 characters per second. And that was the first communication. It did happened somewhere around 85. And then you had connexion with another computer, writing something here and do  something. And we could send programs to each other. \n \n **What was the first thing you did send through a network like this?**\n I didn't do it myself, i remember it was a kind of chat program. And on LLN side was Elie Milgrom, he is retired now. On this side, it was Pr Willems. And i remember that they typed something and they got a response from the other side and that was it.  But i remember that Pr Willems sent \"ok we stop now\". And that Elie Milgrom answered \"See you later, Alligator\" [a reference to Bill Haley and the Comets].  At the time we still had these kind of songs in mind. (lol). Those Unix to Unix connexions were first. And there was a worldwide Unix to Unix based network, Usenet (1979), it still exists somewhere... you can download load  of illegal movies and that stuff, that was not what we meant at the time. But that is what is left. And Usenet became gradually replaced by the Internet in USA. In Europe, the Internet came a lot later, but we had access to the Internet, we could send mail to them and we could receive mail from them, because some friendly american university, later companies, did translate internet mail to UCP mail. That was before the 1990's.\n \n **Your relation to software had changed at the time because you did not have to do all this manipulations with the software your received... Was it already floppy discs ?**\n No, magnetic tapes, for the mainframe at least. Most of the mini-computers had some cheaper magnetic tapes. Between 90 and 95 the main machines for the software institute was a VAX from DEC. Once a year the software came from Berkeley, it was still Unix but modified by Berkeley for virtual memory and all the stuff which are common now. We received a tape, with lot of goodies, i still remember we didn't know what was on there but we scrutinised there to know what was there, what we can use.\nIn Europe, companies like Siemens were trying to set up software centers to make software avaiable, they were even trying to set up networks. Researchers did love the Internet, it worked, it was useful for their researchs. So companies in Europe, were trying to set up their own networks, i remember for example the X/OPEN transport protocol. Their was a lot of standards about what software layers should do, but it didn't succeed because sometime, 92 maybe, IBM decided to quit their own private network and to go forTCP/IP and was the switching point. Everything done for X/OPEN were suddently forgotten. For the mainframes, and certainly in Belgium computing was mainly mainframes, i'm talking about universities here, so when IBM decided to go for TCP/IP we followed even though things were really slow. For example, Belgacom was not interested in running the Domain Name System so we did it here, for some time, starting in 1993 with Pierre Verbaten (https://www.dnsbelgium.be/en/history). Belgacom were focused on X25 (DCS - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X.25) so they missed it.\n\nIt was like the french Minitel ? \nWell, at that time we were really jealous about Minitel. Could you imagine that? Terminals?  At home ? You could work home with a computer ! You could send emails ! All in one, a pc computer with a modem ! \n\nHow did the research about software evolved in the department?\nI am mainly talking about network research but here there were people working on numerical analysis, computing, artificial intelligence ... I was just not involved in those research so i don't know much about it \n\nYou were focused on software and network..\nYes, we did produce some software. We did make software to generate compilers, there was some A.I. software in Prolog, numerical analysis  libraries... Some were sold or shared, it depends.  \nWe did sell some software since the beginning i think when it was not even a department but a professor and a couple of students.\n\nIs it when you joined ? \nNo it was already a department. I did study dutch industrial engeneering in electronics. At the time in electronics you did hear something about computers, i was interested in it i wanted to know more. I heard they had started a year before a degree in computer engeneering. It was the first year where industrial engineer could join. The only thing we knew about computer were in movies. I wanted to know how it work. I'm not sure i still know now even if maybe i have some ideas...\n\nHow many langage do you know ?\nAssembly, FORTRAN, PL-1 the langage invented by IBM to be the universal one, C, Cobol. Perl, i don't know, so more. I'm not fluent in any other langages, but i can read any langage especially well writtened, i know i can understand it and learn it...I know JAVA also. As a system administrator the thing i use most are the command line of UNIX and Perl. But that's because i'm more familiar with those two so it goes faster.\n\nHow did you see the rise of personnal computer and the software that goes with ? \nI have to admit that we missed it. We didn't see that what was new was powerful. We were not impressed by the software. I remember windows 95, the news on TV, people sleeping on the street to get it. I remember when i get my first windows version, with a box of 22 floppies or so. Then i wanted to do something, to compile a program, but there was no compiler. We were used to Unix, a basic system but with a lot of utilities in it. Software was for us free, and we were used to have it free and it was not free anymore. \n\nDoes that mean you didn't had a personnal computer until late ? \nYes. I think it was round 2000. I didn't needed it really. I got one when the belgian UCP network became commercial. Of course i did not get Windows on it.  I think we got Linux here in 1994. There was a guy involved in the kernel studying here. So we did used it very fast.\n\nSo, what is software for you ?\nFor me software is the magic that make computer usable. I can only gives examples of what i mean by it. A PC without software most people, even computer scientists, can't do anything with it. You need basic software. Some software are already integrated in the computer hardware. Same for phones, tablets... The main characteristic, for me, is that it should be user friendly. That is very difficult i know, because you have to imagine what the people using your software are going to do with it and how they want to use it, that's the magic you need to solve.\n\nIs command line user friendly ? \nWell, somehow you have to learn the command langage that is in fact a computer langage where you can make all the constructs that other langages offers.\nYou can create loops, you can test, whatever. It's not so different from computer langages like C or JAVA or whatever. \n\nBut it's already software no ? User friendly depends on what you put behind these words, no ? \nYes it's already software. I don't have a strong opinion about command lines. It depends on people. I can imagine that someone that have never heard about the command line expect that you click somewhere and it happens. But if you know the command langage it's sometimes perhaps easier or productive to type commands and let it run. Sometimes, i find it easier if i have a screen and a number of buttons and i don't have to imagine what happens behind that screen. And sometimes i want to do something with the command line, because i'm used to it. That's why i don't trust myself about user friendliness because i have a long experience in computer interfaces. I'm so used to some of them perhaps i can't even imagine that somebody else would like to do it otherwise or doesn't like what i'm used to.\n\nApart from maintaining the museum, what do you work on ? You are still active in the department even though you are retired ? \nI work on sensors, in the internet of things world in one of the university spin-off. What i do for them is sensors wireless need power, and some of them are on batteries. They have designed a complete system which should makes the battery lasts for two, three, four years. They need a system to measure that. So i been working on a mechanism to measure that without waiting four years. That's programming instrumentation computers to mesure power or whatever, that's part Unix systems. There are enough new or unknown things and maybe because i'm older, i have another way of looking at things, so we have a lot of discussions. They don't like my Pearl, they use python, JAVA those things...Pearl, it has it's disavantage, but you could do a lot of thing, each character has a meaning. With Python, you need all those libraries...It's easy when you know the libraries you have to call. When you know the arguments of the librairies...so it's also complicated. ANd if the library change for some reasons, there you go. In my humble opinion it's the same with all the langages. It's starts easy from scratch but if you have to interface them with existing thing from the internet world or whatever it gets complicated.\n\nDo you have a last word ? \nI was surprised by your group reaction to the visit. I thought all of this were known. Maybe i'm getting old :) Curently i don't do much about the museum department, but sometimes i like to talk about the little stories about it. I remember a lot of little stories, a lot of technics who have been used and forgotten and some kept alive. I thought when i was young that the best techniques would succeed. That you would have visionnary people who would see the way. But i realized that a lot of thing happens by accident.\n\n\n\n\n","attribs":"*6|1+1*0*a*b*c+1*0+t*6|1+1*5+3p*6|1+1*5+4f*6|2+2+1y*d+n+47*d+1+76*6|2+2+4n*6|1+1|1+1*5+11*6|2+2+1s*e+1+41*d+2+3a*e+k+1l*6|2+2+38*0+j+48*2+3f+2y*6|2+2+9i*d+1+14*d+1+3j*6|2+2+6i*d+8+15*6|2+2*5+1a*6|2+2+1b*d+1+1u*d+6+1y*6|2+2*5+19*6|2+2+2p*d+1+3f*d+a+o*d+1+1b*d+1+2*d+l+9*d+2a+1*e+14+19*d+1+1b*d+u+1*6|2+2*5+1r*6|2+2+d*d+4+1e*d+1+1v*d+a+9*d+1+1*d+1+r*d+u+1*d+n+e*d*e+4*e+8+1t*d+1+2*d+1+s*d+4+h*d|1+1+2r*d+9+1l*0+1+2s*d+3+33*6|1+1+41*6|2+2*5+1a*6|2+2+4h*d+4+x*6|2+2*5+2w*6|2+2+7u*d+4+q*d+9+f*d|1+1+f*d+1+27*d+1+7*d+1+9*d+1+t*d+2+w*d+6+e*d+e+2*d+2+r*d+m+g*d+9+q*e+i*d+1+3q*6|2+2*5+1f*6|2+2+43*0+1+f*0+2+4*d+a*e+3+1h*d+p+z*d+3+3z*d+1+10*d+4+5*d+3+1n*d+6+r*d+4+f*d+1+1o*d+1+j*d+c+17*d+h+8*d+11+p*0+33+1k*d+2+3f*d+4+1*6|1+1+x*0+f+1*0+12+1*0*2+1*0+37+2q*0+4+2*0|1+21*0+1f+1v*0+1+1*0*2+1*0+fh*d|1+1*d+1+1j*d+a+1z*0+1*d|1+1+d*d+t+7*d+2+4*d+5+1*d+2+1*d+l+1*d+c+n*d+p+14*d+1+1k*d+9+1r*d+p+1r*d+g+w*0|2+2*5+1v*0|1+1+3y*0+4+6i*0|2+2*5+5m*0|1+1+30*0|1+1+48*2+15+9l*0|1+1+1*0|1+1+1*5+1y*0|1+1+tm*0|1+1+1*0|1+1*5+4t*0|1+1+dr*0|1+1+u6*0|2+2*5+x*0|1+1+5q*0|2+2*5+1q*0|1+1+5w*0|2+2*5+16*0|1+1+5b*0|1+1+3l*0|2+2*5+o*0|1+1+df*0|2+2*5+u*0|1+1+bs*0|2+2*5+29*0|1+1+eh*0|2+2*5+1s*0|1+1+7m*0|2+2*5+u*0|1+1+fk*0|2+2*5+w*0|1+1+48*0|1+1+3b*0|2+2*5+2m*0|1+1+m9*0|2+2*5+3i*0|1+1+xt*0|2+2*5+q*0|1+1+eh*0|1+1*6|3+3|1+1"}}},"pad:observatory.guide.jeanhuensitvextended:revs:8401":{"changeset":"Z:ew2>3|1c=6ac=bn*d+3$

Huens interview extended\n**You have been using computers since a long time, as you explained us during the tour we had the joy of assisting during the TGSO.**\n**I heard that that until recently, let's say the late 1990's, when learning computer programming you had to start by  writing down the program on paper... ** \n\nIn 1973, i did study computer sciences, it was the second year of the Computer Sciense course, here in Leuven. At the time computers were mainframes and you did fed them with programms by punch cards. Programing was writing down the program, then you punched it and the next day you get results, mostly error. That's the way it worked at that time. To teach us programing, they used the langage of that time, Fortran and some kind of invented assembly langage, it didn't really exist, it was simplified.\n\nMost of the time you did write down your program, the teacher and the assistant would have to tell you what is wrong or good, you didn't had much practical experience.\n\n**How was it like, tons of pages ?** \n\nNo. As an anecdocte, i remember punchcards were a block of papers, we were jealous of the people who came in the computer center with huge stacks of cards. That were really small programs, not complicated one. In fact you had to learn to use the computer from scratch, everything was new, you couldn't rely on previous experiences, everything was new. And to start with small programs was difficult enough. \n\nThat was also the time when Edsger W. Dijkstra, who faught against the goto and other then common but bad constructs [@[text:1972:goto]. I still remember him, in an audience, giving us a lecture on good  techniques  in programming at the  International computing symposium 1977 in Liège (programming:  from craft to scientific discipline https://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/EWD/transcriptions/EWD05xx/EWD566.html). It was a rather hard course because Dijkstra expected you to quickly  understand and implement his ideas.\n\nAnd then from 75 on, computers became cheaper and could be bought by departments and smaller entities. And than came the first interactive computer. Still beasts about two cubic meters, costing two millions belgian francs. But it was low enough to allow people to type in directly commands. I started working here in 75 as a researcher, it has evolved continuously and i saw computers getting cheaper and getting easier to use.The way to use it was simplified, you could start to go to the beast and try it out.\n\nI remember more or less: you did write down the program in Fortran for instance… We always thought in the beginning that it would work and it didn't, so after a turn around you were giving it back to the operator and you have to wait another half a day or a night to get the results.\n\n**What kind of program you were working on?** \n\nI remember the first program i had to write was: you got three numbers, you had to make the program decide if you could construct a triangle with the numbers being the sides of the triangle.\n\n**That took an afternoon to be processed ?** \n\nWell, yeah. You had to imagine how to do it which was also one problem, than you prepare the cards with the punching machine and you give the package of cards to the operator who was feeeding the computer with the cards. Operator people had the taks to feed the computers by hands, with paper, cards, then cards got written on disks and later processed by the mainframe from disk. Finally results got printed on paper. it lasts onto the magnetic disks period. And after a number of hours or a night you got a listing, a piece of paper, with the results or program compilation errors.\n\n**When where you able to record the program onto the machine?**\n\nI think that did happen between 75 and 80. After the punching cards, which was already a way to record the program, we had  typewriters and then terminals. We could record the programs by typing it on the terminal  and the computer would store them on disk. We had magnetic discs. IBM had number for everything, i remember the 3300  [manufactured from 1970 on] was a magnetic disk. \nWe didn't touch the machines, operators would change the disks, we could only access the typewriter/terminal. That was our most direct connexion to the computer. The times were diffent. The mainframes were such huge costly beasts that it had operators day and night to keep it busy. Even at night there were two or three guys mounting tapes, dismounting tapes, that kind of stuff.\nhttps://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/42/IBM_magnetic_disk_drives_3330%2B3333.png/600px-IBM_magnetic_disk_drives_3330%2B3333.png\n\n**When did you stop working with operators?** \n\nSomewhere between 85 and 90. There were still operators at the main computer of the university, but there were also small computers, so researchers and student could have direct access when needed. \n\n**When did you start to work with software sold by others or gived away in order to do your research?** \n\nYou stil need an operating system on the mainframe that was delivered by IBM or the constructor delivering the mainframe. When you bought mini-computers, which were the  smaller versions of mainframes, in most cases you did buy an operating systems, compilers and all the stuff you did need to be able to program or work  those things. \nIn most cases,  the computer sciences department did buy the mini-computer from, for instance *Digital Equipment Corporation*,  a manufactorer at that time, but they didn't buy DEC's  software. The DEC software  was not open source or free,  and as a university we could get Unix for free and could run it on those digital equipment  DEC computers. That is what the computer department of the University of Louvain la Neuve *l'unité d'informatique*, did and so did we.\n\n**When did you start working with unix as an os?** \n\nI took a trip to Amsterdam, it must have been in 1979/80… Well, the story starts in our french sister university (LLN) where they did have a PDP-11 with Unix on it. You could get got Unix, at the time, when you were a university, from Bell Labs ( part of AT&T ), the american telephone company. ATT was a mega organisation at the time [before the [dismantlment of AT&T/Bell system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breakup_of_the_Bell_System)]. Due to monopoly, the US authorities did split it up in different Baby Bells. One of the restriction was that the  research baby bell,  could not sell anything. There were computer scientists there, who did developped some interesting things (e.g. Unix).  For universities you did get the source for free, but NO  support, nothing not even how to install it. In Unité d'informatique, where they had a PDP-11/70 https://i0.wp.com/www.utterpower.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/pdp11-70-panel.jpg  they were lucky: they got the same computer that unix was developped on.  They got the disk by snail mail as a post-office package. They mounted it and it did spin up and they had UNIX.\nHere, we did have a cheaper PDP11, the PDP 11/60  (https://dave.cheney.net/tag/pdp-11). We got the Unix disk distribution from Bell Labs but we could not run it, because we got another type of disk(RK07). We could look at it but that was all, because our disc format was different than the one at Bell Labs. Somebody here (P.Verbaeten) did write a driver for that disk in l'unité \nd'informatique of LLN. But they did not have a RK07.  it did compile it but we couldn't try it because we did not have. The nearest place  with Unix and RK07 was in Vrije Universiteit  Amsterdam.  Andrew Tenebaum, who did write a number of books on operating systems, was working there. He was learning to speak dutch. We did understood his english better but his assistant explained that he needed to practice speaking Dutch because he would have to pass an exam. There we compiled Unix with an RK07 driver and stored it on a bootable RK07 disk. With that disk back in Leuven we could start  Unix on our PDP11/60. An error in the process meant a trip Leuven-Amsterdam and back.\nIn my opinion the start of open source was Unix because everybody  had to maintain it by ourselves and we learned a lot from the sources. \nIn that time for software distribution you did have to store it on magnetic tape and send the tape us to different places with associated problems. For example,  the agents at the customs at the airport or post didn't know what to do with the tapes or discs in terms of custom clearance. They used magnetic or xrays as inspection tools and  we had to write on the package that it should not be x-rayed. and sometimes we still got unreadable tapes/discs. \n\n**So it took like weeks between the transportation, the custom...**\nYes, the custom had to clear the packages. I remember i've been in the customs in Zaventem. I had received a letter that my package from Bell Labs had arrived. I went there thinking i would have to pay something and go. But no. It had to be cleared so there wa some organisation that had to do administrative stuff, so i only got it a few days later. The response time was huge :)\n\n**Than after that period of time how did you switch from that kind of collaboration on how to make software and make software work to collaboration on networks, between universities and researchers...**\nIn the Unix systems at that time there was a kind of networking protocol which did work on serial lines (UUCP).\n To connect two unix systems together you only need a serial line . We had a line between LLN and Leuven, it's only 25 kms, but we had to ask Belgacom, then La Régie des Télégraphes et Téléphones, to get a modem to connect through their network and than over that modem you could reach an amazing speed of 300 characters per second. And that was the first communication. It did happened somewhere around 85. And then you had connexion with another computer, writing something here and do the transfer to the other computer and execute it ther And we could send programs to each other. \n \n **What was the first thing you did send through a network like this?**\n I didn't do it myself, i remember it was a kind of chat program. And on LLN side was Elie Milgrom, he is retired now. On this side, it was Pr Willems. And i remember that they typed something and they got a response from the other side and that was it.  But i remember that Pr Willems sent \"ok we stop now\". And that Elie Milgrom answered \"See you later, Alligator\" [a reference to Bill Haley and the Comets].  At the time we still had these kind of songs in mind. (lol). Those Unix to Unix connexions were first. And there was a worldwide Unix to Unix based network, Usenet (1979), it still exists somewhere... you can download load  of illegal movies and that stuff, that was not what we meant at the time. But that is what is left. And Usenet became gradually replaced by the Internet in USA. In Europe, the Internet came a lot later, but we had access to the Internet, we could send mail to them and we could receive mail from them, because some friendly american university, later companies, did translate internet mail to UCP mail. That was before the 1990's.\n \n **Your relation to software had changed at the time because you did not have to do all this manipulations with the software your received... Was it already floppy discs ?**\n No, magnetic tapes, for the mainframe at least. Most of the mini-computers had some cheaper magnetic tapes. Between 90 and 95 the main machines for the software institute was a VAX from DEC. Once a year the software came from Berkeley, it was still Unix but modified by Berkeley for virtual memory and all the stuff which are common now. We received a tape, with lot of goodies, i still remember we didn't know what was on there but we scrutinised there to know what was there, what we can use.\nIn Europe, companies like Siemens were trying to set up software centers to make software avaiable, they were even trying to set up networks. Researchers did love the Internet, it worked, it was useful for their researchs. So companies in Europe, were trying to set up their own networks, i remember for example the X/OPEN transport protocol. Their was a lot of standards about what software layers should do, but it didn't succeed because sometime, 92 maybe, IBM decided to quit their own private network and to go forTCP/IP and was the switching point. Everything done for X/OPEN were suddently forgotten. For the mainframes, and certainly in Belgium computing was mainly mainframes, i'm talking about universities here, so when IBM decided to go for TCP/IP we followed even though things were really slow. For example, Belgacom was not interested in running the Domain Name System so we did it here, for some time, starting in 1993 with Pierre Verbaten (https://www.dnsbelgium.be/en/history). Belgacom were focused on X25 (DCS - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X.25) so they missed it.\n\nIt was like the french Minitel ? \nWell, at that time we were really jealous about Minitel. Could you imagine that? Terminals?  At home ? You could work home with a computer ! You could send emails ! All in one, a pc computer with a modem ! \n\nHow did the research about software evolved in the department?\nI am mainly talking about network research but here there were people working on numerical analysis, computing, artificial intelligence ... I was just not involved in those research so i don't know much about it \n\nYou were focused on software and network..\nYes, we did produce some software. We did make software to generate compilers, there was some A.I. software in Prolog, numerical analysis  libraries... Some were sold or shared, it depends.  \nWe did sell some software since the beginning i think when it was not even a department but a professor and a couple of students.\n\nIs it when you joined ? \nNo it was already a department. I did study dutch industrial engeneering in electronics. At the time in electronics you did hear something about computers, i was interested in it i wanted to know more. I heard they had started a year before a degree in computer engeneering. It was the first year where industrial engineer could join. The only thing we knew about computer were in movies. I wanted to know how it work. I'm not sure i still know now even if maybe i have some ideas...\n\nHow many langage do you know ?\nAssembly, FORTRAN, PL-1 the langage invented by IBM to be the universal one, C, Cobol. Perl, i don't know, so more. I'm not fluent in any other langages, but i can read any langage especially well writtened, i know i can understand it and learn it...I know JAVA also. As a system administrator the thing i use most are the command line of UNIX and Perl. But that's because i'm more familiar with those two so it goes faster.\n\nHow did you see the rise of personnal computer and the software that goes with ? \nI have to admit that we missed it. We didn't see that what was new was powerful. We were not impressed by the software. I remember windows 95, the news on TV, people sleeping on the street to get it. I remember when i get my first windows version, with a box of 22 floppies or so. Then i wanted to do something, to compile a program, but there was no compiler. We were used to Unix, a basic system but with a lot of utilities in it. Software was for us free, and we were used to have it free and it was not free anymore. \n\nDoes that mean you didn't had a personnal computer until late ? \nYes. I think it was round 2000. I didn't needed it really. I got one when the belgian UCP network became commercial. Of course i did not get Windows on it.  I think we got Linux here in 1994. There was a guy involved in the kernel studying here. So we did used it very fast.\n\nSo, what is software for you ?\nFor me software is the magic that make computer usable. I can only gives examples of what i mean by it. A PC without software most people, even computer scientists, can't do anything with it. You need basic software. Some software are already integrated in the computer hardware. Same for phones, tablets... The main characteristic, for me, is that it should be user friendly. That is very difficult i know, because you have to imagine what the people using your software are going to do with it and how they want to use it, that's the magic you need to solve.\n\nIs command line user friendly ? \nWell, somehow you have to learn the command langage that is in fact a computer langage where you can make all the constructs that other langages offers.\nYou can create loops, you can test, whatever. It's not so different from computer langages like C or JAVA or whatever. \n\nBut it's already software no ? User friendly depends on what you put behind these words, no ? \nYes it's already software. I don't have a strong opinion about command lines. It depends on people. I can imagine that someone that have never heard about the command line expect that you click somewhere and it happens. But if you know the command langage it's sometimes perhaps easier or productive to type commands and let it run. Sometimes, i find it easier if i have a screen and a number of buttons and i don't have to imagine what happens behind that screen. And sometimes i want to do something with the command line, because i'm used to it. That's why i don't trust myself about user friendliness because i have a long experience in computer interfaces. I'm so used to some of them perhaps i can't even imagine that somebody else would like to do it otherwise or doesn't like what i'm used to.\n\nApart from maintaining the museum, what do you work on ? You are still active in the department even though you are retired ? \nI work on sensors, in the internet of things world in one of the university spin-off. What i do for them is sensors wireless need power, and some of them are on batteries. They have designed a complete system which should makes the battery lasts for two, three, four years. They need a system to measure that. So i been working on a mechanism to measure that without waiting four years. That's programming instrumentation computers to mesure power or whatever, that's part Unix systems. There are enough new or unknown things and maybe because i'm older, i have another way of looking at things, so we have a lot of discussions. They don't like my Pearl, they use python, JAVA those things...Pearl, it has it's disavantage, but you could do a lot of thing, each character has a meaning. With Python, you need all those libraries...It's easy when you know the libraries you have to call. When you know the arguments of the librairies...so it's also complicated. ANd if the library change for some reasons, there you go. In my humble opinion it's the same with all the langages. It's starts easy from scratch but if you have to interface them with existing thing from the internet world or whatever it gets complicated.\n\nDo you have a last word ? \nI was surprised by your group reaction to the visit. I thought all of this were known. Maybe i'm getting old :) Curently i don't do much about the museum department, but sometimes i like to talk about the little stories about it. I remember a lot of little stories, a lot of technics who have been used and forgotten and some kept alive. I thought when i was young that the best techniques would succeed. That you would have visionnary people who would see the way. But i realized that a lot of thing happens by accident.\n\n\n\n\n","attribs":"*6|1+1*0*a*b*c+1*0+t*6|1+1*5+3p*6|1+1*5+4f*6|2+2+1y*d+n+47*d+1+76*6|2+2+4n*6|1+1|1+1*5+11*6|2+2+1s*e+1+41*d+2+3a*e+k+1l*6|2+2+38*0+j+48*2+3f+2y*6|2+2+9i*d+1+14*d+1+3j*6|2+2+6i*d+8+15*6|2+2*5+1a*6|2+2+1b*d+1+1u*d+6+1y*6|2+2*5+19*6|2+2+2p*d+1+3f*d+a+o*d+1+1b*d+1+2*d+l+9*d+2a+1*e+14+19*d+1+1b*d+u+1*6|2+2*5+1r*6|2+2+d*d+4+1e*d+1+1v*d+a+9*d+1+1*d+1+r*d+u+1*d+n+e*d*e+4*e+8+1t*d+1+2*d+1+s*d+4+h*d|1+1+2r*d+9+1l*0+1+2s*d+3+33*6|1+1+41*6|2+2*5+1a*6|2+2+4h*d+4+x*6|2+2*5+2w*6|2+2+7u*d+4+q*d+9+f*d|1+1+f*d+1+27*d+1+7*d+1+9*d+1+t*d+2+w*d+6+e*d+e+2*d+2+r*d+m+g*d+9+q*e+i*d+1+3q*6|2+2*5+1f*6|2+2+43*0+1+f*0+2+4*d+a*e+3+1h*d+p+z*d+3+3z*d+1+10*d+4+5*d+3+1n*d+6+r*d+4+f*d+1+1o*d+1+j*d+c+17*d+h+8*d+11+p*0+33+1k*d+2+3f*d+4+1*6|1+1+x*0+f+1*0+12+1*0*2+1*0+37+2q*0+4+2*0|1+21*0+1f+1v*0+1+1*0*2+1*0+fh*d|1+1*d+1+1j*d+a+1z*0+1*d|1+1+d*d+t+7*d+2+4*d+5+1*d+2+1*d+l+1*d+c+n*d+p+14*d+1+1k*d+9+1r*d+p+1r*d+q+c*d+6+7*0|2+2*5+1v*0|1+1+3y*0+4+6i*0|2+2*5+5m*0|1+1+i*d+1+1*d+2+29*d+7+1*0|1+1+1*d+2+1f*d+7+4*d+1+9*d+6+z*d+1+11*d+1+1*2+e*d*2+1*2+e*d*2+1*2+b+83*d+1i+17*0|1+1+1*0|1+1+1*5+1y*0|1+1+tm*0|1+1+1*0|1+1*5+4t*0|1+1+dr*0|1+1+u6*0|2+2*5+x*0|1+1+5q*0|2+2*5+1q*0|1+1+5w*0|2+2*5+16*0|1+1+5b*0|1+1+3l*0|2+2*5+o*0|1+1+df*0|2+2*5+u*0|1+1+bs*0|2+2*5+29*0|1+1+eh*0|2+2*5+1s*0|1+1+7m*0|2+2*5+u*0|1+1+fk*0|2+2*5+w*0|1+1+48*0|1+1+3b*0|2+2*5+2m*0|1+1+m9*0|2+2*5+3i*0|1+1+xt*0|2+2*5+q*0|1+1+eh*0|1+1*6|3+3|1+1"}}},"pad:observatory.guide.jeanhuensitvextended:revs:8501":{"changeset":"Z:exj>1|1j=789=f2*d+1$e","meta":{"author":"a.T2VW9Z1FoOo412v8","timestamp":1518188236221}},"pad:observatory.guide.jeanhuensitvextended:revs:8502":{"changeset":"Z:exk<15|1j=789=f3-15$","meta":{"author":"a.T2VW9Z1FoOo412v8","timestamp":1518188243698}},"pad:observatory.guide.jeanhuensitvextended:revs:8503":{"changeset":"Z:ewf<4|1m=7ph=1u-5*d+1$O","meta":{"author":"a.T2VW9Z1FoOo412v8","timestamp":1518188264465}},"pad:observatory.guide.jeanhuensitvextended:revs:8504":{"changeset":"Z:ewb>1|1m=7ph=2a*d+1$P","meta":{"author":"a.T2VW9Z1FoOo412v8","timestamp":1518188269695}},"pad:observatory.guide.jeanhuensitvextended:revs:8505":{"changeset":"Z:ewc>1|1m=7ph=2b*d+1$r","meta":{"author":"a.T2VW9Z1FoOo412v8","timestamp":1518188270460}},"pad:observatory.guide.jeanhuensitvextended:revs:8506":{"changeset":"Z:ewd>2|1m=7ph=2c*d+2$of","meta":{"author":"a.T2VW9Z1FoOo412v8","timestamp":1518188270960}},"pad:observatory.guide.jeanhuensitvextended:revs:8507":{"changeset":"Z:ewf>1|1m=7ph=2e*d+1$.","meta":{"author":"a.T2VW9Z1FoOo412v8","timestamp":1518188271724}},"pad:observatory.guide.jeanhuensitvextended:revs:8508":{"changeset":"Z:ewg>1|1m=7ph=3z*d+1$o","meta":{"author":"a.T2VW9Z1FoOo412v8","timestamp":1518188281536}},"pad:observatory.guide.jeanhuensitvextended:revs:8509":{"changeset":"Z:ewh>1|1m=7ph=40*d+1$f","meta":{"author":"a.T2VW9Z1FoOo412v8","timestamp":1518188282034}},"pad:observatory.guide.jeanhuensitvextended:revs:851":{"changeset":"Z:5kf>4|18=505=5u*0*2+4$eren","meta":{"author":"a.kqv62Q3nhchdwIuK","timestamp":1518089944970}},"pad:observatory.guide.jeanhuensitvextended:revs:8510":{"changeset":"Z:ewi>1|1m=7ph=41*d+1$.","meta":{"author":"a.T2VW9Z1FoOo412v8","timestamp":1518188282545}},"pad:observatory.guide.jeanhuensitvextended:revs:8511":{"changeset":"Z:ewj>1|1m=7ph=43*d+1$

Huens interview extended\n**You have been using computers since a long time, as you explained us during the tour we had the joy of assisting during the TGSO.**\n**I heard that that until recently, let's say the late 1990's, when learning computer programming you had to start by  writing down the program on paper... ** \n\nIn 1973, i did study computer sciences, it was the second year of the Computer Sciense course, here in Leuven. At the time computers were mainframes and you did fed them with programms by punch cards. Programing was writing down the program, then you punched it and the next day you get results, mostly error. That's the way it worked at that time. To teach us programing, they used the langage of that time, Fortran and some kind of invented assembly langage, it didn't really exist, it was simplified.\n\nMost of the time you did write down your program, the teacher and the assistant would have to tell you what is wrong or good, you didn't had much practical experience.\n\n**How was it like, tons of pages ?** \n\nNo. As an anecdocte, i remember punchcards were a block of papers, we were jealous of the people who came in the computer center with huge stacks of cards. That were really small programs, not complicated one. In fact you had to learn to use the computer from scratch, everything was new, you couldn't rely on previous experiences, everything was new. And to start with small programs was difficult enough. \n\nThat was also the time when Edsger W. Dijkstra, who faught against the goto and other then common but bad constructs [@[text:1972:goto]. I still remember him, in an audience, giving us a lecture on good  techniques  in programming at the  International computing symposium 1977 in Liège (programming:  from craft to scientific discipline https://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/EWD/transcriptions/EWD05xx/EWD566.html). It was a rather hard course because Dijkstra expected you to quickly  understand and implement his ideas.\n\nAnd then from 75 on, computers became cheaper and could be bought by departments and smaller entities. And than came the first interactive computer. Still beasts about two cubic meters, costing two millions belgian francs. But it was low enough to allow people to type in directly commands. I started working here in 75 as a researcher, it has evolved continuously and i saw computers getting cheaper and getting easier to use.The way to use it was simplified, you could start to go to the beast and try it out.\n\nI remember more or less: you did write down the program in Fortran for instance… We always thought in the beginning that it would work and it didn't, so after a turn around you were giving it back to the operator and you have to wait another half a day or a night to get the results.\n\n**What kind of program you were working on?** \n\nI remember the first program i had to write was: you got three numbers, you had to make the program decide if you could construct a triangle with the numbers being the sides of the triangle.\n\n**That took an afternoon to be processed ?** \n\nWell, yeah. You had to imagine how to do it which was also one problem, than you prepare the cards with the punching machine and you give the package of cards to the operator who was feeeding the computer with the cards. Operator people had the taks to feed the computers by hands, with paper, cards, then cards got written on disks and later processed by the mainframe from disk. Finally results got printed on paper. it lasts onto the magnetic disks period. And after a number of hours or a night you got a listing, a piece of paper, with the results or program compilation errors.\n\n**When where you able to record the program onto the machine?**\n\nI think that did happen between 75 and 80. After the punching cards, which was already a way to record the program, we had  typewriters and then terminals. We could record the programs by typing it on the terminal  and the computer would store them on disk. We had magnetic discs. IBM had number for everything, i remember the 3300  [manufactured from 1970 on] was a magnetic disk. \nWe didn't touch the machines, operators would change the disks, we could only access the typewriter/terminal. That was our most direct connexion to the computer. The times were diffent. The mainframes were such huge costly beasts that it had operators day and night to keep it busy. Even at night there were two or three guys mounting tapes, dismounting tapes, that kind of stuff.\nhttps://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/42/IBM_magnetic_disk_drives_3330%2B3333.png/600px-IBM_magnetic_disk_drives_3330%2B3333.png\n\n**When did you stop working with operators?** \n\nSomewhere between 85 and 90. There were still operators at the main computer of the university, but there were also small computers, so researchers and student could have direct access when needed. \n\n**When did you start to work with software sold by others or gived away in order to do your research?** \n\nYou stil need an operating system on the mainframe that was delivered by IBM or the constructor delivering the mainframe. When you bought mini-computers, which were the  smaller versions of mainframes, in most cases you did buy an operating systems, compilers and all the stuff you did need to be able to program or work  those things. \nIn most cases,  the computer sciences department did buy the mini-computer from, for instance *Digital Equipment Corporation*,  a manufactorer at that time, but they didn't buy DEC's  software. The DEC software  was not open source or free,  and as a university we could get Unix for free and could run it on those digital equipment  DEC computers. That is what the computer department of the University of Louvain la Neuve *l'unité d'informatique*, did and so did we.\n\n**When did you start working with unix as an os?** \n\nI took a trip to Amsterdam, it must have been in 1979/80… Well, the story starts in our french sister university (LLN) where they did have a PDP-11 with Unix on it. You could get got Unix, at the time, when you were a university, from Bell Labs ( part of AT&T ), the american telephone company. ATT was a mega organisation at the time [before the [dismantlment of AT&T/Bell system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breakup_of_the_Bell_System)]. Due to monopoly, the US authorities did split it up in different Baby Bells. One of the restriction was that the  research baby bell,  could not sell anything. There were computer scientists there, who did developped some interesting things (e.g. Unix).  For universities you did get the source for free, but NO  support, nothing not even how to install it. In Unité d'informatique, where they had a PDP-11/70 https://i0.wp.com/www.utterpower.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/pdp11-70-panel.jpg  they were lucky: they got the same computer that unix was developped on.  They got the disk by snail mail as a post-office package. They mounted it and it did spin up and they had UNIX.\nHere, we did have a cheaper PDP11, the PDP 11/60  (https://dave.cheney.net/tag/pdp-11). We got the Unix disk distribution from Bell Labs but we could not run it, because we got another type of disk(RK07). We could look at it but that was all, because our disc format was different than the one at Bell Labs. Somebody here (P.Verbaeten) did write a driver for that disk in l'unité \nd'informatique of LLN. But they did not have a RK07.  it did compile it but we couldn't try it because we did not have. The nearest place  with Unix and RK07 was in Vrije Universiteit  Amsterdam.  Andrew Tenebaum, who did write a number of books on operating systems, was working there. He was learning to speak dutch. We did understood his english better but his assistant explained that he needed to practice speaking Dutch because he would have to pass an exam. There we compiled Unix with an RK07 driver and stored it on a bootable RK07 disk. With that disk back in Leuven we could start  Unix on our PDP11/60. An error in the process meant a trip Leuven-Amsterdam and back.\nIn my opinion the start of open source was Unix because everybody  had to maintain it by ourselves and we learned a lot from the sources. \nIn that time for software distribution you did have to store it on magnetic tape and send the tape us to different places with associated problems. For example,  the agents at the customs at the airport or post didn't know what to do with the tapes or discs in terms of custom clearance. They used magnetic or xrays as inspection tools and  we had to write on the package that it should not be x-rayed. and sometimes we still got unreadable tapes/discs. \n\n**So it took like weeks between the transportation, the custom...**\nYes, the custom had to clear the packages. I remember i've been in the customs in Zaventem. I had received a letter that my package from Bell Labs had arrived. I went there thinking i would have to pay something and go. But no. It had to be cleared so there wa some organisation that had to do administrative stuff, so i only got it a few days later. The response time was huge :)\n\n**Than after that period of time how did you switch from that kind of collaboration on how to make software and make software work to collaboration on networks, between universities and researchers...**\nIn the Unix systems at that time there was a kind of networking protocol which did work on serial lines (UUCP).\n To connect two unix systems together you only need a serial line . We had a line between LLN and Leuven, it's only 25 kms, but we had to ask Belgacom, then La Régie des Télégraphes et Téléphones, to get a modem to connect through their network and than over that modem you could reach an amazing speed of 300 characters per second. And that was the first communication. It did happened somewhere around 85. And then you had connexion with another computer, writing something here and do the transfer to the other computer and execute it there. \n \n **What was the first thing you did send through a network like this?**\n I didn't do it myself, i remember it was a kind of chat program. On LLN side was Prof.Elie Milgrom, he is retired now. On this side, it was Prof.  Yves Willems. And i remember that they typed something and they got a response from the other side and that was it.  But i remember that Pr Willems sent \"ok we stop now\". And that Elie Milgrom answered \"See you later, Alligator\" [a reference to Bill Haley and the Comets].  At the time we still had these kind of songs in mind. (lol). \nThose Unix to Unix connexions were first. And there was a worldwide Unix to Unix based network, Usenet (1979), it still exists somewhere... you can download load  of illegal movies and that stuff, that was not what we meant at the time. But that is what is left. And Usenet became gradually replaced by the Internet in USA. \nIn Europe, the Internet came a lot later, but we had limited access to the Internet by FTP; We could send mail to the Internet and we could receive mail from them, because Some friendly american university, later companies, did translate internet mail to UCP mail., moreover they did translate specially formatted mails iThat was before the 1990's.\n \n **Your relation to software had changed at the time because you did not have to do all this manipulations with the software your received... Was it already floppy discs ?**\n No, magnetic tapes, for the mainframe at least. Most of the mini-computers had some cheaper magnetic tapes. Between 90 and 95 the main machines for the software institute was a VAX from DEC. Once a year the software came from Berkeley, it was still Unix but modified by Berkeley for virtual memory and all the stuff which are common now. We received a tape, with lot of goodies, i still remember we didn't know what was on there but we scrutinised there to know what was there, what we can use.\nIn Europe, companies like Siemens were trying to set up software centers to make software avaiable, they were even trying to set up networks. Researchers did love the Internet, it worked, it was useful for their researchs. So companies in Europe, were trying to set up their own networks, i remember for example the X/OPEN transport protocol. Their was a lot of standards about what software layers should do, but it didn't succeed because sometime, 92 maybe, IBM decided to quit their own private network and to go forTCP/IP and was the switching point. Everything done for X/OPEN were suddently forgotten. For the mainframes, and certainly in Belgium computing was mainly mainframes, i'm talking about universities here, so when IBM decided to go for TCP/IP we followed even though things were really slow. For example, Belgacom was not interested in running the Domain Name System so we did it here, for some time, starting in 1993 with Pierre Verbaten (https://www.dnsbelgium.be/en/history). Belgacom were focused on X25 (DCS - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X.25) so they missed it.\n\nIt was like the french Minitel ? \nWell, at that time we were really jealous about Minitel. Could you imagine that? Terminals?  At home ? You could work home with a computer ! You could send emails ! All in one, a pc computer with a modem ! \n\nHow did the research about software evolved in the department?\nI am mainly talking about network research but here there were people working on numerical analysis, computing, artificial intelligence ... I was just not involved in those research so i don't know much about it \n\nYou were focused on software and network..\nYes, we did produce some software. We did make software to generate compilers, there was some A.I. software in Prolog, numerical analysis  libraries... Some were sold or shared, it depends.  \nWe did sell some software since the beginning i think when it was not even a department but a professor and a couple of students.\n\nIs it when you joined ? \nNo it was already a department. I did study dutch industrial engeneering in electronics. At the time in electronics you did hear something about computers, i was interested in it i wanted to know more. I heard they had started a year before a degree in computer engeneering. It was the first year where industrial engineer could join. The only thing we knew about computer were in movies. I wanted to know how it work. I'm not sure i still know now even if maybe i have some ideas...\n\nHow many langage do you know ?\nAssembly, FORTRAN, PL-1 the langage invented by IBM to be the universal one, C, Cobol. Perl, i don't know, so more. I'm not fluent in any other langages, but i can read any langage especially well writtened, i know i can understand it and learn it...I know JAVA also. As a system administrator the thing i use most are the command line of UNIX and Perl. But that's because i'm more familiar with those two so it goes faster.\n\nHow did you see the rise of personnal computer and the software that goes with ? \nI have to admit that we missed it. We didn't see that what was new was powerful. We were not impressed by the software. I remember windows 95, the news on TV, people sleeping on the street to get it. I remember when i get my first windows version, with a box of 22 floppies or so. Then i wanted to do something, to compile a program, but there was no compiler. We were used to Unix, a basic system but with a lot of utilities in it. Software was for us free, and we were used to have it free and it was not free anymore. \n\nDoes that mean you didn't had a personnal computer until late ? \nYes. I think it was round 2000. I didn't needed it really. I got one when the belgian UCP network became commercial. Of course i did not get Windows on it.  I think we got Linux here in 1994. There was a guy involved in the kernel studying here. So we did used it very fast.\n\nSo, what is software for you ?\nFor me software is the magic that make computer usable. I can only gives examples of what i mean by it. A PC without software most people, even computer scientists, can't do anything with it. You need basic software. Some software are already integrated in the computer hardware. Same for phones, tablets... The main characteristic, for me, is that it should be user friendly. That is very difficult i know, because you have to imagine what the people using your software are going to do with it and how they want to use it, that's the magic you need to solve.\n\nIs command line user friendly ? \nWell, somehow you have to learn the command langage that is in fact a computer langage where you can make all the constructs that other langages offers.\nYou can create loops, you can test, whatever. It's not so different from computer langages like C or JAVA or whatever. \n\nBut it's already software no ? User friendly depends on what you put behind these words, no ? \nYes it's already software. I don't have a strong opinion about command lines. It depends on people. I can imagine that someone that have never heard about the command line expect that you click somewhere and it happens. But if you know the command langage it's sometimes perhaps easier or productive to type commands and let it run. Sometimes, i find it easier if i have a screen and a number of buttons and i don't have to imagine what happens behind that screen. And sometimes i want to do something with the command line, because i'm used to it. That's why i don't trust myself about user friendliness because i have a long experience in computer interfaces. I'm so used to some of them perhaps i can't even imagine that somebody else would like to do it otherwise or doesn't like what i'm used to.\n\nApart from maintaining the museum, what do you work on ? You are still active in the department even though you are retired ? \nI work on sensors, in the internet of things world in one of the university spin-off. What i do for them is sensors wireless need power, and some of them are on batteries. They have designed a complete system which should makes the battery lasts for two, three, four years. They need a system to measure that. So i been working on a mechanism to measure that without waiting four years. That's programming instrumentation computers to mesure power or whatever, that's part Unix systems. There are enough new or unknown things and maybe because i'm older, i have another way of looking at things, so we have a lot of discussions. They don't like my Pearl, they use python, JAVA those things...Pearl, it has it's disavantage, but you could do a lot of thing, each character has a meaning. With Python, you need all those libraries...It's easy when you know the libraries you have to call. When you know the arguments of the librairies...so it's also complicated. ANd if the library change for some reasons, there you go. In my humble opinion it's the same with all the langages. It's starts easy from scratch but if you have to interface them with existing thing from the internet world or whatever it gets complicated.\n\nDo you have a last word ? \nI was surprised by your group reaction to the visit. I thought all of this were known. Maybe i'm getting old :) Curently i don't do much about the museum department, but sometimes i like to talk about the little stories about it. I remember a lot of little stories, a lot of technics who have been used and forgotten and some kept alive. I thought when i was young that the best techniques would succeed. That you would have visionnary people who would see the way. But i realized that a lot of thing happens by accident.\n\n\n\n\n","attribs":"*6|1+1*0*a*b*c+1*0+t*6|1+1*5+3p*6|1+1*5+4f*6|2+2+1y*d+n+47*d+1+76*6|2+2+4n*6|1+1|1+1*5+11*6|2+2+1s*e+1+41*d+2+3a*e+k+1l*6|2+2+38*0+j+48*2+3f+2y*6|2+2+9i*d+1+14*d+1+3j*6|2+2+6i*d+8+15*6|2+2*5+1a*6|2+2+1b*d+1+1u*d+6+1y*6|2+2*5+19*6|2+2+2p*d+1+3f*d+a+o*d+1+1b*d+1+2*d+l+9*d+2a+1*e+14+19*d+1+1b*d+u+1*6|2+2*5+1r*6|2+2+d*d+4+1e*d+1+1v*d+a+9*d+1+1*d+1+r*d+u+1*d+n+e*d*e+4*e+8+1t*d+1+2*d+1+s*d+4+h*d|1+1+2r*d+9+1l*0+1+2s*d+3+33*6|1+1+41*6|2+2*5+1a*6|2+2+4h*d+4+x*6|2+2*5+2w*6|2+2+7u*d+4+q*d+9+f*d|1+1+f*d+1+27*d+1+7*d+1+9*d+1+t*d+2+w*d+6+e*d+e+2*d+2+r*d+m+g*d+9+q*e+i*d+1+3q*6|2+2*5+1f*6|2+2+43*0+1+f*0+2+4*d+a*e+3+1h*d+p+z*d+3+3z*d+1+10*d+4+5*d+3+1n*d+6+r*d+4+f*d+1+1o*d+1+j*d+c+17*d+h+8*d+11+p*0+33+1k*d+2+3f*d+4+1*6|1+1+x*0+f+1*0+12+1*0*2+1*0+37+2q*0+4+2*0|1+21*0+1f+1v*0+1+1*0*2+1*0+fh*d|1+1*d+1+1j*d+a+1z*0+1*d|1+1+d*d+t+7*d+2+4*d+5+1*d+2+1*d+l+1*d+c+n*d+p+14*d+1+1k*d+9+1r*d+p+1r*d+q+c*d+6+7*0|2+2*5+1v*0|1+1+3y*0+4+6i*0|2+2*5+5m*0|1+1+i*d+1+1*d+2+29*d+7+1*0|1+1+1*d+2+1f*d+7+4*d+1+9*d+6+z*d+1+11*d+1+1*2+e*d*2+1*2+e*d*2+1*2+b+83*d+1j+2*0|1+1+1*0|1+1+1*5+1y*0|1+1+1u*d+1+f*d+5+1k*d+3+1*d+6+96*d|1+1+90*d|1+1+1h*d+8+m*d+a+m*d+b+10*e+9+1*d+1+2j*d+1l+r*0|1+1+1*0|1+1*5+4t*0|1+1+dr*0|1+1+u6*0|2+2*5+x*0|1+1+5q*0|2+2*5+1q*0|1+1+5w*0|2+2*5+16*0|1+1+5b*0|1+1+3l*0|2+2*5+o*0|1+1+df*0|2+2*5+u*0|1+1+bs*0|2+2*5+29*0|1+1+eh*0|2+2*5+1s*0|1+1+7m*0|2+2*5+u*0|1+1+fk*0|2+2*5+w*0|1+1+48*0|1+1+3b*0|2+2*5+2m*0|1+1+m9*0|2+2*5+3i*0|1+1+xt*0|2+2*5+q*0|1+1+eh*0|1+1*6|3+3|1+1"}}},"pad:observatory.guide.jeanhuensitvextended:revs:8601":{"changeset":"Z:eyy>1|1o=8by=8x*d+1$n","meta":{"author":"a.T2VW9Z1FoOo412v8","timestamp":1518188619051}},"pad:observatory.guide.jeanhuensitvextended:revs:8602":{"changeset":"Z:eyz>1|1o=8by=8y*d+1$t","meta":{"author":"a.T2VW9Z1FoOo412v8","timestamp":1518188619549}},"pad:observatory.guide.jeanhuensitvextended:revs:8603":{"changeset":"Z:ez0>1|1o=8by=8z*d+1$o","meta":{"author":"a.T2VW9Z1FoOo412v8","timestamp":1518188620062}},"pad:observatory.guide.jeanhuensitvextended:revs:8604":{"changeset":"Z:ez1>1|1o=8by=90*d+1$

tour we had the joy of assisting during the TGSO.**\n**I heard that that until recently, let's say the late 1990's, when learning computer programming you had to start by  writing down the program on paper... ** \n\nIn 1973, i did study computer sciences, it was the second year of the Computer Sciense course, here in Leuven. At the time computers were mainframes and you did fed them with programms by punch cards. Programing was writing down the program, then you punched it and the next day you get results, mostly error. That's the way it worked at that time. To teach us programing, they used the langage of that time, Fortran and some kind of invented assembly langage, it didn't really exist, it was simplified.\n\nMost of the time you did write down your program, the teacher and the assistant would have to tell you what is wrong or good, you didn't had much practical experience.\n\n**How was it like, tons of pages ?** \n\nNo. As an anecdocte, i remember punchcards were a block of papers, we were jealous of the people who came in the computer center with huge stacks of cards. That were really small programs, not complicated one. In fact you had to learn to use the computer from scratch, everything was new, you couldn't rely on previous experiences, everything was new. And to start with small programs was difficult enough. \n\nThat was also the time when Edsger W. Dijkstra, who faught against the goto and other then common but bad constructs [@[text:1972:goto]. I still remember him, in an audience, giving us a lecture on good  techniques  in programming at the  International computing symposium 1977 in Liège (programming:  from craft to scientific discipline https://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/EWD/transcriptions/EWD05xx/EWD566.html). It was a rather hard course because Dijkstra expected you to quickly  understand and implement his ideas.\n\nAnd then from 75 on, computers became cheaper and could be bought by departments and smaller entities. And than came the first interactive computer. Still beasts about two cubic meters, costing two millions belgian francs. But it was low enough to allow people to type in directly commands. I started working here in 75 as a researcher, it has evolved continuously and i saw computers getting cheaper and getting easier to use.The way to use it was simplified, you could start to go to the beast and try it out.\n\nI remember more or less: you did write down the program in Fortran for instance… We always thought in the beginning that it would work and it didn't, so after a turn around you were giving it back to the operator and you have to wait another half a day or a night to get the results.\n\n**What kind of program you were working on?** \n\nI remember the first program i had to write was: you got three numbers, you had to make the program decide if you could construct a triangle with the numbers being the sides of the triangle.\n\n**That took an afternoon to be processed ?** \n\nWell, yeah. You had to imagine how to do it which was also one problem, than you prepare the cards with the punching machine and you give the package of cards to the operator who was feeeding the computer with the cards. Operator people had the taks to feed the computers by hands, with paper, cards, then cards got written on disks and later processed by the mainframe from disk. Finally results got printed on paper. it lasts onto the magnetic disks period. And after a number of hours or a night you got a listing, a piece of paper, with the results or program compilation errors.\n\n**When where you able to record the program onto the machine?**\n\nI think that did happen between 75 and 80. After the punching cards, which was already a way to record the program, we had  typewriters and then terminals. We could record the programs by typing it on the terminal  and the computer would store them on disk. We had magnetic discs. IBM had number for everything, i remember the 3300  [manufactured from 1970 on] was a magnetic disk. \nWe didn't touch the machines, operators would change the disks, we could only access the typewriter/terminal. That was our most direct connexion to the computer. The times were diffent. The mainframes were such huge costly beasts that it had operators day and night to keep it busy. Even at night there were two or three guys mounting tapes, dismounting tapes, that kind of stuff.\nhttps://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/42/IBM_magnetic_disk_drives_3330%2B3333.png/600px-IBM_magnetic_disk_drives_3330%2B3333.png\n\n**When did you stop working with operators?** \n\nSomewhere between 85 and 90. There were still operators at the main computer of the university, but there were also small computers, so researchers and student could have direct access when needed. \n\n**When did you start to work with software sold by others or gived away in order to do your research?** \n\nYou stil need an operating system on the mainframe that was delivered by IBM or the constructor delivering the mainframe. When you bought mini-computers, which were the  smaller versions of mainframes, in most cases you did buy an operating systems, compilers and all the stuff you did need to be able to program or work  those things. \nIn most cases,  the computer sciences department did buy the mini-computer from, for instance *Digital Equipment Corporation*,  a manufactorer at that time, but they didn't buy DEC's  software. The DEC software  was not open source or free,  and as a university we could get Unix for free and could run it on those digital equipment  DEC computers. That is what the computer department of the University of Louvain la Neuve *l'unité d'informatique*, did and so did we.\n\n**When did you start working with unix as an os?** \n\nI took a trip to Amsterdam, it must have been in 1979/80… Well, the story starts in our french sister university (LLN) where they did have a PDP-11 with Unix on it. You could get got Unix, at the time, when you were a university, from Bell Labs ( part of AT&T ), the american telephone company. ATT was a mega organisation at the time [before the [dismantlment of AT&T/Bell system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breakup_of_the_Bell_System)]. Due to monopoly, the US authorities did split it up in different Baby Bells. One of the restriction was that the  research baby bell,  could not sell anything. There were computer scientists there, who did developped some interesting things (e.g. Unix).  For universities you did get the source for free, but NO  support, nothing not even how to install it. In Unité d'informatique, where they had a PDP-11/70 https://i0.wp.com/www.utterpower.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/pdp11-70-panel.jpg  they were lucky: they got the same computer that unix was developped on.  They got the disk by snail mail as a post-office package. They mounted it and it did spin up and they had UNIX.\nHere, we did have a cheaper PDP11, the PDP 11/60  (https://dave.cheney.net/tag/pdp-11). We got the Unix disk distribution from Bell Labs but we could not run it, because we got another type of disk(RK07). We could look at it but that was all, because our disc format was different than the one at Bell Labs. Somebody here (P.Verbaeten) did write a driver for that disk in l'unité \nd'informatique of LLN. But they did not have a RK07.  it did compile it but we couldn't try it because we did not have. The nearest place  with Unix and RK07 was in Vrije Universiteit  Amsterdam.  Andrew Tenebaum, who did write a number of books on operating systems, was working there. He was learning to speak dutch. We did understood his english better but his assistant explained that he needed to practice speaking Dutch because he would have to pass an exam. There we compiled Unix with an RK07 driver and stored it on a bootable RK07 disk. With that disk back in Leuven we could start  Unix on our PDP11/60. An error in the process meant a trip Leuven-Amsterdam and back.\nIn my opinion the start of open source was Unix because everybody  had to maintain it by ourselves and we learned a lot from the sources. \nIn that time for software distribution you did have to store it on magnetic tape and send the tape us to different places with associated problems. For example,  the agents at the customs at the airport or post didn't know what to do with the tapes or discs in terms of custom clearance. They used magnetic or xrays as inspection tools and  we had to write on the package that it should not be x-rayed. and sometimes we still got unreadable tapes/discs. \n\n**So it took like weeks between the transportation, the custom...**\nYes, the custom had to clear the packages. I remember i've been in the customs in Zaventem. I had received a letter that my package from Bell Labs had arrived. I went there thinking i would have to pay something and go. But no. It had to be cleared so there wa some organisation that had to do administrative stuff, so i only got it a few days later. The response time was huge :)\n\n**Than after that period of time how did you switch from that kind of collaboration on how to make software and make software work to collaboration on networks, between universities and researchers...**\nIn the Unix systems at that time there was a kind of networking protocol which did work on serial lines (UUCP).\n To connect two unix systems together you only need a serial line . We had a line between LLN and Leuven, it's only 25 kms, but we had to ask Belgacom, then La Régie des Télégraphes et Téléphones, to get a modem to connect through their network and than over that modem you could reach an amazing speed of 300 characters per second. And that was the first communication. It did happened somewhere around 85. And then you had connexion with another computer, writing something here and do the transfer to the other computer and execute it there. \n \n **What was the first thing you did send through a network like this?**\n I didn't do it myself, i remember it was a kind of chat program. On LLN side was Prof.Elie Milgrom, he is retired now. On this side, it was Prof.  Yves Willems. And i remember that they typed something and they got a response from the other side and that was it.  But i remember that Pr Willems sent \"ok we stop now\". And that Elie Milgrom answered \"See you later, Alligator\" [a reference to Bill Haley and the Comets].  At the time we still had these kind of songs in mind. (lol). \nThose Unix to Unix connexions were first. And there was a worldwide Unix to Unix based network, Usenet (1979), it still exists somewhere... you can download load  of illegal movies and that stuff, that was not what we meant at the time. But that is what is left. And Usenet became gradually replaced by the Internet in USA. \nIn Europe, the Internet came a lot later, but we had limited access to the Internet by mail and even FTP; We could send mail to the Internet and we could receive mail from them, because Some friendly american university, later companies, did translate internet mail to UCP mail., moreover they did translate specially formatted mails into FTP request and send the result back to us by mail. That was before the 1990's.\n \n **Your relation to software had changed at the time because you did not have to do all this manipulations with the software your received... Was it already floppy discs ?**\n No, magnetic tapes, for the mainframe at least. Even most of the mini-computers had some (cheaper) magnetic tapes. Between 90 and 95 the main machines used for  Unix software development was a VAX from DEC. Once a year the software came from Berkeley, it was still Unix but modified by Berkeley for virtual memory and all the stuff which are common now. We received a tape, with lot of goodies, i still remember we didn't know what was on the tape  but we did scrutinise it  to know what was on there, what we can use.\nIn Europe, companies like Siemens were trying to set up software centers to make software avaiable, they were even trying to set up networks. Researchers did love the Internet, it worked, it was useful for their researchs. So companies in Europe, were trying to set up their own networks, i remember for example the X/OPEN transport protocol. Their was a lot of standards about what software layers should do, but it didn't succeed because sometime, 92 maybe, IBM decided to quit their own private network and to go forTCP/IP and was the switching point. Everything done for X/OPEN were suddently forgotten. For the mainframes, and certainly in Belgium computing was mainly mainframes, i'm talking about universities here, so when IBM decided to go for TCP/IP we followed even though things were really slow. For example, Belgacom was not interested in running the Domain Name System so we did it here, for some time, starting in 1993 with Pierre Verbaten (https://www.dnsbelgium.be/en/history). Belgacom were focused on X25 (DCS - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X.25) so they missed it.\n\nIt was like the french Minitel ? \nWell, at that time we were really jealous about Minitel. Could you imagine that? Terminals?  At home ? You could work home with a computer ! You could send emails ! All in one, a pc computer with a modem ! \n\nHow did the research about software evolved in the department?\nI am mainly talking about network research but here there were people working on numerical analysis, computing, artificial intelligence ... I was just not involved in those research so i don't know much about it \n\nYou were focused on software and network..\nYes, we did produce some software. We did make software to generate compilers, there was some A.I. software in Prolog, numerical analysis  libraries... Some were sold or shared, it depends.  \nWe did sell some software since the beginning i think when it was not even a department but a professor and a couple of students.\n\nIs it when you joined ? \nNo it was already a department. I did study dutch industrial engeneering in electronics. At the time in electronics you did hear something about computers, i was interested in it i wanted to know more. I heard they had started a year before a degree in computer engeneering. It was the first year where industrial engineer could join. The only thing we knew about computer were in movies. I wanted to know how it work. I'm not sure i still know now even if maybe i have some ideas...\n\nHow many langage do you know ?\nAssembly, FORTRAN, PL-1 the langage invented by IBM to be the universal one, C, Cobol. Perl, i don't know, so more. I'm not fluent in any other langages, but i can read any langage especially well writtened, i know i can understand it and learn it...I know JAVA also. As a system administrator the thing i use most are the command line of UNIX and Perl. But that's because i'm more familiar with those two so it goes faster.\n\nHow did you see the rise of personnal computer and the software that goes with ? \nI have to admit that we missed it. We didn't see that what was new was powerful. We were not impressed by the software. I remember windows 95, the news on TV, people sleeping on the street to get it. I remember when i get my first windows version, with a box of 22 floppies or so. Then i wanted to do something, to compile a program, but there was no compiler. We were used to Unix, a basic system but with a lot of utilities in it. Software was for us free, and we were used to have it free and it was not free anymore. \n\nDoes that mean you didn't had a personnal computer until late ? \nYes. I think it was round 2000. I didn't needed it really. I got one when the belgian UCP network became commercial. Of course i did not get Windows on it.  I think we got Linux here in 1994. There was a guy involved in the kernel studying here. So we did used it very fast.\n\nSo, what is software for you ?\nFor me software is the magic that make computer usable. I can only gives examples of what i mean by it. A PC without software most people, even computer scientists, can't do anything with it. You need basic software. Some software are already integrated in the computer hardware. Same for phones, tablets... The main characteristic, for me, is that it should be user friendly. That is very difficult i know, because you have to imagine what the people using your software are going to do with it and how they want to use it, that's the magic you need to solve.\n\nIs command line user friendly ? \nWell, somehow you have to learn the command langage that is in fact a computer langage where you can make all the constructs that other langages offers.\nYou can create loops, you can test, whatever. It's not so different from computer langages like C or JAVA or whatever. \n\nBut it's already software no ? User friendly depends on what you put behind these words, no ? \nYes it's already software. I don't have a strong opinion about command lines. It depends on people. I can imagine that someone that have never heard about the command line expect that you click somewhere and it happens. But if you know the command langage it's sometimes perhaps easier or productive to type commands and let it run. Sometimes, i find it easier if i have a screen and a number of buttons and i don't have to imagine what happens behind that screen. And sometimes i want to do something with the command line, because i'm used to it. That's why i don't trust myself about user friendliness because i have a long experience in computer interfaces. I'm so used to some of them perhaps i can't even imagine that somebody else would like to do it otherwise or doesn't like what i'm used to.\n\nApart from maintaining the museum, what do you work on ? You are still active in the department even though you are retired ? \nI work on sensors, in the internet of things world in one of the university spin-off. What i do for them is sensors wireless need power, and some of them are on batteries. They have designed a complete system which should makes the battery lasts for two, three, four years. They need a system to measure that. So i been working on a mechanism to measure that without waiting four years. That's programming instrumentation computers to mesure power or whatever, that's part Unix systems. There are enough new or unknown things and maybe because i'm older, i have another way of looking at things, so we have a lot of discussions. They don't like my Pearl, they use python, JAVA those things...Pearl, it has it's disavantage, but you could do a lot of thing, each character has a meaning. With Python, you need all those libraries...It's easy when you know the libraries you have to call. When you know the arguments of the librairies...so it's also complicated. ANd if the library change for some reasons, there you go. In my humble opinion it's the same with all the langages. It's starts easy from scratch but if you have to interface them with existing thing from the internet world or whatever it gets complicated.\n\nDo you have a last word ? \nI was surprised by your group reaction to the visit. I thought all of this were known. Maybe i'm getting old :) Curently i don't do much about the museum department, but sometimes i like to talk about the little stories about it. I remember a lot of little stories, a lot of technics who have been used and forgotten and some kept alive. I thought when i was young that the best techniques would succeed. That you would have visionnary people who would see the way. But i realized that a lot of thing happens by accident.\n\n\n\n\n","attribs":"*6|1+1*0*a*b*c+1*0+t*6|1+1*5+3p*6|1+1*5+4f*6|2+2+1y*d+n+47*d+1+76*6|2+2+4n*6|1+1|1+1*5+11*6|2+2+1s*e+1+41*d+2+3a*e+k+1l*6|2+2+38*0+j+48*2+3f+2y*6|2+2+9i*d+1+14*d+1+3j*6|2+2+6i*d+8+15*6|2+2*5+1a*6|2+2+1b*d+1+1u*d+6+1y*6|2+2*5+19*6|2+2+2p*d+1+3f*d+a+o*d+1+1b*d+1+2*d+l+9*d+2a+1*e+14+19*d+1+1b*d+u+1*6|2+2*5+1r*6|2+2+d*d+4+1e*d+1+1v*d+a+9*d+1+1*d+1+r*d+u+1*d+n+e*d*e+4*e+8+1t*d+1+2*d+1+s*d+4+h*d|1+1+2r*d+9+1l*0+1+2s*d+3+33*6|1+1+41*6|2+2*5+1a*6|2+2+4h*d+4+x*6|2+2*5+2w*6|2+2+7u*d+4+q*d+9+f*d|1+1+f*d+1+27*d+1+7*d+1+9*d+1+t*d+2+w*d+6+e*d+e+2*d+2+r*d+m+g*d+9+q*e+i*d+1+3q*6|2+2*5+1f*6|2+2+43*0+1+f*0+2+4*d+a*e+3+1h*d+p+z*d+3+3z*d+1+10*d+4+5*d+3+1n*d+6+r*d+4+f*d+1+1o*d+1+j*d+c+17*d+h+8*d+11+p*0+33+1k*d+2+3f*d+4+1*6|1+1+x*0+f+1*0+12+1*0*2+1*0+37+2q*0+4+2*0|1+21*0+1f+1v*0+1+1*0*2+1*0+fh*d|1+1*d+1+1j*d+a+1z*0+1*d|1+1+d*d+t+7*d+2+4*d+5+1*d+2+1*d+l+1*d+c+n*d+p+14*d+1+1k*d+9+1r*d+p+1r*d+q+c*d+6+7*0|2+2*5+1v*0|1+1+3y*0+4+6i*0|2+2*5+5m*0|1+1+i*d+1+1*d+2+29*d+7+1*0|1+1+1*d+2+1f*d+7+4*d+1+9*d+6+z*d+1+11*d+1+1*2+e*d*2+1*2+e*d*2+1*2+b+83*d+1j+2*0|1+1+1*0|1+1+1*5+1y*0|1+1+1u*d+1+f*d+5+1k*d+3+1*d+6+96*d|1+1+90*d|1+1+1h*d+8+m*d+o+m*d+b+10*e+9+1*d+1+2j*d+35+r*0|1+1+1*0|1+1*5+4t*0|1+1+1d*d+6+z*d+1+6*d+2+1h*d+5+5*d+5+9*d+c+73*d+6+8*d+4+b*d+3+i*d+3+n*0|1+1+u6*0|2+2*5+x*0|1+1+5q*0|2+2*5+1q*0|1+1+5w*0|2+2*5+16*0|1+1+5b*0|1+1+3l*0|2+2*5+o*0|1+1+df*0|2+2*5+u*0|1+1+bs*0|2+2*5+29*0|1+1+eh*0|2+2*5+1s*0|1+1+7m*0|2+2*5+u*0|1+1+fk*0|2+2*5+w*0|1+1+48*0|1+1+3b*0|2+2*5+2m*0|1+1+m9*0|2+2*5+3i*0|1+1+xt*0|2+2*5+q*0|1+1+eh*0|1+1*6|3+3|1+1"}}},"pad:observatory.guide.jeanhuensitvextended:revs:8701":{"changeset":"Z:f1k>1|1r=8sh=ef*d+1$.","meta":{"author":"a.T2VW9Z1FoOo412v8","timestamp":1518188944899}},"pad:observatory.guide.jeanhuensitvextended:revs:8702":{"changeset":"Z:f1l>2|1r=8sh=eg*d+2$..","meta":{"author":"a.T2VW9Z1FoOo412v8","timestamp":1518188945399}},"pad:observatory.guide.jeanhuensitvextended:revs:8703":{"changeset":"Z:f1n>1|1s=970=3o*d+1$E","meta":{"author":"a.T2VW9Z1FoOo412v8","timestamp":1518188975110}},"pad:observatory.guide.jeanhuensitvextended:revs:8704":{"changeset":"Z:f1o>1|1s=970=3p*d+1$u","meta":{"author":"a.T2VW9Z1FoOo412v8","timestamp":1518188975607}},"pad:observatory.guide.jeanhuensitvextended:revs:8705":{"changeset":"Z:f1p>1|1s=970=3q*d+1$r","meta":{"author":"a.T2VW9Z1FoOo412v8","timestamp":1518188976119}},"pad:observatory.guide.jeanhuensitvextended:revs:8706":{"changeset":"Z:f1q>1|1s=970=3r*d+1$o","meta":{"author":"a.T2VW9Z1FoOo412v8","timestamp":1518188976613}},"pad:observatory.guide.jeanhuensitvextended:revs:8707":{"changeset":"Z:f1r>1|1s=970=3s*d+1$p","meta":{"author":"a.T2VW9Z1FoOo412v8","timestamp":1518188977116}},"pad:observatory.guide.jeanhuensitvextended:revs:8708":{"changeset":"Z:f1s>1|1s=970=3t*d+1$e","meta":{"author":"a.T2VW9Z1FoOo412v8","timestamp":1518188977617}},"pad:observatory.guide.jeanhuensitvextended:revs:8709":{"changeset":"Z:f1t>2|1s=970=3u*d+2$an","meta":{"author":"a.T2VW9Z1FoOo412v8","timestamp":1518188978122}},"pad:observatory.guide.jeanhuensitvextended:revs:871":{"changeset":"Z:5lq>3|18=505=8h*0*2+3$led","meta":{"author":"a.kqv62Q3nhchdwIuK","timestamp":1518089973340}},"pad:observatory.guide.jeanhuensitvextended:revs:8710":{"changeset":"Z:f1v>1|1s=970=3w*d+1$

tour we had the joy of assisting during the TGSO.**\n**I heard that that until recently, let's say the late 1990's, when learning computer programming you had to start by  writing down the program on paper... ** \n\nIn 1973, i did study computer sciences, it was the second year of the Computer Sciense course, here in Leuven. At the time computers were mainframes and you did fed them with programms by punch cards. Programing was writing down the program, then you punched it and the next day you get results, mostly error. That's the way it worked at that time. To teach us programing, they used the langage of that time, Fortran and some kind of invented assembly langage, it didn't really exist, it was simplified.\n\nMost of the time you did write down your program, the teacher and the assistant would have to tell you what is wrong or good, you didn't had much practical experience.\n\n**How was it like, tons of pages ?** \n\nNo. As an anecdocte, i remember punchcards were a block of papers, we were jealous of the people who came in the computer center with huge stacks of cards. That were really small programs, not complicated one. In fact you had to learn to use the computer from scratch, everything was new, you couldn't rely on previous experiences, everything was new. And to start with small programs was difficult enough. \n\nThat was also the time when Edsger W. Dijkstra, who faught against the goto and other then common but bad constructs [@[text:1972:goto]. I still remember him, in an audience, giving us a lecture on good  techniques  in programming at the  International computing symposium 1977 in Liège (programming:  from craft to scientific discipline https://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/EWD/transcriptions/EWD05xx/EWD566.html). It was a rather hard course because Dijkstra expected you to quickly  understand and implement his ideas.\n\nAnd then from 75 on, computers became cheaper and could be bought by departments and smaller entities. And than came the first interactive computer. Still beasts about two cubic meters, costing two millions belgian francs. But it was low enough to allow people to type in directly commands. I started working here in 75 as a researcher, it has evolved continuously and i saw computers getting cheaper and getting easier to use.The way to use it was simplified, you could start to go to the beast and try it out.\n\nI remember more or less: you did write down the program in Fortran for instance… We always thought in the beginning that it would work and it didn't, so after a turn around you were giving it back to the operator and you have to wait another half a day or a night to get the results.\n\n**What kind of program you were working on?** \n\nI remember the first program i had to write was: you got three numbers, you had to make the program decide if you could construct a triangle with the numbers being the sides of the triangle.\n\n**That took an afternoon to be processed ?** \n\nWell, yeah. You had to imagine how to do it which was also one problem, than you prepare the cards with the punching machine and you give the package of cards to the operator who was feeeding the computer with the cards. Operator people had the taks to feed the computers by hands, with paper, cards, then cards got written on disks and later processed by the mainframe from disk. Finally results got printed on paper. it lasts onto the magnetic disks period. And after a number of hours or a night you got a listing, a piece of paper, with the results or program compilation errors.\n\n**When where you able to record the program onto the machine?**\n\nI think that did happen between 75 and 80. After the punching cards, which was already a way to record the program, we had  typewriters and then terminals. We could record the programs by typing it on the terminal  and the computer would store them on disk. We had magnetic discs. IBM had number for everything, i remember the 3300  [manufactured from 1970 on] was a magnetic disk. \nWe didn't touch the machines, operators would change the disks, we could only access the typewriter/terminal. That was our most direct connexion to the computer. The times were diffent. The mainframes were such huge costly beasts that it had operators day and night to keep it busy. Even at night there were two or three guys mounting tapes, dismounting tapes, that kind of stuff.\nhttps://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/42/IBM_magnetic_disk_drives_3330%2B3333.png/600px-IBM_magnetic_disk_drives_3330%2B3333.png\n\n**When did you stop working with operators?** \n\nSomewhere between 85 and 90. There were still operators at the main computer of the university, but there were also small computers, so researchers and student could have direct access when needed. \n\n**When did you start to work with software sold by others or gived away in order to do your research?** \n\nYou stil need an operating system on the mainframe that was delivered by IBM or the constructor delivering the mainframe. When you bought mini-computers, which were the  smaller versions of mainframes, in most cases you did buy an operating systems, compilers and all the stuff you did need to be able to program or work  those things. \nIn most cases,  the computer sciences department did buy the mini-computer from, for instance *Digital Equipment Corporation*,  a manufactorer at that time, but they didn't buy DEC's  software. The DEC software  was not open source or free,  and as a university we could get Unix for free and could run it on those digital equipment  DEC computers. That is what the computer department of the University of Louvain la Neuve *l'unité d'informatique*, did and so did we.\n\n**When did you start working with unix as an os?** \n\nI took a trip to Amsterdam, it must have been in 1979/80… Well, the story starts in our french sister university (LLN) where they did have a PDP-11 with Unix on it. You could get got Unix, at the time, when you were a university, from Bell Labs ( part of AT&T ), the american telephone company. ATT was a mega organisation at the time [before the [dismantlment of AT&T/Bell system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breakup_of_the_Bell_System)]. Due to monopoly, the US authorities did split it up in different Baby Bells. One of the restriction was that the  research baby bell,  could not sell anything. There were computer scientists there, who did developped some interesting things (e.g. Unix).  For universities you did get the source for free, but NO  support, nothing not even how to install it. In Unité d'informatique, where they had a PDP-11/70 https://i0.wp.com/www.utterpower.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/pdp11-70-panel.jpg  they were lucky: they got the same computer that unix was developped on.  They got the disk by snail mail as a post-office package. They mounted it and it did spin up and they had UNIX.\nHere, we did have a cheaper PDP11, the PDP 11/60  (https://dave.cheney.net/tag/pdp-11). We got the Unix disk distribution from Bell Labs but we could not run it, because we got another type of disk(RK07). We could look at it but that was all, because our disc format was different than the one at Bell Labs. Somebody here (P.Verbaeten) did write a driver for that disk in l'unité \nd'informatique of LLN. But they did not have a RK07.  it did compile it but we couldn't try it because we did not have. The nearest place  with Unix and RK07 was in Vrije Universiteit  Amsterdam.  Andrew Tenebaum, who did write a number of books on operating systems, was working there. He was learning to speak dutch. We did understood his english better but his assistant explained that he needed to practice speaking Dutch because he would have to pass an exam. There we compiled Unix with an RK07 driver and stored it on a bootable RK07 disk. With that disk back in Leuven we could start  Unix on our PDP11/60. An error in the process meant a trip Leuven-Amsterdam and back.\nIn my opinion the start of open source was Unix because everybody  had to maintain it by ourselves and we learned a lot from the sources. \nIn that time for software distribution you did have to store it on magnetic tape and send the tape us to different places with associated problems. For example,  the agents at the customs at the airport or post didn't know what to do with the tapes or discs in terms of custom clearance. They used magnetic or xrays as inspection tools and  we had to write on the package that it should not be x-rayed. and sometimes we still got unreadable tapes/discs. \n\n**So it took like weeks between the transportation, the custom...**\nYes, the custom had to clear the packages. I remember i've been in the customs in Zaventem. I had received a letter that my package from Bell Labs had arrived. I went there thinking i would have to pay something and go. But no. It had to be cleared so there wa some organisation that had to do administrative stuff, so i only got it a few days later. The response time was huge :)\n\n**Than after that period of time how did you switch from that kind of collaboration on how to make software and make software work to collaboration on networks, between universities and researchers...**\nIn the Unix systems at that time there was a kind of networking protocol which did work on serial lines (UUCP).\n To connect two unix systems together you only need a serial line . We had a line between LLN and Leuven, it's only 25 kms, but we had to ask Belgacom, then La Régie des Télégraphes et Téléphones, to get a modem to connect through their network and than over that modem you could reach an amazing speed of 300 characters per second. And that was the first communication. It did happened somewhere around 85. And then you had connexion with another computer, writing something here and do the transfer to the other computer and execute it there. \n \n **What was the first thing you did send through a network like this?**\n I didn't do it myself, i remember it was a kind of chat program. On LLN side was Prof.Elie Milgrom, he is retired now. On this side, it was Prof.  Yves Willems. And i remember that they typed something and they got a response from the other side and that was it.  But i remember that Pr Willems sent \"ok we stop now\". And that Elie Milgrom answered \"See you later, Alligator\" [a reference to Bill Haley and the Comets].  At the time we still had these kind of songs in mind. (lol). \nThose Unix to Unix connexions were first. And there was a worldwide Unix to Unix based network, Usenet (1979), it still exists somewhere... you can download load  of illegal movies and that stuff, that was not what we meant at the time. But that is what is left. And Usenet became gradually replaced by the Internet in USA. \nIn Europe, the Internet came a lot later, but we had limited access to the Internet by mail and even FTP; We could send mail to the Internet and we could receive mail from them, because Some friendly american university, later companies, did translate internet mail to UCP mail., moreover they did translate specially formatted mails into FTP request and send the result back to us by mail. That was before the 1990's.\n \n **Your relation to software had changed at the time because you did not have to do all this manipulations with the software your received... Was it already floppy discs ?**\n No, magnetic tapes, for the mainframe at least. Even most of the mini-computers had some (cheaper) magnetic tapes. Between 90 and 95 the main machines used for  Unix software development was a VAX from DEC. Once a year the software came from Berkeley, it was still Unix but modified by Berkeley for virtual memory and all the stuff which are common now. We received a tape, with lot of goodies, i still remember we didn't know what was on the tape  but we did scrutinise it  to know what was on there, what we can use....\nIn Europe, companies like Siemens were trying to set up software centers to make software avaiable, they were even trying to set up European networks. But researchers did love the Internet, it worked, it was useful for their researchs. So companies in Europe, were trying to set up their own networks, i remember for example the X/OPEN transport protocol. Their was a lot of standards about what software layers should do, but it didn't succeed because around 1992  IBM decided to quit their own private network and to go forTCP/IP and was the switching point. \nEverything done for X/OPEN were suddently forgotten. For the mainframes, and certainly in Belgium computing was mainly mainframes, i'm talking about universities here, so when IBM decided to go for TCP/IP Univiversities did follow. \nBut the aceptation of TCP/IP was really  of TCP/IP was even though things were really slow. For example, Belgacom was not interested in running the Domain Name System so we did it here, for some time, starting in 1993 with Pierre Verbaten (https://www.dnsbelgium.be/en/history). Belgacom were focused on X25 (DCS - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X.25) so they missed it.\n\nIt was like the french Minitel ? \nWell, at that time we were really jealous about Minitel. Could you imagine that? Terminals?  At home ? You could work home with a computer ! You could send emails ! All in one, a pc computer with a modem ! \n\nHow did the research about software evolved in the department?\nI am mainly talking about network research but here there were people working on numerical analysis, computing, artificial intelligence ... I was just not involved in those research so i don't know much about it \n\nYou were focused on software and network..\nYes, we did produce some software. We did make software to generate compilers, there was some A.I. software in Prolog, numerical analysis  libraries... Some were sold or shared, it depends.  \nWe did sell some software since the beginning i think when it was not even a department but a professor and a couple of students.\n\nIs it when you joined ? \nNo it was already a department. I did study dutch industrial engeneering in electronics. At the time in electronics you did hear something about computers, i was interested in it i wanted to know more. I heard they had started a year before a degree in computer engeneering. It was the first year where industrial engineer could join. The only thing we knew about computer were in movies. I wanted to know how it work. I'm not sure i still know now even if maybe i have some ideas...\n\nHow many langage do you know ?\nAssembly, FORTRAN, PL-1 the langage invented by IBM to be the universal one, C, Cobol. Perl, i don't know, so more. I'm not fluent in any other langages, but i can read any langage especially well writtened, i know i can understand it and learn it...I know JAVA also. As a system administrator the thing i use most are the command line of UNIX and Perl. But that's because i'm more familiar with those two so it goes faster.\n\nHow did you see the rise of personnal computer and the software that goes with ? \nI have to admit that we missed it. We didn't see that what was new was powerful. We were not impressed by the software. I remember windows 95, the news on TV, people sleeping on the street to get it. I remember when i get my first windows version, with a box of 22 floppies or so. Then i wanted to do something, to compile a program, but there was no compiler. We were used to Unix, a basic system but with a lot of utilities in it. Software was for us free, and we were used to have it free and it was not free anymore. \n\nDoes that mean you didn't had a personnal computer until late ? \nYes. I think it was round 2000. I didn't needed it really. I got one when the belgian UCP network became commercial. Of course i did not get Windows on it.  I think we got Linux here in 1994. There was a guy involved in the kernel studying here. So we did used it very fast.\n\nSo, what is software for you ?\nFor me software is the magic that make computer usable. I can only gives examples of what i mean by it. A PC without software most people, even computer scientists, can't do anything with it. You need basic software. Some software are already integrated in the computer hardware. Same for phones, tablets... The main characteristic, for me, is that it should be user friendly. That is very difficult i know, because you have to imagine what the people using your software are going to do with it and how they want to use it, that's the magic you need to solve.\n\nIs command line user friendly ? \nWell, somehow you have to learn the command langage that is in fact a computer langage where you can make all the constructs that other langages offers.\nYou can create loops, you can test, whatever. It's not so different from computer langages like C or JAVA or whatever. \n\nBut it's already software no ? User friendly depends on what you put behind these words, no ? \nYes it's already software. I don't have a strong opinion about command lines. It depends on people. I can imagine that someone that have never heard about the command line expect that you click somewhere and it happens. But if you know the command langage it's sometimes perhaps easier or productive to type commands and let it run. Sometimes, i find it easier if i have a screen and a number of buttons and i don't have to imagine what happens behind that screen. And sometimes i want to do something with the command line, because i'm used to it. That's why i don't trust myself about user friendliness because i have a long experience in computer interfaces. I'm so used to some of them perhaps i can't even imagine that somebody else would like to do it otherwise or doesn't like what i'm used to.\n\nApart from maintaining the museum, what do you work on ? You are still active in the department even though you are retired ? \nI work on sensors, in the internet of things world in one of the university spin-off. What i do for them is sensors wireless need power, and some of them are on batteries. They have designed a complete system which should makes the battery lasts for two, three, four years. They need a system to measure that. So i been working on a mechanism to measure that without waiting four years. That's programming instrumentation computers to mesure power or whatever, that's part Unix systems. There are enough new or unknown things and maybe because i'm older, i have another way of looking at things, so we have a lot of discussions. They don't like my Pearl, they use python, JAVA those things...Pearl, it has it's disavantage, but you could do a lot of thing, each character has a meaning. With Python, you need all those libraries...It's easy when you know the libraries you have to call. When you know the arguments of the librairies...so it's also complicated. ANd if the library change for some reasons, there you go. In my humble opinion it's the same with all the langages. It's starts easy from scratch but if you have to interface them with existing thing from the internet world or whatever it gets complicated.\n\nDo you have a last word ? \nI was surprised by your group reaction to the visit. I thought all of this were known. Maybe i'm getting old :) Curently i don't do much about the museum department, but sometimes i like to talk about the little stories about it. I remember a lot of little stories, a lot of technics who have been used and forgotten and some kept alive. I thought when i was young that the best techniques would succeed. That you would have visionnary people who would see the way. But i realized that a lot of thing happens by accident.\n\n\n\n\n","attribs":"*6|1+1*0*a*b*c+1*0+t*6|1+1*5+3p*6|1+1*5+4f*6|2+2+1y*d+n+47*d+1+76*6|2+2+4n*6|1+1|1+1*5+11*6|2+2+1s*e+1+41*d+2+3a*e+k+1l*6|2+2+38*0+j+48*2+3f+2y*6|2+2+9i*d+1+14*d+1+3j*6|2+2+6i*d+8+15*6|2+2*5+1a*6|2+2+1b*d+1+1u*d+6+1y*6|2+2*5+19*6|2+2+2p*d+1+3f*d+a+o*d+1+1b*d+1+2*d+l+9*d+2a+1*e+14+19*d+1+1b*d+u+1*6|2+2*5+1r*6|2+2+d*d+4+1e*d+1+1v*d+a+9*d+1+1*d+1+r*d+u+1*d+n+e*d*e+4*e+8+1t*d+1+2*d+1+s*d+4+h*d|1+1+2r*d+9+1l*0+1+2s*d+3+33*6|1+1+41*6|2+2*5+1a*6|2+2+4h*d+4+x*6|2+2*5+2w*6|2+2+7u*d+4+q*d+9+f*d|1+1+f*d+1+27*d+1+7*d+1+9*d+1+t*d+2+w*d+6+e*d+e+2*d+2+r*d+m+g*d+9+q*e+i*d+1+3q*6|2+2*5+1f*6|2+2+43*0+1+f*0+2+4*d+a*e+3+1h*d+p+z*d+3+3z*d+1+10*d+4+5*d+3+1n*d+6+r*d+4+f*d+1+1o*d+1+j*d+c+17*d+h+8*d+11+p*0+33+1k*d+2+3f*d+4+1*6|1+1+x*0+f+1*0+12+1*0*2+1*0+37+2q*0+4+2*0|1+21*0+1f+1v*0+1+1*0*2+1*0+fh*d|1+1*d+1+1j*d+a+1z*0+1*d|1+1+d*d+t+7*d+2+4*d+5+1*d+2+1*d+l+1*d+c+n*d+p+14*d+1+1k*d+9+1r*d+p+1r*d+q+c*d+6+7*0|2+2*5+1v*0|1+1+3y*0+4+6i*0|2+2*5+5m*0|1+1+i*d+1+1*d+2+29*d+7+1*0|1+1+1*d+2+1f*d+7+4*d+1+9*d+6+z*d+1+11*d+1+1*2+e*d*2+1*2+e*d*2+1*2+b+83*d+1j+2*0|1+1+1*0|1+1+1*5+1y*0|1+1+1u*d+1+f*d+5+1k*d+3+1*d+6+96*d|1+1+90*d|1+1+1h*d+8+m*d+o+m*d+b+10*e+9+1*d+1+2j*d+35+r*0|1+1+1*0|1+1*5+4t*0|1+1+1d*d+6+z*d+1+6*d+2+1h*d+5+5*d+5+9*d+c+73*d+6+8*d+4+b*d+3+i*d+3+n*d+3*0|1+1+3o*d+9+a*d+5+89*d+b+2p*d|1+1+5p*d+i+7*d+1+1*d|1+1*d+1j+8q*0|2+2*5+x*0|1+1+5q*0|2+2*5+1q*0|1+1+5w*0|2+2*5+16*0|1+1+5b*0|1+1+3l*0|2+2*5+o*0|1+1+df*0|2+2*5+u*0|1+1+bs*0|2+2*5+29*0|1+1+eh*0|2+2*5+1s*0|1+1+7m*0|2+2*5+u*0|1+1+fk*0|2+2*5+w*0|1+1+48*0|1+1+3b*0|2+2*5+2m*0|1+1+m9*0|2+2*5+3i*0|1+1+xt*0|2+2*5+q*0|1+1+eh*0|1+1*6|3+3|1+1"}}},"pad:observatory.guide.jeanhuensitvextended:revs:8801":{"changeset":"Z:f3t>2|1u=9t3=14*d+2$sl","meta":{"author":"a.T2VW9Z1FoOo412v8","timestamp":1518189323521}},"pad:observatory.guide.jeanhuensitvextended:revs:8802":{"changeset":"Z:f3v>1|1u=9t3=16*d+1$o","meta":{"author":"a.T2VW9Z1FoOo412v8","timestamp":1518189324027}},"pad:observatory.guide.jeanhuensitvextended:revs:8803":{"changeset":"Z:f3w>1|1u=9t3=17*d+1$w","meta":{"author":"a.T2VW9Z1FoOo412v8","timestamp":1518189324521}},"pad:observatory.guide.jeanhuensitvextended:revs:8804":{"changeset":"Z:f3x>1|1u=9t3=18*d+1$.","meta":{"author":"a.T2VW9Z1FoOo412v8","timestamp":1518189326715}},"pad:observatory.guide.jeanhuensitvextended:revs:8805":{"changeset":"Z:f3y<1f|1u=9t3=1a-1f$","meta":{"author":"a.T2VW9Z1FoOo412v8","timestamp":1518189338205}},"pad:observatory.guide.jeanhuensitvextended:revs:8806":{"changeset":"Z:f2j>0|20=aal=1f-1*d+1$.","meta":{"author":"a.T2VW9Z1FoOo412v8","timestamp":1518189408183}},"pad:observatory.guide.jeanhuensitvextended:revs:8807":{"changeset":"Z:f2j>1|20=aal=1g*d+1$

tour we had the joy of assisting during the TGSO.**\n**I heard that that until recently, let's say the late 1990's, when learning computer programming you had to start by  writing down the program on paper... ** \n\nIn 1973, i did study computer sciences, it was the second year of the Computer Sciense course, here in Leuven. At the time computers were mainframes and you did fed them with programms by punch cards. Programing was writing down the program, then you punched it and the next day you get results, mostly error. That's the way it worked at that time. To teach us programing, they used the langage of that time, Fortran and some kind of invented assembly langage, it didn't really exist, it was simplified.\n\nMost of the time you did write down your program, the teacher and the assistant would have to tell you what is wrong or good, you didn't had much practical experience.\n\n**How was it like, tons of pages ?** \n\nNo. As an anecdocte, i remember punchcards were a block of papers, we were jealous of the people who came in the computer center with huge stacks of cards. That were really small programs, not complicated one. In fact you had to learn to use the computer from scratch, everything was new, you couldn't rely on previous experiences, everything was new. And to start with small programs was difficult enough. \n\nThat was also the time when Edsger W. Dijkstra, who faught against the goto and other then common but bad constructs [@[text:1972:goto]. I still remember him, in an audience, giving us a lecture on good  techniques  in programming at the  International computing symposium 1977 in Liège (programming:  from craft to scientific discipline https://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/EWD/transcriptions/EWD05xx/EWD566.html). It was a rather hard course because Dijkstra expected you to quickly  understand and implement his ideas.\n\nAnd then from 75 on, computers became cheaper and could be bought by departments and smaller entities. And than came the first interactive computer. Still beasts about two cubic meters, costing two millions belgian francs. But it was low enough to allow people to type in directly commands. I started working here in 75 as a researcher, it has evolved continuously and i saw computers getting cheaper and getting easier to use.The way to use it was simplified, you could start to go to the beast and try it out.\n\nI remember more or less: you did write down the program in Fortran for instance… We always thought in the beginning that it would work and it didn't, so after a turn around you were giving it back to the operator and you have to wait another half a day or a night to get the results.\n\n**What kind of program you were working on?** \n\nI remember the first program i had to write was: you got three numbers, you had to make the program decide if you could construct a triangle with the numbers being the sides of the triangle.\n\n**That took an afternoon to be processed ?** \n\nWell, yeah. You had to imagine how to do it which was also one problem, than you prepare the cards with the punching machine and you give the package of cards to the operator who was feeeding the computer with the cards. Operator people had the taks to feed the computers by hands, with paper, cards, then cards got written on disks and later processed by the mainframe from disk. Finally results got printed on paper. it lasts onto the magnetic disks period. And after a number of hours or a night you got a listing, a piece of paper, with the results or program compilation errors.\n\n**When where you able to record the program onto the machine?**\n\nI think that did happen between 75 and 80. After the punching cards, which was already a way to record the program, we had  typewriters and then terminals. We could record the programs by typing it on the terminal  and the computer would store them on disk. We had magnetic discs. IBM had number for everything, i remember the 3300  [manufactured from 1970 on] was a magnetic disk. \nWe didn't touch the machines, operators would change the disks, we could only access the typewriter/terminal. That was our most direct connexion to the computer. The times were diffent. The mainframes were such huge costly beasts that it had operators day and night to keep it busy. Even at night there were two or three guys mounting tapes, dismounting tapes, that kind of stuff.\nhttps://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/42/IBM_magnetic_disk_drives_3330%2B3333.png/600px-IBM_magnetic_disk_drives_3330%2B3333.png\n\n**When did you stop working with operators?** \n\nSomewhere between 85 and 90. There were still operators at the main computer of the university, but there were also small computers, so researchers and student could have direct access when needed. \n\n**When did you start to work with software sold by others or gived away in order to do your research?** \n\nYou stil need an operating system on the mainframe that was delivered by IBM or the constructor delivering the mainframe. When you bought mini-computers, which were the  smaller versions of mainframes, in most cases you did buy an operating systems, compilers and all the stuff you did need to be able to program or work  those things. \nIn most cases,  the computer sciences department did buy the mini-computer from, for instance *Digital Equipment Corporation*,  a manufactorer at that time, but they didn't buy DEC's  software. The DEC software  was not open source or free,  and as a university we could get Unix for free and could run it on those digital equipment  DEC computers. That is what the computer department of the University of Louvain la Neuve *l'unité d'informatique*, did and so did we.\n\n**When did you start working with unix as an os?** \n\nI took a trip to Amsterdam, it must have been in 1979/80… Well, the story starts in our french sister university (LLN) where they did have a PDP-11 with Unix on it. You could get got Unix, at the time, when you were a university, from Bell Labs ( part of AT&T ), the american telephone company. ATT was a mega organisation at the time [before the [dismantlment of AT&T/Bell system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breakup_of_the_Bell_System)]. Due to monopoly, the US authorities did split it up in different Baby Bells. One of the restriction was that the  research baby bell,  could not sell anything. There were computer scientists there, who did developped some interesting things (e.g. Unix).  For universities you did get the source for free, but NO  support, nothing not even how to install it. In Unité d'informatique, where they had a PDP-11/70 https://i0.wp.com/www.utterpower.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/pdp11-70-panel.jpg  they were lucky: they got the same computer that unix was developped on.  They got the disk by snail mail as a post-office package. They mounted it and it did spin up and they had UNIX.\nHere, we did have a cheaper PDP11, the PDP 11/60  (https://dave.cheney.net/tag/pdp-11). We got the Unix disk distribution from Bell Labs but we could not run it, because we got another type of disk(RK07). We could look at it but that was all, because our disc format was different than the one at Bell Labs. Somebody here (P.Verbaeten) did write a driver for that disk in l'unité \nd'informatique of LLN. But they did not have a RK07.  it did compile it but we couldn't try it because we did not have. The nearest place  with Unix and RK07 was in Vrije Universiteit  Amsterdam.  Andrew Tenebaum, who did write a number of books on operating systems, was working there. He was learning to speak dutch. We did understood his english better but his assistant explained that he needed to practice speaking Dutch because he would have to pass an exam. There we compiled Unix with an RK07 driver and stored it on a bootable RK07 disk. With that disk back in Leuven we could start  Unix on our PDP11/60. An error in the process meant a trip Leuven-Amsterdam and back.\nIn my opinion the start of open source was Unix because everybody  had to maintain it by ourselves and we learned a lot from the sources. \nIn that time for software distribution you did have to store it on magnetic tape and send the tape us to different places with associated problems. For example,  the agents at the customs at the airport or post didn't know what to do with the tapes or discs in terms of custom clearance. They used magnetic or xrays as inspection tools and  we had to write on the package that it should not be x-rayed. and sometimes we still got unreadable tapes/discs. \n\n**So it took like weeks between the transportation, the custom...**\nYes, the custom had to clear the packages. I remember i've been in the customs in Zaventem. I had received a letter that my package from Bell Labs had arrived. I went there thinking i would have to pay something and go. But no. It had to be cleared so there wa some organisation that had to do administrative stuff, so i only got it a few days later. The response time was huge :)\n\n**Than after that period of time how did you switch from that kind of collaboration on how to make software and make software work to collaboration on networks, between universities and researchers...**\nIn the Unix systems at that time there was a kind of networking protocol which did work on serial lines (UUCP).\n To connect two unix systems together you only need a serial line . We had a line between LLN and Leuven, it's only 25 kms, but we had to ask Belgacom, then La Régie des Télégraphes et Téléphones, to get a modem to connect through their network and than over that modem you could reach an amazing speed of 300 characters per second. And that was the first communication. It did happened somewhere around 85. And then you had connexion with another computer, writing something here and do the transfer to the other computer and execute it there. \n \n **What was the first thing you did send through a network like this?**\n I didn't do it myself, i remember it was a kind of chat program. On LLN side was Prof.Elie Milgrom, he is retired now. On this side, it was Prof.  Yves Willems. And i remember that they typed something and they got a response from the other side and that was it.  But i remember that Pr Willems sent \"ok we stop now\". And that Elie Milgrom answered \"See you later, Alligator\" [a reference to Bill Haley and the Comets].  At the time we still had these kind of songs in mind. (lol). \nThose Unix to Unix connexions were first. And there was a worldwide Unix to Unix based network, Usenet (1979), it still exists somewhere... you can download load  of illegal movies and that stuff, that was not what we meant at the time. But that is what is left. And Usenet became gradually replaced by the Internet in USA. \nIn Europe, the Internet came a lot later, but we had limited access to the Internet by mail and even FTP; We could send mail to the Internet and we could receive mail from them, because Some friendly american university, later companies, did translate internet mail to UCP mail., moreover they did translate specially formatted mails into FTP request and send the result back to us by mail. That was before the 1990's.\n \n **Your relation to software had changed at the time because you did not have to do all this manipulations with the software your received... Was it already floppy discs ?**\n No, magnetic tapes, for the mainframe at least. Even most of the mini-computers had some (cheaper) magnetic tapes. Between 90 and 95 the main machines used for  Unix software development was a VAX from DEC. Once a year the software came from Berkeley, it was still Unix but modified by Berkeley for virtual memory and all the stuff which are common now. We received a tape, with lot of goodies, i still remember we didn't know what was on the tape  but we did scrutinise it  to know what was on there, what we can use....\nIn Europe, companies like Siemens were trying to set up software centers to make software avaiable, they were even trying to set up European networks. But researchers did love the Internet, it worked, it was useful for their researchs. So companies in Europe, were trying to set up their own networks, i remember for example the X/OPEN transport protocol. Their was a lot of standards about what software layers should do, but it didn't succeed because around 1992  IBM decided to quit their own private network and to go forTCP/IP and was the switching point. \nEverything done for X/OPEN were suddently forgotten. For the mainframes, and certainly in Belgium computing was mainly mainframes, i'm talking about universities here, so when IBM decided to go for TCP/IP Univiversities did follow. \nBut the aceptation of TCP/IP was really slow. For example, Belgacom was not interested in running the Domain Name System so we did it here, for some time, starting in 1993 with Pierre Verbaten (https://www.dnsbelgium.be/en/history). Belgacom were focused on X25 (DCS - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X.25) so they missed it.\n\nIt was like the french Minitel ? \nWell, at that time we were really jealous about Minitel. Could you imagine that? Terminals?  At home ? You could work home with a computer ! You could send emails ! All in one, a pc computer with a modem ! \n\nHow did the research about software evolved in the department?\nI am mainly talking about network research but here. Tthere were people working on numerical analysis, computing, artificial intelligence ... I was just not involved in those research so i don't know much about it \n\nYou were focused on software and network..\nYes, we did produce some software. We did make software to generate compilers, there was some A.I. software in Prolog, numerical analysis  libraries... Some were sold or shared, it depends.  \nWe did sell some software since the beginning i think when it was not even a department but a professor and a couple of students.\n\nIs it when you joined ? \nNo it was already a department. I did study first industrial engeneering in electronics. At the time in electronics you did hear something about computers, i was interested in it i wanted to know more. I heard Kuleuvenhad started a year before a degree in computer engeneering. It was the first year where industrial engineers could join. The only thing we knew about computer were from movies. I wanted to know how it work. I'm not sure if I know now it now, but I have some ideas...\n\nHow many langage do you know ?\nAssembly, FORTRAN, PL-1 the langage invented by IBM to be the universal one, C, Cobol. Perl, i don't know, some  more. I'm not fluent in any computer langage, but i can read any langage especially well written, I knowIi can understand it and, if neede,  learn it...I know JAVA also. As a system administrator the thing I use most are the command line of UNIX and Perl. But that's because i'm more familiar with those two so it goes faster.\n\nHow did you see the rise of personnal computer and the software that goes with ? \nI have to admit that we missed it. We didn't see the new thing was powerful because  We were not impressed by the software. I remember windows 95, the news on TV, people sleeping on the street to get it. I remember when i get my first windows version, with a box of 22 floppies or so. Then i wanted to do something, to compile a program, but there was no compiler. We were used to Unix, a basic system but with a lot of utilities in it. Software was for us free, and we were used to have it free and it was not free anymore. \n\nDoes that mean you didn't had a personnal computer until late ? \nYes. I think it was round 2000. I didn't needed it really. I got one when the belgian UCP network became commercial. Of course i did not get Windows on it.  I think we got Linux here in 1994. There was a guy involved in the kernel studying here. So we did used it very fast.\n\nSo, what is software for you ?\nFor me software is the magic that make computer usable. I can only gives examples of what i mean by it. A PC without software most people, even computer scientists, can't do anything with it. You need basic software. Some software are already integrated in the computer hardware. Same for phones, tablets... The main characteristic, for me, is that it should be user friendly. That is very difficult i know, because you have to imagine what the people using your software are going to do with it and how they want to use it, that's the magic you need to solve.\n\nIs command line user friendly ? \nWell, somehow you have to learn the command langage that is in fact a computer langage where you can make all the constructs that other langages offers.\nYou can create loops, you can test, whatever. It's not so different from computer langages like C or JAVA or whatever. \n\nBut it's already software no ? User friendly depends on what you put behind these words, no ? \nYes it's already software. I don't have a strong opinion about command lines. It depends on people. I can imagine that someone that have never heard about the command line expect that you click somewhere and it happens. But if you know the command langage it's sometimes perhaps easier or productive to type commands and let it run. Sometimes, i find it easier if i have a screen and a number of buttons and i don't have to imagine what happens behind that screen. And sometimes i want to do something with the command line, because i'm used to it. That's why i don't trust myself about user friendliness because i have a long experience in computer interfaces. I'm so used to some of them perhaps i can't even imagine that somebody else would like to do it otherwise or doesn't like what i'm used to.\n\nApart from maintaining the museum, what do you work on ? You are still active in the department even though you are retired ? \nI work on sensors, in the internet of things world in one of the university spin-off. What i do for them is sensors wireless need power, and some of them are on batteries. They have designed a complete system which should makes the battery lasts for two, three, four years. They need a system to measure that. So i been working on a mechanism to measure that without waiting four years. That's programming instrumentation computers to mesure power or whatever, that's part Unix systems. There are enough new or unknown things and maybe because i'm older, i have another way of looking at things, so we have a lot of discussions. They don't like my Pearl, they use python, JAVA those things...Pearl, it has it's disavantage, but you could do a lot of thing, each character has a meaning. With Python, you need all those libraries...It's easy when you know the libraries you have to call. When you know the arguments of the librairies...so it's also complicated. ANd if the library change for some reasons, there you go. In my humble opinion it's the same with all the langages. It's starts easy from scratch but if you have to interface them with existing thing from the internet world or whatever it gets complicated.\n\nDo you have a last word ? \nI was surprised by your group reaction to the visit. I thought all of this were known. Maybe i'm getting old :) Curently i don't do much about the museum department, but sometimes i like to talk about the little stories about it. I remember a lot of little stories, a lot of technics who have been used and forgotten and some kept alive. I thought when i was young that the best techniques would succeed.

__NOPUBLISH__\n\n\n**You have been using computers since a long time, as you explained us during the tour we had the joy of assisting during the TGSO.**\n**I heard that that until recently, let's say the late 1990's, when learning computer programming you had to start by  writing down the program on paper... ** \n\nIn 1973, i did study computer sciences, it was the second year of the department, here in Leuven. At the time computers were mainframes and you did fed them with programms by punch cards. Programing was writing down the program, than you punched it and the next day you get results, mostly error. That's the way it worked at that time. To teach us programing, they used the langage of that time, Fortran and some kind of invented assembly langage, it didn't really exist, it was simplified.\n\nMost of the time you did write down your program, the teacher and the assistant would have to tell you what is wrong or good, you didn't had much practical experience.\n\n**How was it like, tons of pages ?** \n\nNo. As an anecdocte, i remember punchcards were a block of papers, we were jealous of the people who came in the computer center with huge stacks of cards. That were really small programs, not complicated one. The fact you had to learn to use the computer from scratch, everything was new, you couldn't rely on previous experiences, everything was new. And to start with small programs was difficult enough. \n\nThat was also the time when Edsger W. Dijkstra who forked the goto... i still remember him, in an audience, giving us a lecture on modernisation in programming at the International computing symposium 1977 in Liège (programming: from craft to scientific discipline https://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/EWD/transcriptions/EWD05xx/EWD566.html). He told usxx (i'll complete it as soon as possible. i need Jean's input)\"\n\nAnd then from 75 on, computers became cheaper and could be bought by departments and smaller entities. And than came the first interactive computer. Still beasts about two cubic meters, costing two millions belgian francs. But it was low enough to allow people to type in directly commands. I started working here in 75 as a researcher, it have evolved continuously and i saw computer getting cheaper and getting easier to use.The way to use it was simplified, you could start to go to the beast and try it out.\n\nI remember more or less: you did write down the program in Fortran for instance… We always thought in the beginning that it would work and it didn't, so after a turn around you were giving it back to the operator and you have to wait half a day or a night to get the results.\n\n**What kind of program you were working on?** \n\nI remember the first program i had to write was you got three numbers, you had to make the program decide if you construct a triangle with the numbers being the sides of the triangle.\n\n**That took an afternoon to be processed ?** \n\nWell, yeah. You had to imagine how to do it which was also one problem, than you prepare the card with the punching machine and you give the package of cards to the operator who was feeeding the computer with the cards. People had the taks to fed the computers by hands, with paper, cards, than disks and it lasts onto the magnetic disks period. And after a number of hours or a night you get a listing, a piece of paper, with the results.\n\n**When where you able to record the program onto the machine?**\n\nI think that happens between 75 and 80. After the punching cards which was already a way to record the program, we had  typewriters, terminals but we could record the programs, we could store them on the computer. We had magnetic discs. IBM had number for everything, i remember the 33-30 [manufactured from 1970 on] had a magnetic disk. We didn't touch the machines, operators would change the disks, we could only access the typewriter. That was our most direct connexion to the computer. Thetimes were diffent. The mainframes were such huge costly beasts that it had operators day and night keeping it busy. Even at night there were two or three guys mounting tapes, dismounting tapes, that kind of stuff.\nhttps://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/42/IBM_magnetic_disk_drives_3330%2B3333.png/600px-IBM_magnetic_disk_drives_3330%2B3333.png\n\n**When did you stop working with operators?** \n\nSomewhere between 85 and 90. There were still operators at the main computer of the university, but there were also small computers, so researchers and student can have direct access when needed. \n\n**When did you start to work with software sold by others or gived away in order to do your research?** \n\nYou stil need an operating system on the mainframe that was delivered by IBM or the constructor delivering the mainframe. When you bought mini-computers, which were the  smaller versions of mainframes, in most cases you did buy an operating systems, compilers and all the stuff you need to be able to program those things. In most cases, because the computer sciences department did buy the mini-computer from, for instance *digital equipment corporation*,  a manufactorer of that time, but they didn't buy their software. They were not open source or free,  but you could get Unix and could run it on those digital equipment (DEC) computers. That is what the computer department of the University of Louvain la Neuve *l'unité d'informatique*, did and so did we.\n\n**When did you start working with unix as an os?** \n\nI took a trip to Amsterdam, it must have been in 1979/80… Well, the story starts in our french sister university (LLN) where they did have a PDP-11 with Unix on it https://hackadaycom.files.wordpress.com/2016/08/full-size-pdp11.jpg. You got Unix, at the time, when you were a university, from Bell Aps (Ma Bell), the american telephone company. It was a mega organisation at the time [before the [dismantlment of AT&T/Bell system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breakup_of_the_Bell_System)].Due to monopoly, the US authorities splitted up in different Baby Bells. One of the restriction was there was a research baby bell, they couldn't really sell anything.There were computer scientists there, who did developped some Unix interesting things.  For universities you did get the source and no support for free. How to install it, no idea. In Unité d'informatique, they were lucky: they got the same computer that unix were developped on.  They got the disk by snail mail as a post-office package. They mounted it and it did spin up and they had it.\nHere, we did have a cheaper PDP11 (DEC - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PDP-11) We go the disk source from Bell Aps but we could not run it. We could look at it but that was all, because our disc format was different than the one at Bell Aps. Somebody here did write a driver for that disk and we did compiled it in l'unité d'informatique of LLN.  it did compile it but we couldn't try it because we did not have SThe nearest place was in Amsterdam.  Andrew Tenebaum who did write a number of books on operating systems was working there. It was the young Tanenbaum, just arriving from United States to Amsterdam. He was learning to speak dutch. We did understood his english better but his assistant insisted that he speaks dutch because he will have to pass an exam in dutch.\nWe got a disk with, that disk we got here and we start using Unix.\n\n\n\n\n\n","attribs":"|1+g*6|2+2*5+3p*6|1+1*5+4f*6|2+2+dm*6|2+2+4n*6|1+1|1+1*5+11*6|2+2+bc*6|2+2+5z*2+3e*3+1*4*3+20*4+1*6|2+2+e7*6|2+2+7n*6|2+2*5+1a*6|2+2+53*6|2+2*5+19*6|2+2+c7*6|2+2*5+1r*6|2+2+jo*6|1+1+41*6|2+2*5+1a*6|2+2+5g*6|2+2*5+2w*6|2+2+l6*6|2+2*5+1f*6|2+2+8f*5+7+50*0+z+2p*0+5+9*0+7+o*0+1+r*0+8+1c*0+3+19*0+9+k*0+1+9*0+1a+o*0+1+2d*0+1h*6|1+1*2+2l*0*2+l*2+p*0*2+2u*2+1b*0*2+n*2+10*0*2+1u*2+a3*6|1+1*2+1u*6|5+5|1+1"}}},"pad:observatory.guide.jeanhuensitvextended:revs:9000":{"changeset":"Z:f5c<1|2t=ds5=68-1$","meta":{"author":"a.T2VW9Z1FoOo412v8","timestamp":1518190417841,"atext":{"text":"\n*Jean Huens interview extended\n**You have been using computers since a long time, as you explained us during the tour we had the joy of assisting during the TGSO.**\n**I heard that that until recently, let's say the late 1990's, when learning computer programming you had to start by  writing down the program on paper... ** \n\nIn 1973, i did study computer sciences, it was the second year of the Computer Sciense course, here in Leuven.

In Unité d'informatique, where they had a PDP-11/70 https://i0.wp.com/www.utterpower.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/pdp11-70-panel.jpg  they were lucky: they got the same computer that unix was developped on.  They got the disk by snail mail as a post-office package. They mounted it and it did spin up and they had UNIX.\nHere, we did have a cheaper PDP11, the PDP 11/60  (https://dave.cheney.net/tag/pdp-11). We got the Unix disk distribution from Bell Labs but we could not run it, because we got another type of disk(RK07). We could look at it but that was all, because our disc format was different than the one at Bell Labs. Somebody here (P.Verbaeten) did write a driver for that disk in l'unité \nd'informatique of LLN. But they did not have a RK07.  it did compile it but we couldn't try it because we did not have. The nearest place  with Unix and RK07 was in Vrije Universiteit  Amsterdam.  Andrew Tenebaum, who did write a number of books on operating systems, was working there. He was learning to speak dutch. We did understood his english better but his assistant explained that he needed to practice speaking Dutch because he would have to pass an exam. There we compiled Unix with an RK07 driver and stored it on a bootable RK07 disk. With that disk back in Leuven we could start  Unix on our PDP11/60. An error in the process meant a trip Leuven-Amsterdam and back.\nIn my opinion the start of open source was Unix because everybody  had to maintain it by ourselves and we learned a lot from the sources. \nIn that time for software distribution you did have to store it on magnetic tape and send the tape us to different places with associated problems. For example,  the agents at the customs at the airport or post didn't know what to do with the tapes or discs in terms of custom clearance. They used magnetic or xrays as inspection tools and  we had to write on the package that it should not be x-rayed. and sometimes we still got unreadable tapes/discs. \n\n**So it took like weeks between the transportation, the custom...**\nYes, the custom had to clear the packages. I remember i've been in the customs in Zaventem. I had received a letter that my package from Bell Labs had arrived. I went there thinking i would have to pay something and go. But no. It had to be cleared so there wa some organisation that had to do administrative stuff, so i only got it a few days later. The response time was huge :)\n\n**Than after that period of time how did you switch from that kind of collaboration on how to make software and make software work to collaboration on networks, between universities and researchers...**\nIn the Unix systems at that time there was a kind of networking protocol which did work on serial lines (UUCP).\n To connect two unix systems together you only need a serial line . We had a line between LLN and Leuven, it's only 25 kms, but we had to ask Belgacom, then La Régie des Télégraphes et Téléphones, to get a modem to connect through their network and than over that modem you could reach an amazing speed of 300 characters per second. And that was the first communication. It did happened somewhere around 85. And then you had connexion with another computer, writing something here and do the transfer to the other computer and execute it there. \n \n **What was the first thing you did send through a network like this?**\n I didn't do it myself, i remember it was a kind of chat program. On LLN side was Prof.Elie Milgrom, he is retired now. On this side, it was Prof.  Yves Willems. And i remember that they typed something and they got a response from the other side and that was it.  But i remember that Pr Willems sent \"ok we stop now\". And that Elie Milgrom answered \"See you later, Alligator\" [a reference to Bill Haley and the Comets].  At the time we still had these kind of songs in mind. (lol). \nThose Unix to Unix connexions were first. And there was a worldwide Unix to Unix based network, Usenet (1979), it still exists somewhere... you can download load  of illegal movies and that stuff, that was not what we meant at the time. But that is what is left. And Usenet became gradually replaced by the Internet in USA. \nIn Europe, the Internet came a lot later, but we had limited access to the Internet by mail and even FTP; We could send mail to the Internet and we could receive mail from them, because Some friendly american university, later companies, did translate internet mail to UCP mail., moreover they did translate specially formatted mails into FTP request and send the result back to us by mail. That was before the 1990's.\n \n **Your relation to software had changed at the time because you did not have to do all this manipulations with the software your received... Was it already floppy discs ?**\n No, magnetic tapes, for the mainframe at least. Even most of the mini-computers had some (cheaper) magnetic tapes. Between 90 and 95 the main machines used for  Unix software development was a VAX from DEC. Once a year the software came from Berkeley, it was still Unix but modified by Berkeley for virtual memory and all the stuff which are common now. We received a tape, with lot of goodies, i still remember we didn't know what was on the tape  but we did scrutinise it  to know what was on there, what we can use....\nIn Europe, companies like Siemens were trying to set up software centers to make software avaiable, they were even trying to set up European networks. But researchers did love the Internet, it worked, it was useful for their researchs. So companies in Europe, were trying to set up their own networks, i remember for example the X/OPEN transport protocol. Their was a lot of standards about what software layers should do, but it didn't succeed because around 1992  IBM decided to quit their own private network and to go forTCP/IP and was the switching point. \nEverything done for X/OPEN were suddently forgotten. For the mainframes, and certainly in Belgium computing was mainly mainframes, i'm talking about universities here, so when IBM decided to go for TCP/IP Univiversities did follow. \nBut the aceptation of TCP/IP was really slow. For example, Belgacom was not interested in running the Domain Name System so we did it here, for some time, starting in 1993 with Pierre Verbaten (https://www.dnsbelgium.be/en/history). Belgacom were focused on X25 (DCS - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X.25) so they missed it.\n\nIt was like the french Minitel ? \nWell, at that time we were really jealous about Minitel. Could you imagine that? Terminals?  At home ? You could work home with a computer ! You could send emails ! All in one, a pc computer with a modem ! \n\nHow did the research about software evolved in the department?\nI am mainly talking about network research but here. Tthere were people working on numerical analysis, computing, artificial intelligence ... I was just not involved in those research so i don't know much about it \n\nYou were focused on software and network..\nYes, we did produce some software. We did make software to generate compilers, there was some A.I. software in Prolog, numerical analysis  libraries... Some were sold or shared, it depends.  \nWe did sell some software since the beginning i think when it was not even a department but a professor and a couple of students.\n\nIs it when you joined ? \nNo it was already a department. I did study first industrial engeneering in electronics. At the time in electronics you did hear something about computers, i was interested in it i wanted to know more. I heard Kuleuvenhad started a year before a degree in computer engeneering. It was the first year where industrial engineers could join. The only thing we knew about computer were from movies. I wanted to know how it work. I'm not sure if I know now it now, but I have some ideas...\n\nHow many langage do you know ?\nAssembly, FORTRAN, PL-1 the langage invented by IBM to be the universal one, C, Cobol. Perl, i don't know, some  more. I'm not fluent in any computer langage, but i can read any langage especially well written, I knowIi can understand it and, if neede,  learn it...I know JAVA also. As a system administrator the thing I use most are the command line of UNIX and Perl. But that's because i'm more familiar with those two so it goes faster.\n\nHow did you see the rise of personnal computer and the software that goes with ? \nI have to admit that we missed it. We didn't see the new thing was powerful because available for everybody.  We were not impressed by the software. I remember windows 95, the news on TV, people sleeping on the street to get it. I remember when i get my first windows version, with a box of 22 floppies or so. Then i wanted to do something, to compile a program, but there was no compiler... We were used to Unix, a basic system but with a lot of utilities in it. Software was for us free, and we were used to have it free and on a pc it was not free anymore. \n\nDoes that mean you didn't had a personnal computer until late ? \nYes. I think it was round 2000. I didn't needed it really. I got one when the belgian UUCP network became commercial. Of course i did not get Windows on it.  I think we got Linux here in 1994. There was a guy involved in the kernel studying here. So we did used it very fast.\n\nSo, what is software for you ?\nFor me software is the magic that make computer usable. I can only gives examples of what i mean by it. A PC without software most people, even computer scientists, can't do anything with it. You need basic software. Some software is already integrated in the computer hardware. Same for phones, tablets... The main characteristic, for me, is that it should be user friendly. That is very difficult i know, because you have to imagine what the people using your software are going to do with it and how they want to use it, that's the magic you need to solve.\n\nIs command line user friendly ? \nWell, somehow you have to learn the Unix command langage; it is in fact a computer langage where you can make all the constructs that other langages offers.\nYou can create loops, you can test, whatever. It's not so different from computer langages like C or JAVA or whatever.  It is certainly programmer friendly.\n\nBut it's already software no ? User friendly depends on what you put behind these words, no ? \nYes it's already software. I don't have a strong opinion about command lines. It depends on people. I can imagine that someone that have never heard about the command line expect that you click somewhere and it happens. But if you know the command langage it's sometimes perhaps easier or productive to type commands and let it run. Sometimes, i find it easier if i have a screen and a number of buttons and i don't have to imagine what happens behind that screen. And sometimes i want to do something with the command line, because i'm used to it. That's why i don't trust myself about user friendliness because i have a long experience in computer interfaces. I'm so used to some of them perhaps i can't even imagine that somebody else would like to do it otherwise or doesn't like what i'm used to.\n\nApart from maintaining the museum, what do you work on ? You are still active in the department even though you are retired ? \nI work on sensors, in the internet of things world in one of the university spin-off. What i do for them is: wireless sensors need power, most  of them are on batteries. They have designed a complete system which should make the battery lasts for two, three, four years. They need a system to measure that. So i been working on a mechanism to measure that without waiting four years. That's programming instrumentation computers to mesure power or whatever, that's part Unix systems. There are enough new or unknown things and maybe because i'm older, i have another way of looking at things, so we have a lot of discussions. They don't like my Pearl, they use python, JAVA those things...Pearl, it has it's disavantage, but you could do a lot of thing, each character has a meaning. With Python, you need all those libraries...It's easy when you know the libraries you have to call. When you know the arguments of the librairies...so it's also complicated. ANd if the library change for some reasons, there you go. In my humble opinion it's the same with all the langages. It's starts easy from scratch but if you have to interface them with existing thing from the internet world or whatever it gets complicated.\n\nDo you have a last word ? \nI was surprised by your group reaction to the visit. I thought all of this were known. Maybe i'm getting old :) Curently i don't do much about the museum department, but sometimes i like to talk about the little stories about it. I remember a lot of little stories, a lot of technics who have been used and forgotten and some kept alive. I thought when i was young that the best techniques would succeed. That you would have visionnary people who would see the way. But i realized that a lot of thing happens by accident.\n\n\n\n\n\n","attribs":"*6|1+1*0*a*b*c+1*0+t*6|1+1*5+3p*6|1+1*5+4f*6|2+2+1y*d+n+47*d+1+76*6|2+2+4n*6|1+1|1+1*5+11*6|2+2+1s*e+1+41*d+2+3a*e+k+1l*6|2+2+38*0+n+48*2+3f+2y*6|2+2+9i*d+1+14*d+1+3j*6|2+2+6i*d+8+15*6|2+2*5+1a*6|2+2+1b*d+1+1u*d+6+1y*6|2+2*5+19*6|2+2+2p*d+1+3f*d+a+o*d+1+1b*d+1+2*d+l+9*d+2a+1*e+14+19*d+1+1b*d+u+1*6|2+2*5+1r*6|2+2+d*d+4+1e*d+1+1v*d+a+9*d+1+1*d+1+r*d+u+1*d+n+e*d*e+4*e+8+1t*d+1+2*d+1+s*d+4+h*d|1+1+2r*d+9+1l*0+1+2s*d+3+33*6|1+1+41*6|2+2*5+1a*6|2+2+4h*d+4+x*6|2+2*5+2w*6|2+2+7u*d+4+q*d+9+f*d|1+1+f*d+1+27*d+1+7*d+1+9*d+1+t*d+2+w*d+6+e*d+e+2*d+2+r*d+m+g*d+9+q*e+i*d+1+3q*6|2+2*5+1f*6|2+2+43*0+1+f*0+2+4*d+a*e+3+1h*d+p+z*d+3+3z*d+1+10*d+4+5*d+3+1n*d+6+r*d+4+f*d+1+1o*d+1+j*d+c+17*d+h+8*d+11+p*0+33+1k*d+2+3f*d+4+1*6|1+1+x*0+f+1*0+12+1*0*2+1*0+37+2q*0+4+2*0|1+21*0+1f+1v*0+1+1*0*2+1*0+fh*d|1+1*d+1+1j*d+a+1z*0+1*d|1+1+d*d+t+7*d+2+4*d+5+1*d+2+1*d+l+1*d+c+n*d+p+14*d+1+1k*d+9+1r*d+p+1r*d+q+c*d+6+7*0|2+2*5+1v*0|1+1+3y*0+4+6i*0|2+2*5+5m*0|1+1+i*d+1+1*d+2+29*d+7+1*0|1+1+1*d+2+1f*d+7+4*d+1+9*d+6+z*d+1+11*d+1+1*2+e*d*2+1*2+e*d*2+1*2+b+83*d+1j+2*0|1+1+1*0|1+1+1*5+1y*0|1+1+1u*d+1+f*d+5+1k*d+3+1*d+6+96*d|1+1+90*d|1+1+1h*d+8+m*d+o+m*d+b+10*e+9+1*d+1+2j*d+35+r*0|1+1+1*0|1+1*5+4t*0|1+1+1d*d+6+z*d+1+6*d+2+1h*d+5+5*d+5+9*d+c+73*d+6+8*d+4+b*d+3+i*d+3+n*d+3*0|1+1+3o*d+9+a*d+5+89*d+b+2p*d|1+1+5p*d+i+7*d+1+1*d|1+1*d+1a+7p*0|2+2*5+x*0|1+1+5q*0|2+2*5+1q*0|1+1+1f*d+3+4g*0|2+2*5+16*0|1+1+5b*0|1+1+3l*0|2+2*5+o*0|1+1+18*d+5+4h*d+8+e*e+d+28*d+1+1k*d+4+1h*d+4+9*d+e+i*0|2+2*5+u*0|1+1+31*d+3+t*d+8+1q*d+2+4*d+1+n*d+c+1t*d+2+3b*0|2+2*5+29*0|1+1+1f*d+2+4*d+6+c*d+y+7s*d+2+3s*d+8+p*0|2+2*5+1s*0|1+1+2f*d+1+57*0|2+2*5+u*0|1+1+6f*d+3+91*0|2+2*5+w*0|1+1+10*d+5+f*d+4+2o*0|1+1+3b*d+11*0|2+2*5+2m*0|1+1+m9*0|2+2*5+3i*0|1+1+2z*d+1+a*d+8+c*d+5+tr*0|2+2*5+q*0|1+1+eh*0|1+1*6|3+3*0|1+1|1+1"}}},"pad:observatory.guide.jeanhuensitvextended:revs:9001":{"changeset":"Z:f5b<1|2t=ds5=8m-1$","meta":{"author":"a.T2VW9Z1FoOo412v8","timestamp":1518190433621}},"pad:observatory.guide.jeanhuensitvextended:revs:9002":{"changeset":"Z:f5a>1|2t=ds5=8m*d+1$I","meta":{"author":"a.T2VW9Z1FoOo412v8","timestamp":1518190434422}},"pad:observatory.guide.jeanhuensitvextended:revs:9003":{"changeset":"Z:f5b>1|2t=ds5=8n*d+1$

Huens interview extended\n**You have been using computers since a long time, as you explained us during the tour we had the joy of assisting during the TGSO.**\n**I heard that that until recently, let's say the late 1990's, when learning computer programming you had to start by  writing down the program on paper... ** \n\nIn 1973, i did study computer sciences, it was the second year of the Computer Sciense course, here in Leuven. At the time computers were mainframes and you did fed them with programms by punch cards. Programing was writing down the program, then you punched it and the next day you get results, mostly error. That's the way it worked at that time. To teach us programing, they used the langage of that time, Fortran and some kind of invented assembly langage, it didn't really exist, it was simplified.\n\nMost of the time you did write down your program, the teacher and the assistant would have to tell you what is wrong or good, you didn't had much practical experience.\n\n**How was it like, tons of pages ?** \n\nNo. As an anecdocte, i remember punchcards were a block of papers, we were jealous of the people who came in the computer center with huge stacks of cards. That were really small programs, not complicated one. In fact you had to learn to use the computer from scratch, everything was new, you couldn't rely on previous experiences, everything was new. And to start with small programs was difficult enough. \n\nThat was also the time when Edsger W. Dijkstra, who faught against the goto and other then common but bad constructs [@[tdijksra:1972:goto]. I still remember him, in an audience, giving us a lecture on good  techniques  in programming at the  International computing symposium 1977 in Liège (programming:  from craft to scientific discipline https://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/EWD/transcriptions/EWD05xx/EWD566.html). It was a rather hard course because Dijkstra expected you to quickly  understand and implement his ideas.\n\nAnd then from 75 on, computers became cheaper and could be bought by departments and smaller entities. And than came the first interactive computer. Still beasts about two cubic meters, costing two millions belgian francs. But it was low enough to allow people to type in directly commands. I started working here in 75 as a researcher, it has evolved continuously and i saw computers getting cheaper and getting easier to use.The way to use it was simplified, you could start to go to the beast and try it out.\n\nI remember more or less: you did write down the program in Fortran for instance… We always thought in the beginning that it would work and it didn't, so after a turn around you were giving it back to the operator and you have to wait another half a day or a night to get the results.\n\n**What kind of program you were working on?** \n\nI remember the first program i had to write was: you got three numbers, you had to make the program decide if you could construct a triangle with the numbers being the sides of the triangle.\n\n**That took an afternoon to be processed ?** \n\nWell, yeah. You had to imagine how to do it which was also one problem, than you prepare the cards with the punching machine and you give the package of cards to the operator who was feeeding the computer with the cards. Operator people had the taks to feed the computers by hands, with paper, cards, then cards got written on disks and later processed by the mainframe from disk. Finally results got printed on paper. it lasts onto the magnetic disks period. And after a number of hours or a night you got a listing, a piece of paper, with the results or program compilation errors.\n\n**When where you able to record the program onto the machine?**\n\nI think that did happen between 75 and 80. After the punching cards, which was already a way to record the program, we had  typewriters and then terminals. We could record the programs by typing it on the terminal  and the computer would store them on disk. We had magnetic discs. IBM had number for everything, i remember the 3300  [manufactured from 1970 on] was a magnetic disk. \nWe didn't touch the machines, operators would change the disks, we could only access the typewriter/terminal. That was our most direct connexion to the computer. The times were diffent. The mainframes were such huge costly beasts that it had operators day and night to keep it busy. Even at night there were two or three guys mounting tapes, dismounting tapes, that kind of stuff.\nhttps://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/42/IBM_magnetic_disk_drives_3330%2B3333.png/600px-IBM_magnetic_disk_drives_3330%2B3333.png\n\n**When did you stop working with operators?** \n\nSomewhere between 85 and 90. There were still operators at the main computer of the university, but there were also small computers, so researchers and student could have direct access when needed. \n\n**When did you start to work with software sold by others or gived away in order to do your research?** \n\nYou stil need an operating system on the mainframe that was delivered by IBM or the constructor delivering the mainframe. When you bought mini-computers, which were the  smaller versions of mainframes, in most cases you did buy an operating systems, compilers and all the stuff you did need to be able to program or work  those things. \nIn most cases,  the computer sciences department did buy the mini-computer from, for instance *Digital Equipment Corporation*,  a manufactorer at that time, but they didn't buy DEC's  software. The DEC software  was not open source or free,  and as a university we could get Unix for free and could run it on those digital equipment  DEC computers. That is what the computer department of the University of Louvain la Neuve *l'unité d'informatique*, did and so did we.\n\n**When did you start working with unix as an os?** \n\nI took a trip to Amsterdam, it must have been in 1979/80… Well, the story starts in our french sister university (LLN) where they did have a PDP-11 with Unix on it. You could get got Unix, at the time, when you were a university, from Bell Labs ( part of AT&T ), the american telephone company. ATT was a mega organisation at the time [before the [dismantlment of AT&T/Bell system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breakup_of_the_Bell_System)]. Due to monopoly, the US authorities did split it up in different Baby Bells. One of the restriction was that the  research baby bell,  could not sell anything. There were computer scientists there, who did developped some interesting things (e.g. Unix).  For universities you did get the source for free, but NO  support, nothing not even how to install it. In Unité d'informatique, where they had a PDP-11/70 https://i0.wp.com/www.utterpower.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/pdp11-70-panel.jpg  they were lucky: they got the same computer that unix was developped on.  They got the disk by snail mail as a post-office package. They mounted it and it did spin up and they had UNIX.\nHere, we did have a cheaper PDP11, the PDP 11/60  (https://dave.cheney.net/tag/pdp-11). We got the Unix disk distribution from Bell Labs but we could not run it, because we got another type of disk(RK07). We could look at it but that was all, because our disc format was different than the one at Bell Labs. Somebody here (P.Verbaeten) did write a driver for that disk in l'unité \nd'informatique of LLN. But they did not have a RK07.  it did compile it but we couldn't try it because we did not have. The nearest place  with Unix and RK07 was in Vrije Universiteit  Amsterdam.  Andrew Tenebaum, who did write a number of books on operating systems, was working there. He was learning to speak dutch. We did understood his english better but his assistant explained that he needed to practice speaking Dutch because he would have to pass an exam. There we compiled Unix with an RK07 driver and stored it on a bootable RK07 disk. With that disk back in Leuven we could start  Unix on our PDP11/60. An error in the process meant a trip Leuven-Amsterdam and back.\nIn my opinion the start of open source was Unix because everybody  had to maintain it by ourselves and we learned a lot from the sources. \nIn that time for software distribution you did have to store it on magnetic tape and send the tape us to different places with associated problems. For example,  the agents at the customs at the airport or post didn't know what to do with the tapes or discs in terms of custom clearance. They used magnetic or xrays as inspection tools and  we had to write on the package that it should not be x-rayed. and sometimes we still got unreadable tapes/discs. \n\n**So it took like weeks between the transportation, the custom...**\nYes, the custom had to clear the packages. I remember i've been in the customs in Zaventem. I had received a letter that my package from Bell Labs had arrived. I went there thinking i would have to pay something and go. But no. It had to be cleared so there wa some organisation that had to do administrative stuff, so i only got it a few days later. The response time was huge :)\n\n**Than after that period of time how did you switch from that kind of collaboration on how to make software and make software work to collaboration on networks, between universities and researchers...**\nIn the Unix systems at that time there was a kind of networking protocol which did work on serial lines (UUCP).\n To connect two unix systems together you only need a serial line . We had a line between LLN and Leuven, it's only 25 kms, but we had to ask Belgacom, then La Régie des Télégraphes et Téléphones, to get a modem to connect through their network and than over that modem you could reach an amazing speed of 300 characters per second. And that was the first communication. It did happened somewhere around 85. And then you had connexion with another computer, writing something here and do the transfer to the other computer and execute it there. \n \n **What was the first thing you did send through a network like this?**\n I didn't do it myself, i remember it was a kind of chat program. On LLN side was Prof.Elie Milgrom, he is retired now. On this side, it was Prof.  Yves Willems. And i remember that they typed something and they got a response from the other side and that was it.  But i remember that Pr Willems sent \"ok we stop now\". And that Elie Milgrom answered \"See you later, Alligator\" [a reference to Bill Haley and the Comets].  At the time we still had these kind of songs in mind. (lol). \nThose Unix to Unix connexions were first. And there was a worldwide Unix to Unix based network, Usenet (1979), it still exists somewhere... you can download load  of illegal movies and that stuff, that was not what we meant at the time. But that is what is left. And Usenet became gradually replaced by the Internet in USA. \nIn Europe, the Internet came a lot later, but we had limited access to the Internet by mail and even FTP; We could send mail to the Internet and we could receive mail from them, because Some friendly american university, later companies, did translate internet mail to UCP mail., moreover they did translate specially formatted mails into FTP request and send the result back to us by mail. That was before the 1990's.\n \n **Your relation to software had changed at the time because you did not have to do all this manipulations with the software your received... Was it already floppy discs ?**\n No, magnetic tapes, for the mainframe at least. Even most of the mini-computers had some (cheaper) magnetic tapes. Between 90 and 95 the main machines used for  Unix software development was a VAX from DEC. Once a year the software came from Berkeley, it was still Unix but modified by Berkeley for virtual memory and all the stuff which are common now. We received a tape, with lot of goodies, i still remember we didn't know what was on the tape  but we did scrutinise it  to know what was on there, what we can use....\nIn Europe, companies like Siemens were trying to set up software centers to make software avaiable, they were even trying to set up European networks. But researchers did love the Internet, it worked, it was useful for their researchs. So companies in Europe, were trying to set up their own networks, i remember for example the X/OPEN transport protocol. Their was a lot of standards about what software layers should do, but it didn't succeed because around 1992  IBM decided to quit their own private network and to go forTCP/IP and was the switching point. \nEverything done for X/OPEN were suddently forgotten. For the mainframes, and certainly in Belgium computing was mainly mainframes, i'm talking about universities here, so when IBM decided to go for TCP/IP Univiversities did follow. \nBut the aceptation of TCP/IP was really slow. For example, Belgacom was not interested in running the Domain Name System so we did it here, for some time, starting in 1993 with Pierre Verbaten (https://www.dnsbelgium.be/en/history). Belgacom were focused on X25 (DCS - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X.25) so they missed it.\n\nIt was like the french Minitel ? \nWell, at that time we were really jealous about Minitel. Could you imagine that? Terminals?  At home ? You could work home with a computer ! You could send emails ! All in one, a pc computer with a modem ! \n\nHow did the research about software evolved in the department?\nI am mainly talking about network research but here. Tthere were people working on numerical analysis, computing, artificial intelligence ... I was just not involved in those research so i don't know much about it \n\nYou were focused on software and network..\nYes, we did produce some software. We did make software to generate compilers, there was some A.I. software in Prolog, numerical analysis  libraries... Some were sold or shared, it depends.  \nWe did sell some software since the beginning i think when it was not even a department but a professor and a couple of students.\n\nIs it when you joined ? \nNo it was already a department. I did study first industrial engeneering in electronics. At the time in electronics you did hear something about computers, i was interested in it i wanted to know more. I heard Kuleuvenhad started a year before a degree in computer engeneering. It was the first year where industrial engineers could join. The only thing we knew about computer were from movies. I wanted to know how it work. I'm not sure if I know now it now, but I have some ideas...\n\nHow many langage do you know ?\nAssembly, FORTRAN, PL-1 the langage invented by IBM to be the universal one, C, Cobol. Perl, i don't know, some  more. I'm not fluent in any computer langage, but i can read any langage especially well written, I knowIi can understand it and, if neede,  learn it...I know JAVA also. As a system administrator the thing I use most are the command line of UNIX and Perl. But that's because i'm more familiar with those two so it goes faster.\n\nHow did you see the rise of personnal computer and the software that goes with ? \nI have to admit that we missed it. We didn't see the new thing was powerful because available for everybody.  We were not impressed by the software. I remember windows 95, the news on TV, people sleeping on the street to get it. I remember when i get my first windows version, with a box of 22 floppies or so. Then i wanted to do something, to compile a program, but there was no compiler... We were used to Unix, a basic system but with a lot of utilities in it. Software was for us free, and we were used to have it free and on a pc it was not free anymore. \n\nDoes that mean you didn't had a personnal computer until late ? \nYes. I think it was round 2000. I didn't needed it really. I got one when the belgian UUCP network became commercial. Of course i did not get Windows on it.  I think we got Linux here in 1994. There was a guy involved in the kernel studying here. So we did used it very fast.\n\nSo, what is software for you ?\nFor me software is the magic that make computer usable. I can only gives examples of what i mean by it. A PC without software most people, even computer scientists, can't do anything with it. You need basic software. Some software is already integrated in the computer hardware. Same for phones, tablets... The main characteristic, for me, is that it should be user friendly. That is very difficult i know, because you have to imagine what the people using your software are going to do with it and how they want to use it, that's the magic you need to solve.\n\nIs command line user friendly ? \nWell, somehow you have to learn the Unix command langage; it is in fact a computer langage where you can make all the constructs that other langages offers.\nYou can create loops, you can test, whatever. It's not so different from computer langages like C or JAVA or whatever.  It is certainly programmer friendly.\n\nBut it's already software no ? User friendly depends on what you put behind these words, no ? \nYes it's already software. I don't have a strong opinion about command lines. It depends on people. I can imagine that someone that have never heard about the command line expect that you click somewhere and it happens. But if you know the command langage it's sometimes perhaps easier or productive to type commands and let it run. Sometimes, i find it easier if i have a screen and a number of buttons and i don't have to imagine what happens behind that screen. And sometimes i want to do something with the command line, because i'm used to it. That's why i don't trust myself about user friendliness because i have a long experience in computer interfaces. I'm so used to some of them perhaps i can't even imagine that somebody else would like to do it otherwise or doesn't like what i'm used to.\n\nApart from maintaining the museum, what do you work on ? You are still active in the department even though you are retired ? \nI work on sensors, in the internet of things world in one of the university spin-off. What i do for them is: wireless sensors need power, most  of them are on batteries. They have designed a complete system which should make the battery lasts for two, three, four years. They need a system to measure that. So I have been working on a mechanism to measure that without waiting four years. That's programming instrumentation computers to measure e.g. power or whatever. Most of it on  Unix systems. \nThere are enough new or unknown things and maybe because i'm older, i have another way of looking at things, so we have a lot of discussions. They don't like my Perl, they use python, JAVA and hose things... Perl, it has it's disavantage, but you can do a lot of things. Every  character has a meaning, that makes perl programs often unreadable.\nWith Python, you need all those libraries...It's easy when you know the libraries, waht  you have to call. When you know the arguments of the librairies...so it's also complicated. ANd if the library changes for some reasons, there you go.\n In my humble opinion it's the same with all the langages. It starts easy from scratch but if you have to interface them with existing things from the internet world or whatever it gets complicated.\n\nDo you have a last word ? \nI was surprised by your group reaction to the visit. I thought all of this was known. Maybe i'm getting old :) Curently i don't do much about the museum department, but sometimes i like to talk about the little stories about it. I remember a lot of little stories, a lot of technics who have been used and forgotten and some kept alive. I thought when i was young that the best techniques would succeed. That you would have visionnary people who would see the way. But i realized that a lot of thing happens by

At the time computers were mainframes and you did feed them with programms by punch cards. Programming was writing down the program, then you punched it and the next day you get results, mostly error. That's the way it worked at that time. To teach us programming, they used the langage of that time, Fortran and some kind of invented assembly langage, it didn't really exist, it was simplified.\n\nMost of the time you did write down your program, the teacher and the assistant would have to tell you what is wrong or good, you didn't had much practical experience.\n\n**What was it like, tons of pages ?** \n\nNo. As an anecdocte, i remember punchcards were a block of papers, we were jealous of the people who came into the computer center with huge stacks of cards. They were really small programs, not complicated one. In fact you had to learn to use the computer from scratch, everything was new, you couldn't rely on previous experiences, everything was new. And to start with small programs was difficult enough. \n\nThat was also the time when Edsger W. Dijkstra, who fought against the goto and other common but bad constructs [@[tdijksra:1972:goto]. I still remember him, in an audience, giving us a lecture on good  techniques in programming at the International computing symposium 1977 in Liège [@[dijksra:1977:craft]. It was a rather hard course because Dijkstra expected you to quickly  understand and implement his ideas.\n\nAnd then from '75 on, computers became cheaper and could be bought by departments and smaller entities. And than came the first interactive computer. Still beasts about two cubic meters, costing two millions belgian francs. But it was low enough to allow people to type in directly commands. I started working here in '75 as a researcher, it has evolved continuously and I saw computers getting cheaper and getting easier to use.The way to use it was simplified, you could start to go to the beast and try it out.\n\nI remember more or less: you wrote down the program in Fortran for instance. We always thought in the beginning that it would work and it didn't, so after a turn around you were giving it back to the operator and you have to wait another half a day or a night to get the results.\n\n**What kind of program you were working on?** \n\nI remember the first program i had to write was: you got three numbers, you had to make the program decide if you could construct a triangle with the numbers being the sides of the triangle.\n\n**That took an afternoon to be processed?** \n\nWell, yeah. You had to imagine how to do it which was also one problem, than you prepare the cards with the punching machine and you give the package of cards to the operator who was feeeding the computer with the cards. Operator people had the taks to feed the computers by hands, with paper, cards, then cards got written on disks and later processed by the mainframe from disk. Finally results got printed on paper. it lasts onto the magnetic disks period. And after a number of hours or a night you got a listing, a piece of paper, with the results or program compilation errors.\n\n**When where you able to record the program onto the machine?**\n\nI think that happened between '75 and '80. After the punching cards, which were already a way to record the program, we had typewriters and then terminals. We could record the programs by typing it on the terminal  and the computer would store them on disk. We had magnetic discs. IBM had number for everything, i remember the 3300  [manufactured from 1970 on] was a magnetic disk. \nWe didn't touch the machines, operators would change the disks, we could only access the typewriter/terminal. That was our most direct connexion to the computer. The times were diffent. The mainframes were such huge costly beasts that it had operators day and night to keep it busy. Even at night there were two or three guys mounting tapes, dismounting tapes, that kind of stuff.\nhttps://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/42/IBM_magnetic_disk_drives_3330%2B3333.png/600px-IBM_magnetic_disk_drives_3330%2B3333.png\n\n**When did you stop working with operators?** \n\nSomewhere between '85 and '90. There were still operators at the main computer of the university, but there were also small computers, so researchers and student could have direct access when needed. \n\n**When did you start to work with software sold by others or given away in order to do your research?** \n\nYou still need an operating system on the mainframe that was delivered by IBM or the constructor delivering the mainframe. When you bought mini-computers, which were the  smaller versions of mainframes, in most cases you did buy an operating systems, compilers and all the stuff you did need to be able to program or work  those things. \nIn most cases,  the computer sciences department did buy the mini-computer from, for instance *Digital Equipment Corporation*,  a manufactorer at that time, but they didn't buy DEC's  software. The DEC software  was not open source or free,  and as a university we could get Unix for free and could run it on those digital equipment  DEC computers. That is what the computer department of the University of Louvain la Neuve *l'unité d'informatique*, did and so did we.\n\n**When did you start working with unix as an os?** \n\nI took a trip to Amsterdam, it must have been in 1979/80… Well, the story starts in our french sister university (LLN) where they did have a PDP-11 with Unix on it. You could get got Unix, at the time, when you were a university, from Bell Labs ( part of AT&T ), the american telephone company. ATT was a mega organisation at the time [before the [dismantlment of AT&T/Bell system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breakup_of_the_Bell_System)]. Due to monopoly, the US authorities did split it up in different Baby Bells. One of the restriction was that the  research baby bell,  could not sell anything. There were computer scientists there, who did developped some interesting things (e.g. Unix).  For universities you did get the source for free, but NO  support, nothing not even how to install it. In Unité d'informatique, where they had a PDP-11/70 https://i0.wp.com/www.utterpower.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/pdp11-70-panel.jpg  they were lucky: they got the same computer that unix was developped on.  They got the disk by snail mail as a post-office package. They mounted it and it did spin up and they had UNIX.\nHere, we did have a cheaper PDP11, the PDP 11/60  (https://dave.cheney.net/tag/pdp-11). We got the Unix disk distribution from Bell Labs but we could not run it, because we got another type of disk(RK07). We could look at it but that was all, because our disc format was different than the one at Bell Labs. Somebody here (P.Verbaeten) did write a driver for that disk in l'unité \nd'informatique of LLN. But they did not have a RK07.  it did compile it but we couldn't try it because we did not have. The nearest place  with Unix and RK07 was in Vrije Universiteit  Amsterdam.  Andrew Tenebaum, who did write a number of books on operating systems, was working there. He was learning to speak dutch. We did understood his english better but his assistant explained that he needed to practice speaking Dutch because he would have to pass an exam. There we compiled Unix with an RK07 driver and stored it on a bootable RK07 disk. With that disk back in Leuven we could start  Unix on our PDP11/60. An error in the process meant a trip Leuven-Amsterdam and back.\nIn my opinion the start of open source was Unix because everybody  had to maintain it by ourselves and we learned a lot from the sources. \nIn that time for software distribution you did have to store it on magnetic tape and send the tape us to different places with associated problems. For example,  the agents at the customs at the airport or post didn't know what to do with the tapes or discs in terms of custom clearance. They used magnetic or xrays as inspection tools and  we had to write on the package that it should not be x-rayed. and sometimes we still got unreadable tapes/discs. \n\n**So it took like weeks between the transportation, the custom...**\nYes, the custom had to clear the packages. I remember i've been in the customs in Zaventem. I had received a letter that my package from Bell Labs had arrived. I went there thinking i would have to pay something and go. But no. It had to be cleared so there wa some organisation that had to do administrative stuff, so i only got it a few days later. The response time was huge :)\n\n**Than after that period of time how did you switch from that kind of collaboration on how to make software and make software work to collaboration on networks, between universities and researchers...**\nIn the Unix systems at that time there was a kind of networking protocol which did work on serial lines (UUCP).\n To connect two unix systems together you only need a serial line . We had a line between LLN and Leuven, it's only 25 kms, but we had to ask Belgacom, then La Régie des Télégraphes et Téléphones, to get a modem to connect through their network and than over that modem you could reach an amazing speed of 300 characters per second. And that was the first communication. It did happened somewhere around 85. And then you had connexion with another computer, writing something here and do the transfer to the other computer and execute it there. \n \n **What was the first thing you did send through a network like this?**\n I didn't do it myself, i remember it was a kind of chat program. On LLN side was Prof.Elie Milgrom, he is retired now. On this side, it was Prof.  Yves Willems. And i remember that they typed something and they got a response from the other side and that was it.  But i remember that Pr Willems sent \"ok we stop now\". And that Elie Milgrom answered \"See you later, Alligator\" [a reference to Bill Haley and the Comets].  At the time we still had these kind of songs in mind. (lol). \nThose Unix to Unix connexions were first. And there was a worldwide Unix to Unix based network, Usenet (1979), it still exists somewhere... you can download load  of illegal movies and that stuff, that was not what we meant at the time. But that is what is left. And Usenet became gradually replaced by the Internet in USA. \nIn Europe, the Internet came a lot later, but we had limited access to the Internet by mail and even FTP; We could send mail to the Internet and we could receive mail from them, because Some friendly american university, later companies, did translate internet mail to UCP mail., moreover they did translate specially formatted mails into FTP request and send the result back to us by mail. That was before the 1990's.\n \n **Your relation to software had changed at the time because you did not have to do all this manipulations with the software your received... Was it already floppy discs ?**\n No, magnetic tapes, for the mainframe at least. Even most of the mini-computers had some (cheaper) magnetic tapes. Between 90 and 95 the main machines used for  Unix software development was a VAX from DEC. Once a year the software came from Berkeley, it was still Unix but modified by Berkeley for virtual memory and all the stuff which are common now. We received a tape, with lot of goodies, i still remember we didn't know what was on the tape  but we did scrutinise it  to know what was on there, what we can use....\nIn Europe, companies like Siemens were trying to set up software centers to make software avaiable, they were even trying to set up European networks. But researchers did love the Internet, it worked, it was useful for their researchs. So companies in Europe, were trying to set up their own networks, i remember for example the X/OPEN transport protocol. Their was a lot of standards about what software layers should do, but it didn't succeed because around 1992  IBM decided to quit their own private network and to go forTCP/IP and was the switching point. \nEverything done for X/OPEN were suddently forgotten. For the mainframes, and certainly in Belgium computing was mainly mainframes, i'm talking about universities here, so when IBM decided to go for TCP/IP Univiversities did follow. \nBut the aceptation of TCP/IP was really slow. For example, Belgacom was not interested in running the Domain Name System so we did it here, for some time, starting in 1993 with Pierre Verbaten (https://www.dnsbelgium.be/en/history). Belgacom were focused on X25 (DCS - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X.25) so they missed it.\n\nIt was like the french Minitel ? \nWell, at that time we were really jealous about Minitel. Could you imagine that? Terminals?  At home ? You could work home with a computer ! You could send emails ! All in one, a pc computer with a modem ! \n\nHow did the research about software evolved in the department?\nI am mainly talking about network research but here. Tthere were people working on numerical analysis, computing, artificial intelligence ... I was just not involved in those research so i don't know much about it \n\nYou were focused on software and network..\nYes, we did produce some software. We did make software to generate compilers, there was some A.I. software in Prolog, numerical analysis  libraries... Some were sold or shared, it depends.  \nWe did sell some software since the beginning i think when it was not even a department but a professor and a couple of students.\n\nIs it when you joined ? \nNo it was already a department. I did study first industrial engeneering in electronics. At the time in electronics you did hear something about computers, i was interested in it i wanted to know more. I heard Kuleuvenhad started a year before a degree in computer engeneering. It was the first year where industrial engineers could join. The only thing we knew about computer were from movies. I wanted to know how it work. I'm not sure if I know now it now, but I have some ideas...\n\nHow many langage do you know ?\nAssembly, FORTRAN, PL-1 the langage invented by IBM to be the universal one, C, Cobol. Perl, i don't know, some  more. I'm not fluent in any computer langage, but i can read any langage especially well written, I knowIi can understand it and, if neede,  learn it...I know JAVA also. As a system administrator the thing I use most are the command line of UNIX and Perl. But that's because i'm more familiar with those two so it goes faster.\n\nHow did you see the rise of personnal computer and the software that goes with ? \nI have to admit that we missed it. We didn't see the new thing was powerful because available for everybody.  We were not impressed by the software. I remember windows 95, the news on TV, people sleeping on the street to get it. I remember when i get my first windows version, with a box of 22 floppies or so. Then i wanted to do something, to compile a program, but there was no compiler... We were used to Unix, a basic system but with a lot of utilities in it. Software was for us free, and we were used to have it free and on a pc it was not free anymore. \n\nDoes that mean you didn't had a personnal computer until late ? \nYes. I think it was round 2000. I didn't needed it really. I got one when the belgian UUCP network became commercial. Of course i did not get Windows on it.  I think we got Linux here in 1994. There was a guy involved in the kernel studying here. So we did used it very fast.\n\nSo, what is software for you ?\nFor me software is the magic that make computer usable. I can only gives examples of what i mean by it. A PC without software most people, even computer scientists, can't do anything with it. You need basic software. Some software is already integrated in the computer hardware. Same for phones, tablets... The main characteristic, for me, is that it should be user friendly. That is very difficult i know, because you have to imagine what the people using your software are going to do with it and how they want to use it, that's the magic you need to solve.\n\nIs command line user friendly ? \nWell, somehow you have to learn the Unix command langage; it is in fact a computer langage where you can make all the constructs that other langages offers.\nYou can create loops, you can test, whatever. It's not so different from computer langages like C or JAVA or whatever.  It is certainly programmer friendly.\n\nBut it's already software no ? User friendly depends on what you put behind these words, no ? \nYes it's already software. I don't have a strong opinion about command lines. It depends on people. I can imagine that someone that have never heard about the command line expect that you click somewhere and it happens. But if you know the command langage it's sometimes perhaps easier or productive to type commands and let it run. Sometimes, i find it easier if i have a screen and a number of buttons and i don't have to imagine what happens behind that screen. And sometimes i want to do something with the command line, because i'm used to it. That's why i don't trust myself about user friendliness because i have a long experience in computer interfaces. I'm so used to some of them perhaps i can't even imagine that somebody else would like to do it otherwise or doesn't like what i'm used to.\n\nApart from maintaining the museum, what do you work on ? You are still active in the department even though you are retired ? \nI work on sensors, in the internet of things world in one of the university spin-off. What i do for them is: wireless sensors need power, most  of them are on batteries. They have designed a complete system which should make the battery lasts for two, three, four years. They need a system to measure that. So I have been working on a mechanism to measure that without waiting four years. That's programming instrumentation computers to measure e.g. power or whatever. Most of it on  Unix systems. \nThere are enough new or unknown things and maybe because i'm older, i have another way of looking at things, so we have a lot of discussions. They don't like my Perl, they use python, JAVA and hose things... Perl, it has it's disavantage, but you can do a lot of things. Every  character has a meaning, that makes perl programs often unreadable.\nWith Python, you need all those libraries...It's easy when you know the libraries, waht  you have to call. When you know the arguments of the librairies...so it's also complicated. ANd if the library changes for some reasons, there you go.\n In my humble opinion it's the same with all the langages. It starts easy from scratch but if you have to interface them with existing things from the internet world or whatever it gets complicated.\n\nDo you have a last word ? \nI was surprised by your group reaction to the visit. I thought all of this was known. Maybe i'm getting old :) Curently i don't do much about the museum department, but sometimes i like to talk about the little stories about it. I remember a lot of little stories, a lot of technics who have been used and forgotten and some kept alive. I thought when i was young that the best techniques would succeed. That you would have visionnary people who would see the way. But i realized that a lot of things do happen by accident.\n\n\n\n\n\n","attribs":"*g+1*0+t*g|3+x*6|1+1*5+2y*f*5+8*5+j*6|1+1*5+4f*6|2+2+9*f+1+1o*d+n+1y*f+1+19*f+1+10*d+1+3e*f+1+3s*6|2+2+4n*6|1+1|1+1*5+2*f*5+4*5+w*6|2+2+1s*e+1+17*f+2+1e*f+2+1e*d+2+3a*e+k+1l*6|2+2+1h*f+5+1h*0+n+45*0+n+2z*6|2+2+e*f+1+8f*f+1+p*d+1+q*f+1+d*d+1+3j*6|2+2+t*f+6+14*f+2+49*d+8+15*6|2+2*5+1a*6|2+2+1b*d+1+1u*d+6+1y*6|2+2*5+18*6|2+2+2p*d+1+3f*d+a+o*d+1+1b*d+1+2*d+l+9*d+2a+1*e+14+19*d+1+1b*d+u+1*6|2+2*5+1r*6|2+2+c*d+1+6*f+2+9*f+1+7*f+1+s*d+1+8*f+3+1k*d+a+9*d+1+1*d+1+r*d+u+1*d+n+e*d*e+4*e+8+1t*d+1+2*d+1+s*d+4+h*d|1+1+2r*d+9+1l*0+1+2s*d+3+33*6|1+1+41*6|2+2*5+1a*6|2+2+i*f+1+7*f+1+3s*d+4+x*6|2+2*5+1t*f*5+1*5+12*6|2+2+8*f+1+7m*d+4+q*d+9+f*d|1+1+f*d+1+27*d+1+7*d+1+9*d+1+t*d+2+w*d+6+e*d+e+2*d+2+r*d+m+g*d+9+q*e+i*d+1+3q*6|2+2*5+1f*6|2+2+43*0+1+f*0+2+4*d+a*e+3+1h*d+p+z*d+3+3z*d+1+10*d+4+5*d+3+1n*d+6+r*d+4+f*d+1+1o*d+1+j*d+c+17*d+h+8*d+11+p*0+33+1k*d+2+3f*d+4+1*6|1+1+x*0+f+1*0+12+1*0*2+1*0+37+2q*0+4+2*0|1+21*0+1f+1v*0+1+1*0*2+1*0+fh*d|1+1*d+1+1j*d+a+1z*0+1*d|1+1+d*d+t+7*d+2+4*d+5+1*d+2+1*d+l+1*d+c+n*d+p+14*d+1+1k*d+9+1r*d+p+1r*d+q+c*d+6+7*0|2+2*5+1v*0|1+1+3y*0+4+6i*0|2+2*5+5m*0|1+1+i*d+1+1*d+2+29*d+7+1*0|1+1+1*d+2+1f*d+7+4*d+1+9*d+6+z*d+1+11*d+1+1*2+e*d*2+1*2+e*d*2+1*2+b+83*d+1j+2*0|1+1+1*0|1+1+1*5+1y*0|1+1+1u*d+1+f*d+5+1k*d+3+1*d+6+96*d|1+1+90*d|1+1+1h*d+8+m*d+o+m*d+b+10*e+9+1*d+1+2j*d+35+r*0|1+1+1*0|1+1*5+4t*0|1+1+1d*d+6+z*d+1+6*d+2+1h*d+5+5*d+5+9*d+c+73*d+6+8*d+4+b*d+3+i*d+3+n*d+3*0|1+1+3o*d+9+a*d+5+89*d+b+2p*d|1+1+5p*d+i+7*d+1+1*d|1+1*d+1a+7p*0|2+2*5+x*0|1+1+5q*0|2+2*5+1q*0|1+1+1f*d+3+4g*0|2+2*5+16*0|1+1+5b*0|1+1+3l*0|2+2*5+o*0|1+1+18*d+5+4h*d+8+e*e+d+28*d+1+1k*d+4+1h*d+4+9*d+e+i*0|2+2*5+u*0|1+1+31*d+3+t*d+8+1q*d+2+4*d+1+n*d+c+1t*d+2+3b*0|2+2*5+29*0|1+1+1f*d+2+4*d+6+c*d+y+7s*d+2+3s*d+8+p*0|2+2*5+1s*0|1+1+2f*d+1+57*0|2+2*5+u*0|1+1+6f*d+3+91*0|2+2*5+w*0|1+1+10*d+5+f*d+4+2o*0|1+1+3b*d+11*0|2+2*5+2m*0|1+1+m9*0|2+2*5+3i*0|1+1+2z*d+1+a*d+8+c*d+5+4n*d+6+3f*d+1+5*d+5+h*d+1+1*d+e+f*d|1+1+59*d+4+e*d+1+14*d+2+i*d+9+o*d|1+19+29*d+7+3a*d+1+w*d|1+1+3w*d+1+1l*0|2+2*5+q*0|1+1+24*d+2+bp*d+4+k*0|1+1*6|3+3*0|1+1|1+1"}}},"pad:observatory.guide.jeanhuensitvextended:revs:9201":{"changeset":"Z:f5d>1=1*g+1$

HEADER: Interview with Jean Huens\n\n[short intro, when where ... interview with Jan Heuns, xxxx Peggy ... ]\n\n**You have been using computers since a long time, as you explained us during the tour we had the joy of attending during the TGSO.\nI heard that that until recently, let's say the late 1990's, when learning computer programming you had to start by  writing down the program on paper...** \n\nIn 1973, I did study computer sciences, it was the second year of the Computer Sciense course, here in Leuven. At the time computers were mainframes and you did feed them with programms by punch cards. Programming was writing down the program, then you punched it and the next day you get results, mostly error. That's the way it worked at that time. To teach us programming, they used the langage of that time, Fortran and some kind of invented assembly langage, it didn't really exist, it was simplified.\n\nMost of the time you did write down your program, the teacher and the assistant would have to tell you what is wrong or good, you didn't had much practical experience.\n\n**What was it like, tons of pages?** \n\nNo. As an anecdocte, i remember punchcards were a block of papers, we were jealous of the people who came into the computer center with huge stacks of cards. They were really small programs, not complicated one. In fact you had to learn to use the computer from scratch, everything was new, you couldn't rely on previous experiences, everything was new. And to start with small programs was difficult enough. \n\nThat was also the time when Edsger W. Dijkstra, who fought against the goto and other common but bad constructs [@tdijksra:1972:goto]. I still remember him, in an audience, giving us a lecture on good  techniques in programming at the International computing symposium 1977 in Liège [@dijksra:1977:craft]. It was a rather hard course because Dijkstra expected you to quickly  understand and implement his ideas.\n\nAnd then from '75 on, computers became cheaper and could be bought by departments and smaller entities. And than came the first interactive computer. Still beasts about two cubic meters, costing two millions belgian francs. But it was low enough to allow people to type in directly commands. I started working here in '75 as a researcher, it has evolved continuously and I saw computers getting cheaper and getting easier to use.The way to use it was simplified, you could start to go to the beast and try it out.\n\nI remember more or less: you wrote down the program in Fortran for instance. We always thought in the beginning that it would work and it didn't, so after a turn around you were giving it back to the operator and you have to wait another half a day or a night to get the results.\n\n**What kind of program you were working on?** \n\nI remember the first program i had to write was: you got three numbers, you had to make the program decide if you could construct a triangle with the numbers being the sides of the triangle.\n\n**That took an afternoon to be processed?** \n\nWell, yeah. You had to imagine how to do it which was also one problem, than you prepare the cards with the punching machine and you give the package of cards to the operator who was feeeding the computer with the cards. Operator people had the taks to feed the computers by hands, with paper, cards, then cards got written on disks and later processed by the mainframe from disk. Finally results got printed on paper. it lasts onto the magnetic disks period. And after a number of hours or a night you got a listing, a piece of paper, with the results or program compilation errors.\n\n**When where you able to record the program onto the machine?**\n\nI think that happened between '75 and '80. After the punching cards, which were already a way to record the program, we had typewriters and then terminals. We could record the programs by typing it on the terminal  and the computer would store them on disk. We had magnetic discs. IBM had number for everything, i remember the 3300  [manufactured from 1970 on] was a magnetic disk. \nWe didn't touch the machines, operators would change the disks, we could only access the typewriter/terminal. That was our most direct connexion to the computer. The times were diffent. The mainframes were such huge costly beasts that it had operators day and night to keep it busy. Even at night there were two or three guys mounting tapes, dismounting tapes, that kind of stuff.\nhttps://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/42/IBM_magnetic_disk_drives_3330%2B3333.png/600px-IBM_magnetic_disk_drives_3330%2B3333.png\n\n**When did you stop working with operators?** \n\nSomewhere between '85 and '90. There were still operators at the main computer of the university, but there were also small computers, so researchers and student could have direct access when needed. \n\n**When did you start to work with software sold by others or given away in order to do your research?** \n\nYou still need an operating system on the mainframe that was delivered by IBM or the constructor delivering the mainframe. When you bought mini-computers, which were the  smaller versions of mainframes, in most cases you did buy an operating systems, compilers and all the stuff you did need to be able to program or work  those things. \nIn most cases,  the computer sciences department did buy the mini-computer from, for instance *Digital Equipment Corporation*,  a manufactorer at that time, but they didn't buy DEC's  software. The DEC software  was not open source or free,  and as a university we could get Unix for free and could run it on those digital equipment  DEC computers. That is what the computer department of the University of Louvain la Neuve *l'unité d'informatique*, did and so did we.\n\n**When did you start working with unix as an os?** \n\nI took a trip to Amsterdam, it must have been in 1979/80… Well, the story starts in our french sister university (LLN) where they did have a PDP-11 with Unix on it. You could get got Unix, at the time, when you were a university, from Bell Labs ( part of AT&T ), the american telephone company. ATT was a mega organisation at the time [before the [dismantlment of AT&T/Bell system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breakup_of_the_Bell_System)]. Due to monopoly, the US authorities did split it up in different Baby Bells. One of the restriction was that the  research baby bell,  could not sell anything. There were computer scientists there, who did developped some interesting things (e.g. Unix).  For universities you did get the source for free, but NO  support, nothing not even how to install it. In Unité d'informatique, where they had a PDP-11/70 https://i0.wp.com/www.utterpower.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/pdp11-70-panel.jpg  they were lucky: they got the same computer that unix was developped on.  They got the disk by snail mail as a post-office package. They mounted it and it did spin up and they had UNIX.\nHere, we did have a cheaper PDP11, the PDP 11/60  (https://dave.cheney.net/tag/pdp-11). We got the Unix disk distribution from Bell Labs but we could not run it, because we got another type of disk(RK07). We could look at it but that was all, because our disc format was different than the one at Bell Labs. Somebody here (P.Verbaeten) did write a driver for that disk in l'unité \nd'informatique of LLN. But they did not have a RK07.  it did compile it but we couldn't try it because we did not have. The nearest place  with Unix and RK07 was in Vrije Universiteit  Amsterdam.  Andrew Tenebaum, who did write a number of books on operating systems, was working there. He was learning to speak dutch. We did understood his english better but his assistant explained that he needed to practice speaking Dutch because he would have to pass an exam. There we compiled Unix with an RK07 driver and stored it on a bootable RK07 disk. With that disk back in Leuven we could start  Unix on our PDP11/60. An error in the process meant a trip Leuven-Amsterdam and back.\nIn my opinion the start of open source was Unix because everybody  had to maintain it by ourselves and we learned a lot from the sources. \nIn that time for software distribution you did have to store it on magnetic tape and send the tape us to different places with associated problems. For example,  the agents at the customs at the airport or post didn't know what to do with the tapes or discs in terms of custom clearance. They used magnetic or xrays as inspection tools and  we had to write on the package that it should not be x-rayed. and sometimes we still got unreadable tapes/discs. \n\n**So it took like weeks between the transportation, the custom...**\nYes, the custom had to clear the packages. I remember i've been in the customs in Zaventem. I had received a letter that my package from Bell Labs had arrived. I went there thinking i would have to pay something and go. But no. It had to be cleared so there wa some organisation that had to do administrative stuff, so i only got it a few days later. The response time was huge :)\n\n**Than after that period of time how did you switch from that kind of collaboration on how to make software and make software work to collaboration on networks, between universities and researchers...**\nIn the Unix systems at that time there was a kind of networking protocol which did work on serial lines (UUCP).\n To connect two unix systems together you only need a serial line . We had a line between LLN and Leuven, it's only 25 kms, but we had to ask Belgacom, then La Régie des Télégraphes et Téléphones, to get a modem to connect through their network and than over that modem you could reach an amazing speed of 300 characters per second. And that was the first communication. It did happened somewhere around 85. And then you had connexion with another computer, writing something here and do the transfer to the other computer and execute it there. \n \n **What was the first thing you did send through a network like this?**\n I didn't do it myself, i remember it was a kind of chat program. On LLN side was Prof.Elie Milgrom, he is retired now. On this side, it was Prof.  Yves Willems. And i remember that they typed something and they got a response from the other side and that was it.  But i remember that Pr Willems sent \"ok we stop now\". And that Elie Milgrom answered \"See you later, Alligator\" [a reference to Bill Haley and the Comets].  At the time we still had these kind of songs in mind. (lol). \nThose Unix to Unix connexions were first. And there was a worldwide Unix to Unix based network, Usenet (1979), it still exists somewhere... you can download load  of illegal movies and that stuff, that was not what we meant at the time. But that is what is left. And Usenet became gradually replaced by the Internet in USA. \nIn Europe, the Internet came a lot later, but we had limited access to the Internet by mail and even FTP; We could send mail to the Internet and we could receive mail from them, because Some friendly american university, later companies, did translate internet mail to UCP mail., moreover they did translate specially formatted mails into FTP request and send the result back to us by mail. That was before the 1990's.\n \n **Your relation to software had changed at the time because you did not have to do all this manipulations with the software your received... Was it already floppy discs?**\n No, magnetic tapes, for the mainframe at least. Even most of the mini-computers had some (cheaper) magnetic tapes. Between 90 and 95 the main machines used for  Unix software development was a VAX from DEC. Once a year the software came from Berkeley, it was still Unix but modified by Berkeley for virtual memory and all the stuff which are common now. We received a tape, with lot of goodies, i still remember we didn't know what was on the tape  but we did scrutinise it  to know what was on there, what we can use....\nIn Europe, companies like Siemens were trying to set up software centers to make software avaiable, they were even trying to set up European networks. But researchers did love the Internet, it worked, it was useful for their researchs. So companies in Europe, were trying to set up their own networks, i remember for example the X/OPEN transport protocol. Their was a lot of standards about what software layers should do, but it didn't succeed because around 1992  IBM decided to quit their own private network and to go forTCP/IP and was the switching point. \nEverything done for X/OPEN were suddently forgotten. For the mainframes, and certainly in Belgium computing was mainly mainframes, i'm talking about universities here, so when IBM decided to go for TCP/IP Univiversities did follow. \nBut the aceptation of TCP/IP was really slow. For example, Belgacom was not interested in running the Domain Name System so we did it here, for some time, starting in 1993 with Pierre Verbaten (https://www.dnsbelgium.be/en/history). Belgacom were focused on X25 (DCS - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X.25) so they missed it.\n\n**It was like the french Minitel?**\nWell, at that time we were really jealous about Minitel. Could you imagine that? Terminals?  At home ? You could work home with a computer ! You could send emails ! All in one, a pc computer with a modem ! \n\n**How did the research about software evolved in the department?**\nI am mainly talking about network research but here. Tthere were people working on numerical analysis, computing, artificial intelligence ... I was just not involved in those research so i don't know much about it \n\n**You were focused on software and network..**\nYes, we did produce some software. We did make software to generate compilers, there was some A.I. software in Prolog, numerical analysis  libraries... Some were sold or shared, it depends.  \nWe did sell some software since the beginning i think when it was not even a department but a professor and a couple of students.\n\n**Is it when you joined?** \nNo it was already a department. I did study first industrial engeneering in electronics. At the time in electronics you did hear something about computers, i was interested in it i wanted to know more. I heard Kuleuvenhad started a year before a degree in computer engeneering. It was the first year where industrial engineers could join. The only thing we knew about computer were from movies. I wanted to know how it work. I'm not sure if I know now it now, but I have some ideas...\n\n**How many langage do you know?**\nAssembly, FORTRAN, PL-1 the langage invented by IBM to be the universal one, C, Cobol. Perl, i don't know, some  more. I'm not fluent in any computer langage, but i can read any langage especially well written, I knowIi can understand it and, if neede,  learn it...I know JAVA also. As a system administrator the thing I use most are the command line of UNIX and Perl. But that's because i'm more familiar with those two so it goes faster.\n\n**How did you see the rise of personnal computer and the software that goes with?**\nI have to admit that we missed it. We didn't see the new thing was powerful because available for everybody.  We were not impressed by the software. I remember windows 95, the news on TV, people sleeping on the street to get it. I remember when i get my first windows version, with a box of 22 floppies or so. Then i wanted to do something, to compile a program, but there was no compiler... We were used to Unix, a basic system but with a lot of utilities in it. Software was for us free, and we were used to have it free and on a pc it was not free anymore. \n\n**Does that mean you didn't had a personnal computer until late?**\nYes. I think it was round 2000. I didn't needed it really. I got one when the belgian UUCP network became commercial. Of course i did not get Windows on it.  I think we got Linux here in 1994. There was a guy involved in the kernel studying here. So we did used it very fast.\n\n**So, what is software for you?**\nFor me software is the magic that make computer usable. I can only gives examples of what i mean by it. A PC without software most people, even computer scientists, can't do anything with it. You need basic software. Some software is already integrated in the computer hardware. Same for phones, tablets... The main characteristic, for me, is that it should be user friendly. That is very difficult i know, because you have to imagine what the people using your software are going to do with it and how they want to use it, that's the magic you need to solve.\n\n*Is command line user friendly? \nWell, somehow you have to learn the Unix command langage; it is in fact a computer langage where you can make all the constructs that other langages offers.\nYou can create loops, you can test, whatever. It's not so different from computer langages like C or JAVA or whatever.  It is certainly programmer friendly.\n\nBut it's already software no ? User friendly depends on what you put behind these words, no ? \nYes it's already software. I don't have a strong opinion about command lines. It depends on people. I can imagine that someone that have never heard about the command line expect that you click somewhere and it happens. But if you know the command langage it's sometimes perhaps easier or productive to type commands and let it run. Sometimes, i find it easier if i have a screen and a number of buttons and i don't have to imagine what happens behind that screen. And sometimes i want to do something with the command line, because i'm used to it. That's why i don't trust myself about user friendliness because i have a long experience in computer interfaces. I'm so used to some of them perhaps i can't even imagine that somebody else would like to do it otherwise or doesn't like what i'm used to.\n\nApart from maintaining the museum, what do you work on ? You are still active in the department even though you are retired ? \nI work on sensors, in the internet of things world in one of the university spin-off. What i do for them is: wireless sensors need power, most  of them are on batteries. They have designed a complete system which should make the battery lasts for two, three, four years. They need a system to measure that. So I have been working on a mechanism to measure that without waiting four years. That's programming instrumentation computers to measure e.g. power or whatever. Most of it on  Unix systems. \nThere are enough new or unknown things and maybe because i'm older, i have another way of looking at things, so we have a lot of discussions. They don't like my Perl, they use python, JAVA and hose things... Perl, it has it's disavantage, but you can do a lot of things. Every  character has a meaning, that makes perl programs often unreadable.\nWith Python, you need all those libraries...It's easy when you know the libraries, waht  you have to call. When you know the arguments of the librairies...so it's also complicated. ANd if the library changes for some reasons, there you go.\n In my humble opinion it's the same with all the langages. It starts easy from scratch but if you have to interface them with existing things from the internet world or whatever it gets complicated.\n\nDo you have a last word ? \nI was surprised by your group reaction to the visit. I thought all of this was known. Maybe i'm getting old :) Curently i don't do much about the museum department, but sometimes i like to talk about the little stories about it. I remember a lot of little stories, a lot of technics who have been used and forgotten and some kept alive. I thought when i was young that the best techniques would succeed. That you would have visionnary people who would see the way.

HEADER: Interview with Jean Huens\n\n[short intro, when where ... interview with Jan Heuns, xxxx Peggy ... ]\n\n**You have been using computers since a long time, as you explained us during the tour we had the joy of attending during the TGSO.\nI heard that that until recently, let's say the late 1990's, when learning computer programming you had to start by  writing down the program on paper...** \n\nIn 1973, I did study computer sciences, it was the second year of the Computer Sciense course, here in Leuven. At the time computers were mainframes and you did feed them with programms by punch cards. Programming was writing down the program, then you punched it and the next day you get results, mostly error. That's the way it worked at that time. To teach us programming, they used the langage of that time, Fortran and some kind of invented assembly langage, it didn't really exist, it was simplified.\n\nMost of the time you did write down your program, the teacher and the assistant would have to tell you what is wrong or good, you didn't had much practical experience.\n\n**What was it like, tons of pages?** \n\nNo. As an anecdocte, i remember punchcards were a block of papers, we were jealous of the people who came into the computer center with huge stacks of cards. They were really small programs, not complicated one. In fact you had to learn to use the computer from scratch, everything was new, you couldn't rely on previous experiences, everything was new. And to start with small programs was difficult enough. \n\nThat was also the time when Edsger W. Dijkstra, who fought against the goto and other common but bad constructs [@tdijksra:1972:goto]. I still remember him, in an audience, giving us a lecture on good  techniques in programming at the International computing symposium 1977 in Liège [@dijksra:1977:craft]. It was a rather hard course because Dijkstra expected you to quickly  understand and implement his ideas.\n\nAnd then from '75 on, computers became cheaper and could be bought by departments and smaller entities. And than came the first interactive computer. Still beasts about two cubic meters, costing two millions belgian francs. But it was low enough to allow people to type in directly commands. I started working here in '75 as a researcher, it has evolved continuously and I saw computers getting cheaper and getting easier to use.The way to use it was simplified, you could start to go to the beast and try it out.\n\nI remember more or less: you wrote down the program in Fortran for instance. We always thought in the beginning that it would work and it didn't, so after a turn around you were giving it back to the operator and you have to wait another half a day or a night to get the results.\n\n**What kind of program you were working on?** \n\nI remember the first program i had to write was: you got three numbers, you had to make the program decide if you could construct a triangle with the numbers being the sides of the triangle.\n\n**That took an afternoon to be processed?** \n\nWell, yeah. You had to imagine how to do it which was also one problem, than you prepare the cards with the punching machine and you give the package of cards to the operator who was feeeding the computer with the cards. Operator people had the taks to feed the computers by hands, with paper, cards, then cards got written on disks and later processed by the mainframe from disk. Finally results got printed on paper. it lasts onto the magnetic disks period. And after a number of hours or a night you got a listing, a piece of paper, with the results or program compilation errors.\n\n**When where you able to record the program onto the machine?**\n\nI think that happened between '75 and '80. After the punching cards, which were already a way to record the program, we had typewriters and then terminals. We could record the programs by typing it on the terminal  and the computer would store them on disk. We had magnetic discs. IBM had number for everything, i remember the 3300  [manufactured from 1970 on] was a magnetic disk. \nWe didn't touch the machines, operators would change the disks, we could only access the typewriter/terminal. That was our most direct connexion to the computer. The times were diffent. The mainframes were such huge costly beasts that it had operators day and night to keep it busy. Even at night there were two or three guys mounting tapes, dismounting tapes, that kind of stuff.\nhttps://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/42/IBM_magnetic_disk_drives_3330%2B3333.png/600px-IBM_magnetic_disk_drives_3330%2B3333.png\n\n**When did you stop working with operators?** \n\nSomewhere between '85 and '90. There were still operators at the main computer of the university, but there were also small computers, so researchers and student could have direct access when needed. \n\n**When did you start to work with software sold by others or given away in order to do your research?** \n\nYou still need an operating system on the mainframe that was delivered by IBM or the constructor delivering the mainframe. When you bought mini-computers, which were the  smaller versions of mainframes, in most cases you did buy an operating systems, compilers and all the stuff you did need to be able to program or work  those things. \nIn most cases,  the computer sciences department did buy the mini-computer from, for instance *Digital Equipment Corporation*,  a manufactorer at that time, but they didn't buy DEC's  software. The DEC software  was not open source or free,  and as a university we could get Unix for free and could run it on those digital equipment  DEC computers. That is what the computer department of the University of Louvain la Neuve *l'unité d'informatique*, did and so did we.\n\n**When did you start working with unix as an os?** \n\nI took a trip to Amsterdam, it must have been in 1979/80… Well, the story starts in our french sister university (LLN) where they did have a PDP-11 with Unix on it. You could get Unix, at the time, when you were a university, from Bell Labs (part of AT&T), the american telephone company. AT&T was a mega organisation at the time [before the [dismantlment of AT&T/Bell system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breakup_of_the_Bell_System)]. Due to monopoly, the US authorities did split it up in different Baby Bells. One of the restriction was that the research baby bell, could not sell anything. There were computer scientists there, who did develop some interesting things (e.g. Unix). For universities you did get the source for free, but NO  support, nothing not even how to install it. In Unité d'informatique, where they had a [PDP-11/70](https://i0.wp.com/www.utterpower.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/pdp11-70-panel.jpg) they were lucky: they got the same computer that unix was developped on.  They got the disk by snail mail as a post-office package. They mounted it and it did spin up and they had UNIX.\nHere, we did have a cheaper PDP11, [the PDP 11/60](https://dave.cheney.net/tag/pdp-11). We got the Unix disk distribution from Bell Labs but we could not run it, because we got another type of disk(RK07). We could look at it but that was all, because our disc format was different than the one at Bell Labs. Somebody here (P.Verbaeten) did write a driver for that disk in l'unité \nd'informatique of LLN. But they did not have a RK07.  it did compile it but we couldn't try it because we did not have. The nearest place  with Unix and RK07 was in Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam.  Andrew Tenenbaum, who did write a number of books on operating systems, was working there. He was learning to speak dutch. We did understood his english better but his assistant explained that he needed to practice speaking Dutch because he would have to pass an exam. There we compiled Unix with an RK07 driver and stored it on a bootable RK07 disk. With that disk back in Leuven we could start Unix on our PDP11/60. An error in the process meant a trip Leuven-Amsterdam and back.\nIn my opinion the start of open source was Unix because everybody  had to maintain it by ourselves and we learned a lot from the sources. \nIn that time for software distribution you did have to store it on magnetic tape and send the tape us to different places with associated problems. For example,  the agents at the customs at the airport or post didn't know what to do with the tapes or discs in terms of custom clearance. They used magnetic or xrays as inspection tools and we had to write on the package that it should not be x-rayed. And sometimes we still got unreadable tapes/discs. \n\n**So it took like weeks between the transportation, the custom...**\nYes, the custom had to clear the packages. I remember I've been in the customs in Zaventem. I had received a letter that my package from Bell Labs had arrived. I went there thinking I would have to pay something and go. But no. It had to be cleared so there wa some organisation that had to do administrative stuff, so I only got it a few days later. The response time was huge :)\n\n**Than after that period of time how did you switch from that kind of collaboration on how to make software and make software work to collaboration on networks, between universities and researchers...**\nIn the Unix systems at that time there was a kind of networking protocol which did work on serial lines (UUCP).\nTo connect two unix systems together you only need a serial line. We had a line between LLN and Leuven, it's only 25 kms, but we had to ask Belgacom, then La Régie des Télégraphes et Téléphones, to get a modem to connect through their network and than over that modem you could reach an amazing speed of 300 characters per second. And that was the first communication. It did happened somewhere around 85. And then you had connexion with another computer, writing something here and do the transfer to the other computer and execute it there. \n \n**What was the first thing you did send through a network like this?**\nI didn't do it myself, I remember it was a kind of chat program. On LLN side was Prof.Elie Milgrom, he is retired now. On this side, it was Prof.  Yves Willems. And I remember that they typed something and they got a response from the other side and that was it.  But I remember that Pr Willems sent \"ok we stop now\". And that Elie Milgrom answered \"See you later, Alligator\" [a reference to Bill Haley and the Comets].  At the time we still had these kind of songs in mind. (lol). \nThose Unix to Unix connexions were first. And there was a worldwide Unix to Unix based network, Usenet (1979), it still exists somewhere... you can download load  of illegal movies and that stuff, that was not what we meant at the time. But that is what is left. And Usenet became gradually replaced by the Internet in USA. \nIn Europe, the Internet came a lot later, but we had limited access to the Internet by mail and even FTP; We could send mail to the Internet and we could receive mail from them, because Some friendly american university, later companies, did translate internet mail to UCP mail., moreover they did translate specially formatted mails into FTP request and send the result back to us by mail. That was before the 1990's.\n \n**Your relation to software had changed at the time because you did not have to do all this manipulations with the software your received... Was it already floppy discs?**\nNo, magnetic tapes, for the mainframe at least. Even most of the mini-computers had some (cheaper) magnetic tapes. Between 90 and 95 the main machines used for  Unix software development was a VAX from DEC. Once a year the software came from Berkeley, it was still Unix but modified by Berkeley for virtual memory and all the stuff which are common now. We received a tape, with lot of goodies, I still remember we didn't know what was on the tape  but we did scrutinise it  to know what was on there, what we can use....\nIn Europe, companies like Siemens were trying to set up software centers to make software avaiable, they were even trying to set up European networks. But researchers did love the Internet, it worked, it was useful for their researchs. So companies in Europe, were trying to set up their own networks, I remember for example the X/OPEN transport protocol. Their was a lot of standards about what software layers should do, but it didn't succeed because around 1992 IBM decided to quit their own private network and to go forTCP/IP and was the switching point. \nEverything done for X/OPEN were suddently forgotten. For the mainframes, and certainly in Belgium computing was mainly mainframes, I'm talking about universities here, so when IBM decided to go for TCP/IP Univiversities did follow. \nBut the aceptation of TCP/IP was really slow. For example, Belgacom was not interested in running the Domain Name System so we did it here, for some time, starting in 1993 with Pierre Verbaten (https://www.dnsbelgium.be/en/history). Belgacom were focused on X25 (DCS - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X.25) so they missed it.\n\n**It was like the french Minitel?**\nWell, at that time we were really jealous about Minitel. Could you imagine that? Terminals?  At home? You could work home with a computer! You could send emails! All in one, a pc computer with a modem! \n\n**How did the research about software evolved in the department?**\nI am mainly talking about network research but here. There were people working on numerical analysis, computing, artificial intelligence ... I was just not involved in those research so I don't know much about it \n\n**You were focused on software and network..**\nYes, we did produce some software. We did make software to generate compilers, there was some A.I. software in Prolog, numerical analysis  libraries... Some were sold or shared, it depends.  \nWe did sell some software since the beginning I think when it was not even a department but a professor and a couple of students.\n\n**Is it when you joined?** \nNo it was already a department. I did study first industrial engeneering in electronics. At the time in electronics you did hear something about computers, I was interested in it. I wanted to know more. I heard Kuleuvenhad started a\n% year before a\ndegree in computer engeneering. It was the first year where industrial engineers could join. The only thing we knew about computer were from movies. I wanted to know how it work. I'm not sure if I know now it now, but I have some ideas...\n\n**How many langage do you know?**\nAssembly, FORTRAN, PL-1 the langage invented by IBM to be the universal one, C, Cobol. Perl, I don't know, some  more. I'm not fluent in any computer langage, but I can read any language especially well written, I know I can understand it and, if needed,  learn it... I know JAVA also. As a system administrator the thing I use most are the command line of UNIX and Perl. But that's because i'm more familiar with those two so it goes faster.\n\n**How did you see the rise of personnal computer and the software that goes with?**\nI have to admit that we missed it. We didn't see the new thing was powerful because available for everybody.  We were not impressed by the software. I remember windows 95, the news on TV, people sleeping on the street to get it. I remember when I get my first windows version, with a box of 22 floppies or so. Then I wanted to do something, to compile a program, but there was no compiler... We were used to Unix, a basic system but with a lot of utilities in it. Software was for us free, and we were used to have it free and on a pc it was not free anymore. \n\n**Does that mean you didn't had a personnal computer until late?**\nYes. I think it was round 2000. I didn't needed it really. I got one when the belgian UUCP network became commercial. Of course I did not get Windows on it.  I think we got Linux here in 1994. There was a guy involved in the kernel studying here. So we did used it very fast.\n\n**So, what is software for you?**\nFor me software is the magic that make computer usable. I can only gives examples of what i mean by it. A PC without software most people, even computer scientists, can't do anything with it. You need basic software. Some software is already integrated in the computer hardware. Same for phones, tablets... The main characteristic, for me, is that it should be user friendly. That is very difficult I know, because you have to imagine what the people using your software are going to do with it and how they want to use it, that's the magic you need to solve.\n\n**Is command line user friendly?**\nWell, somehow you have to learn the Unix command langage; it is in fact a computer language where you can make all the constructs that other langages offers.\nYou can create loops, you can test, whatever. It's not so different from computer languages like C or JAVA or whatever. It is certainly programmer friendly.\n\n**But it's already software, no? User friendly depends on what you put behind these words, no?**\nYes it's already software. I don't have a strong opinion about command lines. It depends on people. I can imagine that someone that has never heard about the command line expect that you click somewhere and it happens. But if you know the command langage it's sometimes perhaps easier or productive to type commands and let it run. Sometimes, i find it easier if i have a screen and a number of buttons and i don't have to imagine what happens behind that screen. And sometimes i want to do something with the command line, because i'm used to it. That's why i don't trust myself about user friendliness because i have a long experience in computer interfaces. I'm so used to some of them perhaps i can't even imagine that somebody else would like to do it otherwise or doesn't like what i'm used to.\n\n**Apart from maintaining the museum, what do you work on ? You are still active in the department even though you are retired?**\nI work on sensors, in the internet of things world in one of the university spin-off. What i do for them is: wireless sensors need power, most  of them are on batteries. They have designed a complete system which should make the battery lasts for two, three, four years. They need a system to measure that. So I have been working on a mechanism to measure that without waiting four years. That's programming instrumentation computers to measure e.g. power or whatever. Most of it on  Unix systems. \nThere are enough new or unknown things and maybe because i'm older, i have another way of looking at things, so we have a lot of discussions. They don't like my Perl, they use python, JAVA and hose things... Perl, it has it's disavantage, but you can do a lot of things. Every  character has a meaning, that makes perl programs often unreadable.\nWith Python, you need all those libraries...It's easy when you know the libraries, waht  you have to call. When you know the arguments of the librairies...so it's also complicated. ANd if the library changes for some reasons, there you go.\n In my humble opinion it's the same with all the langages. It starts easy from scratch but if you have to interface them with existing things from the internet world or whatever it gets complicated.\n\n**Do you have a last word?** \nI was surprised by your group reaction to the visit. I thought all of this was known. Maybe i'm getting old :) Curently i don't do much about the museum department, but sometimes i like to talk about the little stories about it. I remember a lot of little stories, a lot of technics who have been used and forgotten and some kept alive. I thought when i was young that the best techniques would succeed. That you would have visionnary people who would see the way. But i realized that a lot of things do happen by accident.\n\n\n\n\n\n","attribs":"*7+a*7*3+p*7|1+1*g|2+21*6|1+1*5+2y*f*5+8*5+h*6|1+1*5+4c*6|2+2+9*f+1+1o*d+n+1y*f+1+19*f+1+10*d+1+3e*f+1+3s*6|2+2+4n*6|1+1|1+1*5+2*f*5+4*5+v*6|2+2+1s*e+1+17*f+2+1e*f+2+1e*d+2+3a*e+k+1l*6|2+2+1h*f+5+1h*0+m+45*0+m+2z*6|2+2+e*f+1+8f*f+1+p*d+1+q*f+1+d*d+1+3j*6|2+2+t*f+6+14*f+2+49*d+8+15*6|2+2*5+1a*6|2+2+1b*d+1+1u*d+6+1y*6|2+2*5+18*6|2+2+2p*d+1+3f*d+a+o*d+1+1b*d+1+2*d+l+9*d+2a+1*e+14+19*d+1+1b*d+u+1*6|2+2*5+1r*6|2+2+c*d+1+6*f+2+9*f+1+7*f+1+s*d+1+8*f+3+1k*d+a+9*d+1+1*d+1+r*d+u+1*d+n+e*d*e+4*e+8+1t*d+1+2*d+1+s*d+4+h*d|1+1+2r*d+9+1l*0+1+2s*d+3+33*6|1+1+41*6|2+2*5+1a*6|2+2+i*f+1+7*f+1+3s*d+4+x*6|2+2*5+1t*f*5+1*5+12*6|2+2+8*f+1+7m*d+4+q*d+9+f*d|1+1+f*d+1+27*d+1+7*d+1+9*d+1+t*d+2+w*d+6+e*d+e+2*d+2+r*d+m+g*d+9+q*e+i*d+1+3q*6|2+2*5+1f*6|2+2+43*0+1+f*0+2+4*d+a+1g*d+n+z*d+2*h+1*d+1+3z*d+1+10*d+4+5*d+3+1n*d+6+p*d+4+f*d+1+1l*d+1+j*d+c+16*d+h+8*d+11+p*0+i*h+1*0+9*h+2*0+2a*h+1+1k*d+2+3f*d+4+1*6|1+1+x*0+1*h+2*0+d*h+1*0+11+1*0*2+1*0+37+2q*0+4+2*0|1+21*0+1f+1v*0+1+1*h+2*0+2d*h+1*0+d1*d|1+1*d+1+1j*d+a+1z*0+1*d|1+1+d*d+t+7*d+2+4*d+5+1*d+2+1*d+l+1*d+c+n*d+p+14*d+1+1k*d+9+1r*d+p+1q*h+1*d+p+c*d+6+7*0|2+2*5+1v*0|1+1+1i*h+1+2f*0+4+10*h+1+3s*h+1+1o*0|2+2*5+5m*0|1+1+i*d+1+1*d+2+29*d+7+1*0|1+1*d+2+1f*d+7+d*d+6+z*d+1+11*d+1+1*2+e*d*2+1*2+e*d*2+1*2+b+83*d+1j+2*0|1+1+1*0|1+1*5+1y*0|1+1+n*h+1+15*d+1+f*d+5+1k*d+3+1*d+6+d*h+1+2u*h+1+5x*d|1+1+90*d|1+1+1h*d+8+m*d+o+m*d+b+10*e+9+1*d+1+2j*d+35+r*0|1+1+1*0|1+1*5+4r*0|1+1+1c*d+6+z*d+1+6*d+2+1h*d+5+5*d+5+9*d+c+5s*h+1+1a*d+6+8*d+4+b*d+3+i*d+3+n*d+3*0|1+1+3o*d+9+a*d+5+42*h+1+46*d+b+2o*d|1+1+3n*h+1+21*d+i+7*d+1+1*d|1+1*d+1a+7p*0|2+2*h*5+2*5+v*h*5+2*0|1+1+5m*0|2+2*h*5+2*5+1q*h*5+2*0|1+1+1f*d+3+3o*h+1+q*0|2+2*h*5+2*5+16*h*5+2*0|1+1+5b*0|1+1+1a*h+1+2a*0|2+2*h*5+2*5+m*h*5+2*5+1*0|1+1+18*d+5+2z*h+1+l*h+1+1*h+1+u*d+8+d*h|1+1*h*e+2*e+d*h|1+1+27*d+1+1k*d+4+1h*d+4+9*d+e+i*0|2+2*h*5+2*5+t*h*5+2*0|1+1+2l*h+1+f*d+3+t*d+8+e*h+1+i*h+1+t*d+2+4*h+1*d+1+m*d+a*h+1*d+2+c*h+1+1h*d+2+3b*0|2+2*h*5+2*5+27*h*5+2*0|1+1+1f*d+2+4*d+6+c*d+y+3s*h+1+1x*h+1+21*d+2+3s*d+8+p*0|2+2*h*5+2*5+1q*h*5+2*0|1+1+2f*d+1+14*h+1+42*0|2+2*h*5+2*5+t*h*5+2*0|1+1+6f*d+3+4l*h+1+4f*0|2+2*h*5+2*5+u*h*5+2*0|1+1+10*d+5+f*d+4+r*h+1+1x*0|1+1+2e*h+1+w*d+11*0|2+2*h*5+2*5+p*h*5+1*5+1u*h*5+2*0|1+1+3q*h+1+ih*0|2+2*h*5+2*5+3g*h*5+2*0|1+1+2z*d+1+a*d+8+c*d+5+4n*d+6+3f*d+1+5*d+5+h*d+1+1*d+e+f*d|1+1+59*d+4+e*d+1+14*d+2+i*d+9+o*d|1+19+29*d+7+3a*d+1+w*d|1+1+3w*d+1+1l*0|2+2*h*5+2*5+o*h*5+2*5+1*0|1+1+24*d+2+bp*d+4+k*0|1+1*6|3+3*0|1+1|1+1"}}},"pad:observatory.guide.jeanhuensitvextended:revs:9401":{"changeset":"Z:f6t>1|2u=d1q=4x*h+1$s","meta":{"author":"a.eJQfyC3773rYpTah","timestamp":1518874574735}},"pad:observatory.guide.jeanhuensitvextended:revs:9402":{"changeset":"Z:f6u>0|2u=d1q=9k-1*h+1$I","meta":{"author":"a.eJQfyC3773rYpTah","timestamp":1518874584775}},"pad:observatory.guide.jeanhuensitvextended:revs:9403":{"changeset":"Z:f6u>0|2u=d1q=bc-1*h+1$I","meta":{"author":"a.eJQfyC3773rYpTah","timestamp":1518874590496}},"pad:observatory.guide.jeanhuensitvextended:revs:9404":{"changeset":"Z:f6u>0|2u=d1q=db-1*h+1$I","meta":{"author":"a.eJQfyC3773rYpTah","timestamp":1518874597290}},"pad:observatory.guide.jeanhuensitvextended:revs:9405":{"changeset":"Z:f6u>0|2u=d1q=et-1*h+1$I","meta":{"author":"a.eJQfyC3773rYpTah","timestamp":1518874601703}},"pad:observatory.guide.jeanhuensitvextended:revs:9406":{"changeset":"Z:f6u>0|2u=d1q=fk-1*h+1$I","meta":{"author":"a.eJQfyC3773rYpTah","timestamp":1518874606215}},"pad:observatory.guide.jeanhuensitvextended:revs:9407":{"changeset":"Z:f6u>0|2u=d1q=h1-1*h+1$I","meta":{"author":"a.eJQfyC3773rYpTah","timestamp":1518874613097}},"pad:observatory.guide.jeanhuensitvextended:revs:9408":{"changeset":"Z:f6u>0|2u=d1q=je-1*h+1$I","meta":{"author":"a.eJQfyC3773rYpTah","timestamp":1518874618993}},"pad:observatory.guide.jeanhuensitvextended:revs:9409":{"changeset":"Z:f6u>0|2u=d1q=lx-1*h+1$I","meta":{"author":"a.eJQfyC3773rYpTah","timestamp":1518874626827}},"pad:observatory.guide.jeanhuensitvextended:revs:941":{"changeset":"Z:5or>2|18=505=d3*0*2+2$wa","meta":{"author":"a.kqv62Q3nhchdwIuK","timestamp":1518090093149}},"pad:observatory.guide.jeanhuensitvextended:revs:9410":{"changeset":"Z:f6u<1|2w=do1=1k-1$","meta":{"author":"a.eJQfyC3773rYpTah","timestamp":1518874634288}},"pad:observatory.guide.jeanhuensitvextended:revs:9411":{"changeset":"Z:f6t>0|2x=drl=2j-1*h+1$I","meta":{"author":"a.eJQfyC3773rYpTah","timestamp":1518874653124}},"pad:observatory.guide.jeanhuensitvextended:revs:9412":{"changeset":"Z:f6t<1|2x=drl=6p-1$","meta":{"author":"a.eJQfyC3773rYpTah","timestamp":1518874668817}},"pad:observatory.guide.jeanhuensitvextended:revs:9413":{"changeset":"Z:f6s<1|2x=drl=de-1$","meta":{"author":"a.eJQfyC3773rYpTah","timestamp":1518874685904}},"pad:observatory.guide.jeanhuensitvextended:revs:9414":{"changeset":"Z:f6r>0|2y=e5e=1l-1*h+1$I","meta":{"author":"a.eJQfyC3773rYpTah","timestamp":1518874693838}},"pad:observatory.guide.jeanhuensitvextended:revs:9415":{"changeset":"Z:f6r>1|2y=e5e=5d*h+1$t","meta":{"author":"a.eJQfyC3773rYpTah","tim

PP: You have been using computers since a long time, as you explained us during the tour we had the joy of attending during the TGSO.\nI heard that that until recently, let's say the late 1990's, when learning computer programming you had to start by  writing down the program on paper... \n\n% JH: In 1973, I did study computer sciences, it was the second year of the Computer Sciense course, here in Leuven. At the time computers were mainframes and you did feed them with programms by punch cards. Programming was writing down the program, then you punched it and the next day you get results, mostly error. That's the way it worked at that time. To teach us programming, they used the langage of that time, Fortran and some kind of invented assembly langage, it didn't really exist, it was simplified.\n\nMost of the time you did write down your program, the teacher and the assistant would have to tell you what is wrong or good, you didn't had much practical experience.\n\n% PP: What was it like, tons of pages? \n\n% JH: No. As an anecdocte, I remember punchcards were a block of papers, we were jealous of the people who came into the computer center with huge stacks of cards. They were really small programs, not complicated one. In fact you had to learn to use the computer from scratch, everything was new, you couldn't rely on previous experiences.\n% , everything was new.\nAnd to start with small programs was difficult enough. \n\nThat was also the time when Edsger W. Dijkstra, who fought against the goto and other common but bad constructs [@tdijksra:1972:goto]. I still remember him, in an audience, giving us a lecture on good  techniques in programming at the International computing symposium 1977 in Liège [@dijksra:1977:craft]. It was a rather hard course because Dijkstra expected you to quickly  understand and implement his ideas.\n\nAnd then from '75 on, computers became cheaper and could be bought by departments and smaller entities. And than came the first interactive computer. Still beasts about two cubic meters, costing two millions belgian francs. But it was low enough to allow people to type in directly commands. I started working here in '75 as a researcher, it has evolved continuously and I saw computers getting cheaper and getting easier to use.The way to use it was simplified, you could start to go to the beast and try it out.\n\nI remember more or less: you wrote down the program in Fortran for instance. We always thought in the beginning that it would work and it didn't, so after a turn around you were giving it back to the operator and you have to wait another half a day or a night to get the results.\n\n% PP: What kind of program you were working on? \n\n% JH: I remember the first program I had to write was: you got three numbers, you had to make the program decide if you could construct a triangle with the numbers being the sides of the triangle.\n\n% That took an afternoon to be processed?\n\nWell, yeah. You had to imagine how to do it which was also one problem, than you prepare the cards with the punching machine and you give the package of cards to the operator who was feeeding the computer with the cards. Operator people had the taks to feed the computers by hands, with paper, cards, then cards got written on disks and later processed by the mainframe from disk. Finally results got printed on paper. it lasts onto the magnetic disks period. And after a number of hours or a night you got a listing, a piece of paper, with the results or program compilation errors.\n\n**When where you able to record the program onto the machine?**\n\nI think that happened between '75 and '80. After the punching cards, which were already a way to record the program, we had typewriters and then terminals. We could record the programs by typing it on the terminal  and the computer would store them on disk. We had magnetic discs. IBM had number for everything, I remember the 3300  [manufactured from 1970 on] was a magnetic disk. \nWe didn't touch the machines, operators would change the disks, we could only access the typewriter/terminal. That was our most direct connexion to the computer. The times were diffent. The mainframes were such huge costly beasts that it had operators day and night to keep it busy. Even at night there were two or three guys mounting tapes, dismounting tapes, that kind of stuff.\nhttps://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/42/IBM_magnetic_disk_drives_3330%2B3333.png/600px-IBM_magnetic_disk_drives_3330%2B3333.png\n\n**When did you stop working with operators?** \n\nSomewhere between '85 and '90. There were still operators at the main computer of the university, but there were also small computers, so researchers and student could have direct access when needed. \n\n**When did you start to work with software sold by others or given away in order to do your research?** \n\nYou still need an operating system on the mainframe that was delivered by IBM or the constructor delivering the mainframe. When you bought mini-computers, which were the  smaller versions of mainframes, in most cases you did buy an operating systems, compilers and all the stuff you did need to be able to program or work  those things. \nIn most cases,  the computer sciences department did buy the mini-computer from, for instance *Digital Equipment Corporation*,  a manufactorer at that time, but they didn't buy DEC's  software. The DEC software  was not open source or free,  and as a university we could get Unix for free and could run it on those digital equipment  DEC computers. That is what the computer department of the University of Louvain la Neuve *l'unité d'informatique*, did and so did we.\n\n**When did you start working with unix as an os?** \n\nI took a trip to Amsterdam, it must have been in 1979/80… Well, the story starts in our french sister university (LLN) where they did have a PDP-11 with Unix on it. You could get Unix, at the time, when you were a university, from Bell Labs (part of AT&T), the american telephone company. AT&T was a mega organisation at the time [before the [dismantlment of AT&T/Bell system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breakup_of_the_Bell_System)]. Due to monopoly, the US authorities did split it up in different Baby Bells. One of the restriction was that the research baby bell, could not sell anything. There were computer scientists there, who did develop some interesting things (e.g. Unix). For universities you did get the source for free, but NO  support, nothing not even how to install it. In Unité d'informatique, where they had a [PDP-11/70](https://i0.wp.com/www.utterpower.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/pdp11-70-panel.jpg) they were lucky: they got the same computer that unix was developped on.  They got the disk by snail mail as a post-office package. They mounted it and it did spin up and they had UNIX.\nHere, we did have a cheaper PDP11, [the PDP 11/60](https://dave.cheney.net/tag/pdp-11). We got the Unix disk distribution from Bell Labs but we could not run it, because we got another type of disk(RK07). We could look at it but that was all, because our disc format was different than the one at Bell Labs. Somebody here (P.Verbaeten) did write a driver for that disk in l'unité \nd'informatique of LLN. But they did not have a RK07.  it did compile it but we couldn't try it because we did not have. The nearest place  with Unix and RK07 was in Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam.  Andrew Tenenbaum, who did write a number of books on operating systems, was working there. He was learning to speak dutch. We did understood his english better but his assistant explained that he needed to practice speaking Dutch because he would have to pass an exam. There we compiled Unix with an RK07 driver and stored it on a bootable RK07 disk. With that disk back in Leuven we could start Unix on our PDP11/60. An error in the process meant a trip Leuven-Amsterdam and back.\nIn my opinion the start of open source was Unix because everybody  had to maintain it by ourselves and we learned a lot from the sources. \nIn that time for software distribution you did have to store it on magnetic tape and send the tape us to different places with associated problems. For example,  the agents at the customs at the airport or post didn't know what to do with the tapes or discs in terms of custom clearance. They used magnetic or xrays as inspection tools and we had to write on the package that it should not be x-rayed. And sometimes we still got unreadable tapes/discs. \n\n**So it took like weeks between the transportation, the custom...**\n\nYes, the custom had to clear the packages. I remember I've been in the customs in Zaventem. I had received a letter that my package from Bell Labs had arrived. I went there thinking I would have to pay something and go. But no. It had to be cleared so there wa some organisation that had to do administrative stuff, so I only got it a few days later. The response time was huge :)\n\n**Than after that period of time how did you switch from that kind of collaboration on how to make software and make software work to collaboration on networks, between universities and researchers...**\n\nIn the Unix systems at that time there was a kind of networking protocol which did work on serial lines (UUCP).\nTo connect two unix systems together you only need a serial line. We had a line between LLN and Leuven, it's only 25 kms, but we had to ask Belgacom, then La Régie des Télégraphes et Téléphones, to get a modem to connect through their network and than over that modem you could reach an amazing speed of 300 characters per second. And that was the first communication. It did happened somewhere around 85. And then you had connexion with another computer, writing something here and do the transfer to the other computer and execute it there. \n \n**What was the first thing you did send through a network like this?**\n\nI didn't do it myself, I remember it was a kind of chat program. On LLN side was Prof.Elie Milgrom, he is retired now. On this side, it was Prof.  Yves Willems. And I remember that they typed something and they got a response from the other side and that was it.  But I remember that Pr Willems sent \"ok we stop now\". And that Elie Milgrom answered \"See you later, Alligator\" [a reference to Bill Haley and the Comets].  At the time we still had these kind of songs in mind. (lol). \nThose Unix to Unix connexions were first. And there was a worldwide Unix to Unix based network, Usenet (1979), it still exists somewhere... you can download load  of illegal movies and that stuff, that was not what we meant at the time. But that is what is left. And Usenet became gradually replaced by the Internet in USA. \nIn Europe, the Internet came a lot later, but we had limited access to the Internet by mail and even FTP; We could send mail to the Internet and we could receive mail from them, because Some friendly american university, later companies, did translate internet mail to UCP mail., moreover they did translate specially formatted mails into FTP request and send the result back to us by mail. That was before the 1990's.\n \n**Your relation to software had changed at the time because you did not have to do all this manipulations with the software your received... Was it already floppy discs?**\n\nNo, magnetic tapes, for the mainframe at least. Even most of the mini-computers had some (cheaper) magnetic tapes. Between 90 and 95 the main machines used for  Unix software development was a VAX from DEC. Once a year the software came from Berkeley, it was still Unix but modified by Berkeley for virtual memory and all the stuff which are common now. We received a tape, with lot of goodies, I still remember we didn't know what was on the tape  but we did scrutinise it  to know what was on there, what we can use....\nIn Europe, companies like Siemens were trying to set up software centers to make software avaiable, they were even trying to set up European networks. But researchers did love the Internet, it worked, it was useful for their researchs. So companies in Europe, were trying to set up their own networks, I remember for example the X/OPEN transport protocol. Their was a lot of standards about what software layers should do, but it didn't succeed because around 1992 IBM decided to quit their own private network and to go forTCP/IP and was the switching point. \nEverything done for X/OPEN were suddently forgotten. For the mainframes, and certainly in Belgium computing was mainly mainframes, I'm talking about universities here, so when IBM decided to go for TCP/IP Univiversities did follow. \nBut the aceptation of TCP/IP was really slow. For example, Belgacom was not interested in running the Domain Name System so we did it here, for some time, starting in 1993 with Pierre Verbaten (https://www.dnsbelgium.be/en/history). Belgacom were focused on X25 (DCS - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X.25) so they missed it.\n\n**It was like the french Minitel?**\n\nWell, at that time we were really jealous about Minitel. Could you imagine that? Terminals?  At home? You could work home with a computer! You could send emails! All in one, a pc computer with a modem! \n\n**How did the research about software evolved in the department?**\n\nI am mainly talking about network research but here. There were people working on numerical analysis, computing, artificial intelligence ... I was just not involved in those research so I don't know much about it \n\n**You were focused on software and network..**\n\nYes, we did produce some software. We did make software to generate compilers, there was some A.I. software in Prolog, numerical analysis  libraries... Some were sold or shared, it depends.  \nWe did sell some software since the beginning I think when it was not even a department but a professor and a couple of students.\n\n**Is it when you joined?**\n\nNo it was already a department. I did study first industrial engeneering in electronics. At the time in electronics you did hear something about computers, I was interested in it. I wanted to know more. I heard Kuleuvenhad started a\n% year before a\ndegree in computer engeneering. It was the first year where industrial engineers could join. The only thing we knew about computer were from movies. I wanted to know how it work. I'm not sure if I know now it now, but I have some ideas...\n\n**How many langage do you know?**\n\nAssembly, FORTRAN, PL-1 the langage invented by IBM to be the universal one, C, Cobol. Perl, I don't know, some  more. I'm not fluent in any computer langage, but I can read any language especially well written, I know I can understand it and, if needed,  learn it... I know JAVA also. As a system administrator the thing I use most are the command line of UNIX and Perl. But that's because i'm more familiar with those two so it goes faster.\n\n**How did you see the rise of personnal computer and the software that goes with?**\n\nI have to admit that we missed it. We didn't see the new thing was powerful because available for everybody.  We were not impressed by the software. I remember windows 95, the news on TV, people sleeping on the street to get it. I remember when I get my first windows version, with a box of 22 floppies or so. Then I wanted to do something, to compile a program, but there was no compiler... We were used to Unix, a basic system but with a lot of utilities in it. Software was for us free, and we were used to have it free and on a pc it was not free anymore. \n\n**Does that mean you didn't had a personnal computer until late?**\n\nYes. I think it was round 2000. I didn't needed it really. I got one when the belgian UUCP network became commercial. Of course I did not get Windows on it.  I think we got Linux here in 1994. There was a guy involved in the kernel studying here. So we did used it very fast.\n\n**So, what is software for you?**\n\nFor me software is the magic that make computer usable. I can only gives examples of what I mean by it. A PC without software most people, even computer scientists, can't do anything with it. You need basic software. Some software is already integrated in the computer hardware. Same for phones, tablets... The main characteristic, for me, is that it should be user friendly. That is very difficult I know, because you have to imagine what the people using your software are going to do with it and how they want to use it, that's the magic you need to solve.\n\n**Is command line user friendly?**\n\nWell, somehow you have to learn the Unix command langage; it is in fact a computer language where you can make all the constructs that other langages offers.\nYou can create loops, you can test, whatever. It's not so different from computer languages like C or JAVA or whatever. It is certainly programmer friendly.\n\n**But it's already software, no? User friendly depends on what you put behind these words, no?**\n\nYes it's already software. I don't have a strong opinion about command lines. It depends on people. I can imagine that someone that has never heard about the command line expects that you click somewhere and it happens. But if you know the command langage it's sometimes perhaps easier or productive to type commands and let it run. Sometimes, I find it easier if I have a screen and a number of buttons and I don't have to imagine what happens behind that screen. And sometimes I want to do something with the command line, because I'm used to it. That's why I don't trust myself about user friendliness because I have a long experience in computer interfaces. I'm so used to some of them perhaps I can't even imagine that somebody else would like to do it otherwise or doesn't like what I'm used to.\n\n**Apart from maintaining the museum, what do you work on? You are still active in the department even though you are retired?**\n\nI work on sensors, in the internet of things world in one of the university spin-off. What I do for them is: wireless sensors need power, most  of them are on batteries. They have designed a complete system which should make the battery last for two, three, four years. They need a system to measure that. So I have been working on a mechanism to measure that without waiting four years. That's programming instrumentation computers to measure e.g. power or whatever. Most of it on Unix systems. \nThere are enough new or unknown things and maybe because I'm older, I have another way of looking at things, so we have a lot of discussions. They don't like my Perl, they use python, JAVA and those things... Perl, it has its disadvantage, but you can do a lot of things. Every  character has a meaning, that makes perl programs often unreadable.\nWith Python, you need all those libraries... It's easy when you know the libraries, what  you have to call. When you know the arguments of the librairies... so it's also complicated. And if the library changes for some reasons, there you go.\nIn my humble opinion it's the same with all the languages. It starts easy from scratch but if you have to interface them with existing things from the internet world or whatever it gets complicated.\n\n**Do you have a last word?**\n\nI was surprised by your group reaction to the visit. I thought all of this was known. Maybe I'm getting old :) Currently I don't do much about the museum department, but sometimes I like to talk about the little stories about it. I remember a lot of little stories, a lot of technics who have been used and forgotten and some kept alive. I thought when I was young that the best techniques would succeed. That you would have visionary people who would see the way. But I realized that a lot of things do happen by accident.\n\n\n\n\n\n","attribs":"*7+a*7*3+p*7|1+1*g|2+21*6|1+1*h*5+6*5+2w*f*5+8*5+h*6|1+1*5+4a*6|2+2*h+6+9*f+1+1o*d+n+1y*f+1+19*f+1+10*d+1+3e*f+1+3s*6|2+2+4n*6|1+1|1+1*h*5+6*f*5+4*5+t*6|2+2*h+6+l*h+1+16*e+1+17*f+2+1e*f+2+1e*d+2+3a*h|1+2*h*e+2*e+k+1*h|1+1+1j*6|2+2+1h*f+5+1h*0+m+45*0+m+2z*6|2+2+e*f+1+8f*f+1+p*d+1+q*f+1+d*d+1+3j*6|2+2+t*f+6+14*f+2+49*d+8+15*6|2+2*h*5+6*5+16*6|2+2*h+6+t*h+1+h*d+1+1u*d+6+1y*6|2+2*h*5+2*5+13*6|2+2+2p*d+1+3f*d+a+o*d+1+1b*d+1+2*d+l+9*d+2a+1*e+14+19*d+1+1b*d+u+1*6|2+2*5+1r*6|2+2+c*d+1+6*f+2+9*f+1+7*f+1+s*d+1+8*f+3+1k*d+a+9*d+1+1*d+1+r*d+u+1*d+n+e*d*e+4*e+8+1c*h+1+g*d+1+2*d+1+s*d+4+h*d|1+1+2r*d+9+1l*0+1+2s*d+3+33*6|1+1+41*6|2+2*5+1a*6|2+2+i*f+1+7*f+1+3s*d+4+x*6|2+2*5+1t*f*5+1*5+12*6|2+2+8*f+1+7m*d+4+q*d+9+f*d|1+1+f*d+1+27*d+1+7*d+1+9*d+1+t*d+2+w*d+6+e*d+e+2*d+2+r*d+m+g*d+9+q*e+i*d+1+3q*6|2+2*5+1f*6|2+2+43*0+1+f*0+2+4*d+a+1g*d+n+z*d+2*h+1*d+1+3z*d+1+10*d+4+5*d+3+1n*d+6+p*d+4+f*d+1+1l*d+1+j*d+c+16*d+h+8*d+11+p*0+i*h+1*0+9*h+2*0+2a*h+1+1k*d+2+3f*d+4+1*6|1+1+x*0+1*h+2*0+d*h+1*0+11+1*0*2+1*0+37+2q*0+4+2*0|1+21*0+1f+1v*0+1+1*h+2*0+2d*h+1*0+d1*d|1+1*d+1+1j*d+a+1z*0+1*d|1+1+d*d+t+7*d+2+4*d+5+1*d+2+1*d+l+1*d+c+n*d+p+14*d+1+1k*d+9+1r*d+p+1q*h+1*d+p+c*d+6+7*0|2+2*5+1v*h|1+1*0|1+1+1i*h+1+2f*0+4+10*h+1+3s*h+1+1o*0|2+2*5+5m*h|1+1*0|1+1+i*d+1+1*d+2+29*d+7+1*0|1+1*d+2+1f*d+7+d*d+6+z*d+1+11*d+1+1*2+e*d*2+1*2+e*d*2+1*2+b+83*d+1j+2*0|1+1+1*0|1+1*5+1y*h|1+1*0|1+1+n*h+1+15*d+1+f*d+5+1k*d+3+1*d+6+d*h+1+2u*h+1+5x*d|1+1+90*d|1+1+1h*d+8+m*d+o+m*d+b+10*e+9+1*d+1+2j*d+35+r*0|1+1+1*0|1+1*5+4r*h|1+1*0|1+1+1c*d+6+z*d+1+6*d+2+1h*d+5+5*d+5+9*d+c+5s*h+1+1a*d+6+8*d+4+b*d+3+i*d+3+n*d+3*0|1+1+3o*d+9+a*d+5+42*h+1+46*d+b+2o*d|1+1+3n*h+1+21*d+i+7*d+1+1*d|1+1*d+1a+7p*0|2+2*h*5+2*5+v*h*5+2*h|1+1*0|1+1+5m*0|2+2*h*5+2*5+1q*h*5+2*h|1+1*0|1+1+1f*d+3+3o*h+1+q*0|2+2*h*5+2*5+16*h*5+2*h|1+1*0|1+1+5b*0|1+1+1a*h+1+2a*0|2+2*h*5+2*5+m*h*5+2*h|1+1*0|1+1+18*d+5+2z*h+1+l*h+1+1*h+1+u*d+8+d*h|1+1*h*e+2*e+d*h|1+1+27*d+1+1k*d+4+1h*d+4+9*d+e+i*0|2+2*h*5+2*5+t*h*5+2*h|1+1*0|1+1+2l*h+1+f*d+3+t*d+8+e*h+1+i*h+1+t*d+2+4*h+1*d+1+m*d+a*h+1*d+2+c*h+1+1h*d+2+3b*0|2+2*h*5+2*5+27*h*5+2*h|1+1*0|1+1+1f*d+2+4*d+6+c*d+y+3s*h+1+1x*h+1+21*d+2+3s*d+8+p*0|2+2*h*5+2*5+1q*h*5+2*h|1+1*0|1+1+2f*d+1+14*h+1+42*0|2+2*h*5+2*5+t*h*5+2*h|1+1*0|1+1+2i*h+1+3w*d+3+4l*h+1+4f*0|2+2*h*5+2*5+u*h*5+2*h|1+1*0|1+1+10*d+5+f*d+4+r*h+1+1x*0|1+1+2e*h+1+w*d+11*0|2+2*h*5+2*5+p*h*5+1*5+1u*h*5+2*h|1+1*0|1+1+3q*h+1+16*h+1+4m*h+1+j*h+1+17*h+1+1y*h+1+1h*h+1+q*h+1+1g*h+1+2c*h+1+2i*h+1+b*0|2+2*h*5+2*5+3f*h*5+2*h|1+1*0|1+1+2j*h+1+f*d+1+a*d+8+c*d+5+4m*d+6+3f*d+1+5*d+5+h*d+1+1*d+e+e*d|1+1+1l*h+1+a*h+1+3c*d+4*h+1+e*d+1+l*h+1+i*d+2+i*d+9+o*d|1+19+18*h+1+11*d+4*h+1*d+2+1v*h+1+r*h+1+n*d+1+w*d|1+1+1g*h+1+2f*d+1+1l*0|2+2*h*5+2*5+o*h*5+2*h|1+1*0|1+1+24*d+2+e*h+1+l*h+1+6*h+1+1m*h+1+4s*h+1+37*h+1+t*d+4+k*0|1+1*6|3+3*0|1+1|1+1"}}},"pad:observatory.guide.jeanhuensitvextended:revs:9501":{"changeset":"Z:f7x>1|r=2bg=2*h*5+1$P","meta":{"author":"a.eJQfyC3773rYpTah","timestamp":1518882192981}},"pad:observatory.guide.jeanhuensitvextended:revs:9502":{"changeset":"Z:f7y>2|r=2bg=3*h*5+2$P:","meta":{"author":"a.eJQfyC3773rYpTah","timestamp":1518882193484}},"pad:observatory.guide.jeanhuensitvextended:revs:9503":{"changeset":"Z:f80>1|r=2bg=5*h*5+1$

HEADER: Interview with Jean Huens\n\n[short intro, when where ... interview with Jan Heuns, xxxx Peggy ... ]\n\n% PP: You have been using computers since a long time, as you explained us during the tour we had the joy of attending during the TGSO.\nI heard that that until recently, let's say the late 1990's, when learning computer programming you had to start by  writing down the program on paper... \n\n% JH: In 1973, I did study computer sciences, it was the second year of the Computer Sciense course, here in Leuven. At the time computers were mainframes and you did feed them with programms by punch cards. Programming was writing down the program, then you punched it and the next day you get results, mostly error. That's the way it worked at that time. To teach us programming, they used the langage of that time, Fortran and some kind of invented assembly langage, it didn't really exist, it was simplified.\n\nMost of the time you did write down your program, the teacher and the assistant would have to tell you what is wrong or good, you didn't had much practical experience.\n\n% PP: What was it like, tons of pages? \n\n% JH: No. As an anecdocte, I remember punchcards were a block of papers, we were jealous of the people who came into the computer center with huge stacks of cards. They were really small programs, not complicated one. In fact you had to learn to use the computer from scratch, everything was new, you couldn't rely on previous experiences.\n% , everything was new.\nAnd to start with small programs was difficult enough. \n\nThat was also the time when Edsger W. Dijkstra, who fought against the goto and other common but bad constructs [@tdijksra:1972:goto]. I still remember him, in an audience, giving us a lecture on good  techniques in programming at the International computing symposium 1977 in Liège [@dijksra:1977:craft]. It was a rather hard course because Dijkstra expected you to quickly  understand and implement his ideas.\n\nAnd then from '75 on, computers became cheaper and could be bought by departments and smaller entities. And than came the first interactive computer. Still beasts about two cubic meters, costing two millions belgian francs. But it was low enough to allow people to type in directly commands. I started working here in '75 as a researcher, it has evolved continuously and I saw computers getting cheaper and getting easier to use.The way to use it was simplified, you could start to go to the beast and try it out.\n\nI remember more or less: you wrote down the program in Fortran for instance. We always thought in the beginning that it would work and it didn't, so after a turn around you were giving it back to the operator and you have to wait another half a day or a night to get the results.\n\n% PP: What kind of program you were working on? \n\n% JH: I remember the first program I had to write was: you got three numbers, you had to make the program decide if you could construct a triangle with the numbers being the sides of the triangle.\n\n% PP: That took an afternoon to be processed?\n\n% JH: Well, yeah. You had to imagine how to do it which was also one problem, than you prepare the cards with the punching machine and you give the package of cards to the operator who was feeeding the computer with the cards. Operator people had the taks to feed the computers by hands, with paper, cards, then cards got written on disks and later processed by the mainframe from disk. Finally results got printed on paper. it lasts onto the magnetic disks period. And after a number of hours or a night you got a listing, a piece of paper, with the results or program compilation errors.\n\n% PP: When where you able to record the program onto the machine?\n\n% JH: I think that happened between '75 and '80. After the punching cards, which were already a way to record the program, we had typewriters and then terminals. We could record the programs by typing it on the terminal  and the computer would store them on disk. We had magnetic discs. IBM had number for everything, I remember the 3300  [manufactured from 1970 on] was a magnetic disk. \nWe didn't touch the machines, operators would change the disks, we could only access the typewriter/terminal. That was our most direct connexion to the computer. The times were diffent. The mainframes were such huge costly beasts that it had operators day and night to keep it busy. Even at night there were two or three guys mounting tapes, dismounting tapes, that kind of stuff.\nhttps://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/42/IBM_magnetic_disk_drives_3330%2B3333.png/600px-IBM_magnetic_disk_drives_3330%2B3333.png\n\n% PP: When did you stop working with operators?\n\n% JH: Somewhere between '85 and '90. There were still operators at the main computer of the university, but there were also small computers, so researchers and student could have direct access when needed. \n\n% PP: When did you start to work with software sold by others or given away in order to do your research?\n\n% JH: You still need an operating system on the mainframe that was delivered by IBM or the constructor delivering the mainframe. When you bought mini-computers, which were the  smaller versions of mainframes, in most cases you did buy an operating systems, compilers and all the stuff you did need to be able to program or work  those things. \nIn most cases,  the computer sciences department did buy the mini-computer from, for instance *Digital Equipment Corporation*,  a manufactorer at that time, but they didn't buy DEC's  software. The DEC software  was not open source or free,  and as a university we could get Unix for free and could run it on those digital equipment  DEC computers. That is what the computer department of the University of Louvain la Neuve *l'unité d'informatique*, did and so did we.\n\n% PP: When did you start working with unix as an os? \n\n% JH: I took a trip to Amsterdam, it must have been in 1979/80… Well, the story starts in our french sister university (LLN) where they did have a PDP-11 with Unix on it. You could get Unix, at the time, when you were a university, from Bell Labs (part of AT&T), the american telephone company. AT&T was a mega organisation at the time [before the [dismantlment of AT&T/Bell system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breakup_of_the_Bell_System)]. Due to monopoly, the US authorities did split it up in different Baby Bells. One of the restriction was that the research baby bell, could not sell anything. There were computer scientists there, who did develop some interesting things (e.g. Unix). For universities you did get the source for free, but NO  support, nothing not even how to install it. In Unité d'informatique, where they had a [PDP-11/70](https://i0.wp.com/www.utterpower.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/pdp11-70-panel.jpg) they were lucky: they got the same computer that unix was developped on.  They got the disk by snail mail as a post-office package. They mounted it and it did spin up and they had UNIX.\nHere, we did have a cheaper PDP11, [the PDP 11/60](https://dave.cheney.net/tag/pdp-11). We got the Unix disk distribution from Bell Labs but we could not run it, because we got another type of disk(RK07). We could look at it but that was all, because our disc format was different than the one at Bell Labs. Somebody here (P.Verbaeten) did write a driver for that disk in l'unité \nd'informatique of LLN. But they did not have a RK07.  it did compile it but we couldn't try it because we did not have. The nearest place  with Unix and RK07 was in Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam.  Andrew Tenenbaum, who did write a number of books on operating systems, was working there. He was learning to speak dutch. We did understood his english better but his assistant explained that he needed to practice speaking Dutch because he would have to pass an exam. There we compiled Unix with an RK07 driver and stored it on a bootable RK07 disk. With that disk back in Leuven we could start Unix on our PDP11/60. An error in the process meant a trip Leuven-Amsterdam and back.\nIn my opinion the start of open source was Unix because everybody  had to maintain it by ourselves and we learned a lot from the sources. \nIn that time for software distribution you did have to store it on magnetic tape and send the tape us to different places with associated problems. For example,  the agents at the customs at the airport or post didn't know what to do with the tapes or discs in terms of custom clearance. They used magnetic or xrays as inspection tools and we had to write on the package that it should not be x-rayed. And sometimes we still got unreadable tapes/discs. \n\n% PP: So it took like weeks between the transportation, the custom...\n\n% JH: Yes, the custom had to clear the packages. I remember I've been in the customs in Zaventem. I had received a letter that my package from Bell Labs had arrived. I went there thinking I would have to pay something and go. But no. It had to be cleared so there wa some organisation that had to do administrative stuff, so I only got it a few days later. The response time was huge :)\n\n% PP: Than after that period of time how did you switch from that kind of collaboration on how to make software and make software work to collaboration on networks, between universities and researchers...\n\n% JH: In the Unix systems at that time there was a kind of networking protocol which did work on serial lines (UUCP).\nTo connect two unix systems together you only need a serial line. We had a line between LLN and Leuven, it's only 25 kms, but we had to ask Belgacom, then La Régie des Télégraphes et Téléphones, to get a modem to connect through their network and than over that modem you could reach an amazing speed of 300 characters per second. And that was the first communication. It did happened somewhere around 85. And then you had connexion with another computer, writing something here and do the transfer to the other computer and execute it there. \n \n% PP: What was the first thing you did send through a network like this?\n\n% JH: I didn't do it myself, I remember it was a kind of chat program. On LLN side was Prof.Elie Milgrom, he is retired now. On this side, it was Prof.  Yves Willems. And I remember that they typed something and they got a response from the other side and that was it.  But I remember that Pr Willems sent \"ok we stop now\". And that Elie Milgrom answered \"See you later, Alligator\" [a reference to Bill Haley and the Comets].  At the time we still had these kind of songs in mind. (lol). \nThose Unix to Unix connexions were first. And there was a worldwide Unix to Unix based network, Usenet (1979), it still exists somewhere... you can download load  of illegal movies and that stuff, that was not what we meant at the time. But that is what is left. And Usenet became gradually replaced by the Internet in USA. \nIn Europe, the Internet came a lot later, but we had limited access to the Internet by mail and even FTP; We could send mail to the Internet and we could receive mail from them, because Some friendly american university, later companies, did translate internet mail to UCP mail., moreover they did translate specially formatted mails into FTP request and send the result back to us by mail. That was before the 1990's.\n \n% PP:Your relation to software had changed at the time because you did not have to do all this manipulations with the software your received... Was it already floppy discs?\n\nNo, magnetic tapes, for the mainframe at least. Even most of the mini-computers had some (cheaper) magnetic tapes. Between 90 and 95 the main machines used for  Unix software development was a VAX from DEC. Once a year the software came from Berkeley, it was still Unix but modified by Berkeley for virtual memory and all the stuff which are common now. We received a tape, with lot of goodies, I still remember we didn't know what was on the tape  but we did scrutinise it  to know what was on there, what we can use....\nIn Europe, companies like Siemens were trying to set up software centers to make software avaiable, they were even trying to set up European networks. But researchers did love the Internet, it worked, it was useful for their researchs. So companies in Europe, were trying to set up their own networks, I remember for example the X/OPEN transport protocol. Their was a lot of standards about what software layers should do, but it didn't succeed because around 1992 IBM decided to quit their own private network and to go forTCP/IP and was the switching point. \nEverything done for X/OPEN were suddently forgotten. For the mainframes, and certainly in Belgium computing was mainly mainframes, I'm talking about universities here, so when IBM decided to go for TCP/IP Univiversities did follow. \nBut the aceptation of TCP/IP was really slow. For example, Belgacom was not interested in running the Domain Name System so we did it here, for some time, starting in 1993 with Pierre Verbaten (https://www.dnsbelgium.be/en/history). Belgacom were focused on X25 (DCS - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X.25) so they missed it.\n\n**It was like the french Minitel?**\n\nWell, at that time we were really jealous about Minitel. Could you imagine that? Terminals?  At home? You could work home with a computer! You could send emails! All in one, a pc computer with a modem! \n\n**How did the research about software evolved in the department?**\n\nI am mainly talking about network research but here. There were people working on numerical analysis, computing, artificial intelligence ... I was just not involved in those research so I don't know much about it \n\n**You were focused on software and network..**\n\nYes, we did produce some software. We did make software to generate compilers, there was some A.I. software in Prolog, numerical analysis  libraries... Some were sold or shared, it depends.  \nWe did sell some software since the beginning I think when it was not even a department but a professor and a couple of students.\n\n**Is it when you joined?**\n\nNo it was already a department. I did study first industrial engeneering in electronics. At the time in electronics you did hear something about computers, I was interested in it. I wanted to know more. I heard Kuleuvenhad started a\n% year before a\ndegree in computer engeneering. It was the first year where industrial engineers could join. The only thing we knew about computer were from movies. I wanted to know how it work. I'm not sure if I know now it now, but I have some ideas...\n\n**How many langage do you know?**\n\nAssembly, FORTRAN, PL-1 the langage invented by IBM to be the universal one, C, Cobol. Perl, I don't know, some  more. I'm not fluent in any computer langage, but I can read any language especially well written, I know I can understand it and, if needed,  learn it... I know JAVA also. As a system administrator the thing I use most are the command line of UNIX and Perl. But that's because i'm more familiar with those two so it goes faster.\n\n**How did you see the rise of personnal computer and the software that goes with?**\n\nI have to admit that we missed it. We didn't see the new thing was powerful because available for everybody.  We were not impressed by the software. I remember windows 95, the news on TV, people sleeping on the street to get it. I remember when I get my first windows version, with a box of 22 floppies or so. Then I wanted to do something, to compile a program, but there was no compiler... We were used to Unix, a basic system but with a lot of utilities in it. Software was for us free, and we were used to have it free and on a pc it was not free anymore. \n\n**Does that mean you didn't had a personnal computer until late?**\n\nYes. I think it was round 2000. I didn't needed it really. I got one when the belgian UUCP network became commercial. Of course I did not get Windows on it.  I think we got Linux here in 1994. There was a guy involved in the kernel studying here. So we did used it very fast.\n\n**So, what is software for you?**\n\nFor me software is the magic that make computer usable. I can only gives examples of what I mean by it. A PC without software most people, even computer scientists, can't do anything with it. You need basic software. Some software is already integrated in the computer hardware. Same for phones, tablets... The main characteristic, for me, is that it should be user friendly. That is very difficult I know, because you have to imagine what the people using your software are going to do with it and how they want to use it, that's the magic you need to solve.\n\n**Is command line user friendly?**\n\nWell, somehow you have to learn the Unix command langage; it is in fact a computer language where you can make all the constructs that other langages offers.\nYou can create loops, you can test, whatever. It's not so different from computer languages like C or JAVA or whatever. It is certainly programmer friendly.\n\n**But it's already software, no? User friendly depends on what you put behind these words, no?**\n\nYes it's already software. I don't have a strong opinion about command lines. It depends on people. I can imagine that someone that has never heard about the command line expects that you click somewhere and it happens. But if you know the command langage it's sometimes perhaps easier or productive to type commands and let it run. Sometimes, I find it easier if I have a screen and a number of buttons and I don't have to imagine what happens behind that screen. And sometimes I want to do something with the command line, because I'm used to it. That's why I don't trust myself about user friendliness because I have a long experience in computer interfaces. I'm so used to some of them perhaps I can't even imagine that somebody else would like to do it otherwise or doesn't like what I'm used to.\n\n**Apart from maintaining the museum, what do you work on? You are still active in the department even though you are retired?**\n\nI work on sensors, in the internet of things world in one of the university spin-off. What I do for them is: wireless sensors need power, most  of them are on batteries. They have designed a complete system which should make the battery last for two, three, four years. They need a system to measure that. So I have been working on a mechanism to measure that without waiting four years. That's programming instrumentation computers to measure e.g. power or whatever. Most of it on Unix systems. \nThere are enough new or unknown things and maybe because I'm older, I have another way of looking at things, so we have a lot of discussions. They don't like my Perl, they use python, JAVA and those things... Perl, it has its disadvantage, but you can do a lot of things. Every  character has a meaning, that makes perl programs often unreadable.\nWith Python, you need all those libraries... It's easy when you know the libraries, what  you have to call. When you know the arguments of the librairies... so it's also complicated. And if the library changes for some reasons, there you go.\nIn my humble opinion it's the same with all the languages. It starts easy from scratch but if you have to interface them with existing things from the internet world or whatever it gets complicated.\n\n**Do you have a last word?**\n\nI was surprised by your group reaction to the visit. I thought all of this was known. Maybe I'm getting old :) Currently I don't do much about the museum department, but sometimes I like to talk about the little stories about it. I remember a lot of little stories, a lot of technics who have been used and forgotten and some kept alive. I thought when I was young that the best techniques would succeed.

HEADER: Interview with Jean Huens\n\n[short intro, when where ... interview with Jan Heuns, xxxx Peggy ... ]\n\n% PP: You have been using computers since a long time, as you explained us during the tour we had the joy of attending during the TGSO.\nI heard that that until recently, let's say the late 1990's, when learning computer programming you had to start by  writing down the program on paper... \n\n% JH: In 1973, I did study computer sciences, it was the second year of the Computer Sciense course, here in Leuven. At the time computers were mainframes and you did feed them with programms by punch cards. Programming was writing down the program, then you punched it and the next day you get results, mostly error. That's the way it worked at that time. To teach us programming, they used the langage of that time, Fortran and some kind of invented assembly langage, it didn't really exist, it was simplified.\n\nMost of the time you did write down your program, the teacher and the assistant would have to tell you what is wrong or good, you didn't had much practical experience.\n\n% PP: What was it like, tons of pages? \n\n% JH: No. As an anecdocte, I remember punchcards were a block of papers, we were jealous of the people who came into the computer center with huge stacks of cards. They were really small programs, not complicated one. In fact you had to learn to use the computer from scratch, everything was new, you couldn't rely on previous experiences.\n% , everything was new.\nAnd to start with small programs was difficult enough. \n\nThat was also the time when Edsger W. Dijkstra, who fought against the goto and other common but bad constructs [@tdijksra:1972:goto]. I still remember him, in an audience, giving us a lecture on good  techniques in programming at the International computing symposium 1977 in Liège [@dijksra:1977:craft]. It was a rather hard course because Dijkstra expected you to quickly  understand and implement his ideas.\n\nAnd then from '75 on, computers became cheaper and could be bought by departments and smaller entities. And than came the first interactive computer. Still beasts about two cubic meters, costing two millions belgian francs. But it was low enough to allow people to type in directly commands. I started working here in '75 as a researcher, it has evolved continuously and I saw computers getting cheaper and getting easier to use.The way to use it was simplified, you could start to go to the beast and try it out.\n\nI remember more or less: you wrote down the program in Fortran for instance. We always thought in the beginning that it would work and it didn't, so after a turn around you were giving it back to the operator and you have to wait another half a day or a night to get the results.\n\n% PP: What kind of program you were working on? \n\n% JH: I remember the first program I had to write was: you got three numbers, you had to make the program decide if you could construct a triangle with the numbers being the sides of the triangle.\n\n% PP: That took an afternoon to be processed?\n\n% JH: Well, yeah. You had to imagine how to do it which was also one problem, than you prepare the cards with the punching machine and you give the package of cards to the operator who was feeeding the computer with the cards. Operator people had the taks to feed the computers by hands, with paper, cards, then cards got written on disks and later processed by the mainframe from disk. Finally results got printed on paper. it lasts onto the magnetic disks period. And after a number of hours or a night you got a listing, a piece of paper, with the results or program compilation errors.\n\n% PP: When where you able to record the program onto the machine?\n\n% JH: I think that happened between '75 and '80. After the punching cards, which were already a way to record the program, we had typewriters and then terminals. We could record the programs by typing it on the terminal  and the computer would store them on disk. We had magnetic discs. IBM had number for everything, I remember the 3300  [manufactured from 1970 on] was a magnetic disk. \nWe didn't touch the machines, operators would change the disks, we could only access the typewriter/terminal. That was our most direct connexion to the computer. The times were diffent. The mainframes were such huge costly beasts that it had operators day and night to keep it busy. Even at night there were two or three guys mounting tapes, dismounting tapes, that kind of stuff.\nhttps://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/42/IBM_magnetic_disk_drives_3330%2B3333.png/600px-IBM_magnetic_disk_drives_3330%2B3333.png\n\n% PP: When did you stop working with operators?\n\n% JH: Somewhere between '85 and '90. There were still operators at the main computer of the university, but there were also small computers, so researchers and student could have direct access when needed. \n\n% PP: When did you start to work with software sold by others or given away in order to do your research?\n\n% JH: You still need an operating system on the mainframe that was delivered by IBM or the constructor delivering the mainframe. When you bought mini-computers, which were the  smaller versions of mainframes, in most cases you did buy an operating systems, compilers and all the stuff you did need to be able to program or work  those things. \nIn most cases,  the computer sciences department did buy the mini-computer from, for instance *Digital Equipment Corporation*,  a manufactorer at that time, but they didn't buy DEC's  software. The DEC software  was not open source or free,  and as a university we could get Unix for free and could run it on those digital equipment  DEC computers. That is what the computer department of the University of Louvain la Neuve *l'unité d'informatique*, did and so did we.\n\n% PP: When did you start working with unix as an os? \n\n% JH: I took a trip to Amsterdam, it must have been in 1979/80… Well, the story starts in our french sister university (LLN) where they did have a PDP-11 with Unix on it. You could get Unix, at the time, when you were a university, from Bell Labs (part of AT&T), the american telephone company. AT&T was a mega organisation at the time [before the [dismantlment of AT&T/Bell system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breakup_of_the_Bell_System)]. Due to monopoly, the US authorities did split it up in different Baby Bells. One of the restriction was that the research baby bell, could not sell anything. There were computer scientists there, who did develop some interesting things (e.g. Unix). For universities you did get the source for free, but NO  support, nothing not even how to install it. In Unité d'informatique, where they had a [PDP-11/70](https://i0.wp.com/www.utterpower.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/pdp11-70-panel.jpg) they were lucky: they got the same computer that unix was developped on.  They got the disk by snail mail as a post-office package. They mounted it and it did spin up and they had UNIX.\nHere, we did have a cheaper PDP11, [the PDP 11/60](https://dave.cheney.net/tag/pdp-11). We got the Unix disk distribution from Bell Labs but we could not run it, because we got another type of disk(RK07). We could look at it but that was all, because our disc format was different than the one at Bell Labs. Somebody here (P.Verbaeten) did write a driver for that disk in l'unité \nd'informatique of LLN. But they did not have a RK07.  it did compile it but we couldn't try it because we did not have. The nearest place  with Unix and RK07 was in Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam.  Andrew Tenenbaum, who did write a number of books on operating systems, was working there. He was learning to speak dutch. We did understood his english better but his assistant explained that he needed to practice speaking Dutch because he would have to pass an exam. There we compiled Unix with an RK07 driver and stored it on a bootable RK07 disk. With that disk back in Leuven we could start Unix on our PDP11/60. An error in the process meant a trip Leuven-Amsterdam and back.\nIn my opinion the start of open source was Unix because everybody  had to maintain it by ourselves and we learned a lot from the sources. \nIn that time for software distribution you did have to store it on magnetic tape and send the tape us to different places with associated problems. For example,  the agents at the customs at the airport or post didn't know what to do with the tapes or discs in terms of custom clearance. They used magnetic or xrays as inspection tools and we had to write on the package that it should not be x-rayed. And sometimes we still got unreadable tapes/discs. \n\n% PP: So it took like weeks between the transportation, the custom...\n\n% JH: Yes, the custom had to clear the packages. I remember I've been in the customs in Zaventem. I had received a letter that my package from Bell Labs had arrived. I went there thinking I would have to pay something and go. But no. It had to be cleared so there wa some organisation that had to do administrative stuff, so I only got it a few days later. The response time was huge :)\n\n% PP: Than after that period of time how did you switch from that kind of collaboration on how to make software and make software work to collaboration on networks, between universities and researchers...\n\n% JH: In the Unix systems at that time there was a kind of networking protocol which did work on serial lines (UUCP).\nTo connect two unix systems together you only need a serial line. We had a line between LLN and Leuven, it's only 25 kms, but we had to ask Belgacom, then La Régie des Télégraphes et Téléphones, to get a modem to connect through their network and than over that modem you could reach an amazing speed of 300 characters per second. And that was the first communication. It did happened somewhere around 85. And then you had connexion with another computer, writing something here and do the transfer to the other computer and execute it there. \n \n% PP: What was the first thing you did send through a network like this?\n\n% JH: I didn't do it myself, I remember it was a kind of chat program. On LLN side was Prof.Elie Milgrom, he is retired now. On this side, it was Prof.  Yves Willems. And I remember that they typed something and they got a response from the other side and that was it.  But I remember that Pr Willems sent \"ok we stop now\". And that Elie Milgrom answered \"See you later, Alligator\" [a reference to Bill Haley and the Comets].  At the time we still had these kind of songs in mind. (lol). \nThose Unix to Unix connexions were first. And there was a worldwide Unix to Unix based network, Usenet (1979), it still exists somewhere... you can download load  of illegal movies and that stuff, that was not what we meant at the time. But that is what is left. And Usenet became gradually replaced by the Internet in USA. \nIn Europe, the Internet came a lot later, but we had limited access to the Internet by mail and even FTP; We could send mail to the Internet and we could receive mail from them, because Some friendly american university, later companies, did translate internet mail to UCP mail., moreover they did translate specially formatted mails into FTP request and send the result back to us by mail. That was before the 1990's.\n \n% PP: Your relation to software had changed at the time because you did not have to do all this manipulations with the software your received... Was it already floppy discs?\n\n% JH: No, magnetic tapes, for the mainframe at least. Even most of the mini-computers had some (cheaper) magnetic tapes. Between 90 and 95 the main machines used for  Unix software development was a VAX from DEC. Once a year the software came from Berkeley, it was still Unix but modified by Berkeley for virtual memory and all the stuff which are common now. We received a tape, with lot of goodies, I still remember we didn't know what was on the tape  but we did scrutinise it  to know what was on there, what we can use....\nIn Europe, companies like Siemens were trying to set up software centers to make software avaiable, they were even trying to set up European networks. But researchers did love the Internet, it worked, it was useful for their researchs. So companies in Europe, were trying to set up their own networks, I remember for example the X/OPEN transport protocol. Their was a lot of standards about what software layers should do, but it didn't succeed because around 1992 IBM decided to quit their own private network and to go forTCP/IP and was the switching point. \nEverything done for X/OPEN were suddently forgotten. For the mainframes, and certainly in Belgium computing was mainly mainframes, I'm talking about universities here, so when IBM decided to go for TCP/IP Univiversities did follow. \nBut the aceptation of TCP/IP was really slow. For example, Belgacom was not interested in running the Domain Name System so we did it here, for some time, starting in 1993 with Pierre Verbaten (https://www.dnsbelgium.be/en/history). Belgacom were focused on X25 (DCS - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X.25) so they missed it.\n\n% PP: It was like the french Minitel?\n\n% JH: Well, at that time we were really jealous about Minitel. Could you imagine that? Terminals?  At home? You could work home with a computer! You could send emails! All in one, a pc computer with a modem! \n\n% PP: How did the research about software evolved in the department?\n\n% JH: I am mainly talking about network research but here. There were people working on numerical analysis, computing, artificial intelligence ... I was just not involved in those research so I don't know much about it \n\n% PP: You were focused on software and network..\n\n% JH: Yes, we did produce some software. We did make software to generate compilers, there was some A.I. software in Prolog, numerical analysis  libraries... Some were sold or shared, it depends.  \nWe did sell some software since the beginning I think when it was not even a department but a professor and a couple of students.\n\n% PP: Is it when you joined?\n\n% JH: No it was already a department. I did study first industrial engeneering in electronics. At the time in electronics you did hear something about computers, I was interested in it. I wanted to know more. I heard Kuleuvenhad started a\n% year before a\ndegree in computer engeneering. It was the first year where industrial engineers could join. The only thing we knew about computer were from movies. I wanted to know how it work. I'm not sure if I know now it now, but I have some ideas...\n\n% PP: How many langage do you know?\n\n% JH: Assembly, FORTRAN, PL-1 the langage invented by IBM to be the universal one, C, Cobol. Perl, I don't know, some  more. I'm not fluent in any computer langage, but I can read any language especially well written, I know I can understand it and, if needed,  learn it... I know JAVA also. As a system administrator the thing I use most are the command line of UNIX and Perl. But that's because i'm more familiar with those two so it goes faster.\n\n% PP: How did you see the rise of personnal computer and the software that goes with?\n\n% JH: I have to admit that we missed it. We didn't see the new thing was powerful because available for everybody.  We were not impressed by the software. I remember windows 95, the news on TV, people sleeping on the street to get it. I remember when I get my first windows version, with a box of 22 floppies or so. Then I wanted to do something, to compile a program, but there was no compiler... We were used to Unix, a basic system but with a lot of utilities in it. Software was for us free, and we were used to have it free and on a pc it was not free anymore. \n\n% PP: Does that mean you didn't had a personnal computer until late?\n\n% JH: Yes. I think it was round 2000. I didn't needed it really. I got one when the belgian UUCP network became commercial. Of course I did not get Windows on it.  I think we got Linux here in 1994. There was a guy involved in the kernel studying here. So we did used it very fast.\n\n% PP: So, what is software for you?\n\n% JH: For me software is the magic that make computer usable. I can only gives examples of what I mean by it. A PC without software most people, even computer scientists, can't do anything with it. You need basic software. Some software is already integrated in the computer hardware. Same for phones, tablets... The main characteristic, for me, is that it should be user friendly. That is very difficult I know, because you have to imagine what the people using your software are going to do with it and how they want to use it, that's the magic you need to solve.\n\n% PPIs command line user friendly?\n\nWell, somehow you have to learn the Unix command langage; it is in fact a computer language where you can make all the constructs that other langages offers.\nYou can create loops, you can test, whatever. It's not so different from computer languages like C or JAVA or whatever. It is certainly programmer friendly.\n\n**But it's already software, no? User friendly depends on what you put behind these words, no?**\n\nYes it's already software. I don't have a strong opinion about command lines. It depends on people. I can imagine that someone that has never heard about the command line expects that you click somewhere and it happens. But if you know the command langage it's sometimes perhaps easier or productive to type commands and let it run. Sometimes, I find it easier if I have a screen and a number of buttons and I don't have to imagine what happens behind that screen. And sometimes I want to do something with the command line, because I'm used to it. That's why I don't trust myself about user friendliness because I have a long experience in computer interfaces. I'm so used to some of them perhaps I can't even imagine that somebody else would like to do it otherwise or doesn't like what I'm used to.\n\n**Apart from maintaining the museum, what do you work on? You are still active in the department even though you are retired?**\n\nI work on sensors, in the internet of things world in one of the university spin-off. What I do for them is: wireless sensors need power, most  of them are on batteries. They have designed a complete system which should make the battery last for two, three, four years. They need a system to measure that. So I have been working on a mechanism to measure that without waiting four years. That's programming instrumentation computers to measure e.g. power or whatever. Most of it on Unix systems. \nThere are enough new or unknown things and maybe because I'm older, I have another way of looking at things, so we have a lot of discussions. They don't like my Perl, they use python, JAVA and those things... Perl, it has its disadvantage, but you can do a lot of things. Every  character has a meaning, that makes perl programs often unreadable.\nWith Python, you need all those libraries... It's easy when you know the libraries, what  you have to call. When you know the arguments of the librairies... so it's also complicated. And if the library changes for some reasons, there you go.\nIn my humble opinion it's the same with all the languages. It starts easy from scratch but if you have to interface them with existing things from the internet world or whatever it gets complicated.\n\n**Do you have a last word?**\n\nI was surprised by your group reaction to the visit. I thought all of this was known. Maybe I'm getting old :) Currently I don't do much about the museum department, but sometimes I like to talk about the little stories about it. I remember a lot of little stories, a lot of technics who have been used and forgotten and some kept alive. I thought when I was young that the best techniques would succeed. That you would have visionary people who would see the way. But I realized that a lot of things do happen by accident.\n\n\n\n\n\n","attribs":"*7+a*7*3+p*7|1+1*g|2+21*6|1+1*h*5+6*5+2w*f*5+8*5+h*6|1+1*5+4a*6|2+2*h+6+9*f+1+1o*d+n+1y*f+1+19*f+1+10*d+1+3e*f+1+3s*6|2+2+4n*6|1+1|1+1*h*5+6*f*5+4*5+t*6|2+2*h+6+l*h+1+16*e+1+17*f+2+1e*f+2+1e*d+2+3a*h|1+2*h*e+2*e+k+1*h|1+1+1j*6|2+2+1h*f+5+1h*0+m+45*0+m+2z*6|2+2+e*f+1+8f*f+1+p*d+1+q*f+1+d*d+1+3j*6|2+2+t*f+6+14*f+2+49*d+8+15*6|2+2*h*5+6*5+16*6|2+2*h+6+t*h+1+h*d+1+1u*d+6+1y*6|2+2*h*5+6*5+13*6|2+2*h+6+2p*d+1+3f*d+a+o*d+1+1b*d+1+2*d+l+9*d+2a+1*e+14+19*d+1+1b*d+u+1*6|2+2*h*5+6*5+1n*6|2+2*h+6+c*d+1+6*f+2+9*f+1+7*f+1+s*d+1+8*f+3+1k*d+a+9*d+1+1*d+1+r*d+u+1*d+n+e*d*e+4*e+8+1c*h+1+g*d+1+2*d+1+s*d+4+h*d|1+1+2r*d+9+1l*0+1+2s*d+3+33*6|1+1+41*6|2+2*h*5+6*5+15*6|2+2*h+6+i*f+1+7*f+1+3s*d+4+x*6|2+2*h*5+6*5+1r*f*5+1*5+z*6|2+2*h+6+8*f+1+7m*d+4+q*d+9+f*d|1+1+f*d+1+27*d+1+7*d+1+9*d+1+t*d+2+w*d+6+e*d+e+2*d+2+r*d+m+g*d+9+q*e+i*d+1+3q*6|2+2*h*5+6*5+1b*6|2+2*h+6+43*0+1+f*0+2+4*d+a+1g*d+n+z*d+2*h+1*d+1+3z*d+1+10*d+4+5*d+3+1n*d+6+p*d+4+f*d+1+1l*d+1+j*d+c+16*d+h+8*d+11+p*0+i*h+1*0+9*h+2*0+2a*h+1+1k*d+2+3f*d+4+1*6|1+1+x*0+1*h+2*0+d*h+1*0+11+1*0*2+1*0+37+2q*0+4+2*0|1+21*0+1f+1v*0+1+1*h+2*0+2d*h+1*0+d1*d|1+1*d+1+1j*d+a+1z*0+1*d|1+1+d*d+t+7*d+2+4*d+5+1*d+2+1*d+l+1*d+c+n*d+p+14*d+1+1k*d+9+1r*d+p+1q*h+1*d+p+c*d+6+7*0|2+2*h*5+6*5+1r*h|1+1*0|1+1*h+6+1i*h+1+2f*0+4+10*h+1+3s*h+1+1o*0|2+2*h*5+6*5+5i*h|1+1*0|1+1*h+6+i*d+1+1*d+2+29*d+7+1*0|1+1*d+2+1f*d+7+d*d+6+z*d+1+11*d+1+1*2+e*d*2+1*2+e*d*2+1*2+b+83*d+1j+2*0|1+1+1*0|1+1*h*5+6*5+1u*h|1+1*0|1+1*h+6+n*h+1+15*d+1+f*d+5+1k*d+3+1*d+6+d*h+1+2u*h+1+5x*d|1+1+90*d|1+1+1h*d+8+m*d+o+m*d+b+10*e+9+1*d+1+2j*d+35+r*0|1+1+1*0|1+1*h*5+6*5+4n*h|1+1*0|1+1*h+6+1c*d+6+z*d+1+6*d+2+1h*d+5+5*d+5+9*d+c+5s*h+1+1a*d+6+8*d+4+b*d+3+i*d+3+n*d+3*0|1+1+3o*d+9+a*d+5+42*h+1+46*d+b+2o*d|1+1+3n*h+1+21*d+i+7*d+1+1*d|1+1*d+1a+7p*0|2+2*h*5+6*5+v*h|1+1*0|1+1*h+6+5m*0|2+2*h*5+6*5+1q*h|1+1*0|1+1*h+6+1f*d+3+3o*h+1+q*0|2+2*h*5+6*5+16*h|1+1*0|1+1*h+6+5b*0|1+1+1a*h+1+2a*0|2+2*h*5+6*5+m*h|1+1*0|1+1*h+6+18*d+5+2z*h+1+l*h+1+1*h+1+u*d+8+d*h|1+1*h*e+2*e+d*h|1+1+27*d+1+1k*d+4+1h*d+4+9*d+e+i*0|2+2*h*5+6*5+t*h|1+1*0|1+1*h+6+2l*h+1+f*d+3+t*d+8+e*h+1+i*h+1+t*d+2+4*h+1*d+1+m*d+a*h+1*d+2+c*h+1+1h*d+2+3b*0|2+2*h*5+6*5+27*h|1+1*0|1+1*h+6+1f*d+2+4*d+6+c*d+y+3s*h+1+1x*h+1+21*d+2+3s*d+8+p*0|2+2*h*5+6*5+1q*h|1+1*0|1+1*h+6+2f*d+1+14*h+1+42*0|2+2*h*5+6*5+t*h|1+1*0|1+1*h+6+2i*h+1+3w*d+3+4l*h+1+4f*0|2+2*h*5+4*5+u*h|1+1*0|1+1+10*d+5+f*d+4+r*h+1+1x*0|1+1+2e*h+1+w*d+11*0|2+2*h*5+2*5+p*h*5+1*5+1u*h*5+2*h|1+1*0|1+1+3q*h+1+16*h+1+4m*h+1+j*h+1+17*h+1+1y*h+1+1h*h+1+q*h+1+1g*h+1+2c*h+1+2i*h+1+b*0|2+2*h*5+2*5+3f*h*5+2*h|1+1*0|1+1+2j*h+1+f*d+1+a*d+8+c*d+5+4m*d+6+3f*d+1+5*d+5+h*d+1+1*d+e+e*d|1+1+1l*h+1+a*h+1+3c*d+4*h+1+e*d+1+l*h+1+i*d+2+i*d+9+o*d|1+19+18*h+1+11*d+4*h+1*d+2+1v*h+1+r*h+1+n*d+1+w*d|1+1+1g*h+1+2f*d+1+1l*0|2+2*h*5+2*5+o*h*5+2*h|1+1*0|1+1+24*d+2+e*h+1+l*h+1+6*h+1+1m*h+1+4s*h+1+37*h+1+t*d+4+k*0|1+1*6|3+3*0|1+1|1+1"}}},"pad:observatory.guide.jeanhuensitvextended:revs:9701":{"changeset":"Z:fbp>2|33=cu2=4*h*5+2$:

HEADER: Interview with Jean Huens\n\n[short intro, when where ... interview with Jan Heuns, xxxx Peggy ... ]\n\n% PP: You have been using computers since a long time, as you explained us during the tour we had the joy of attending during the TGSO.\nI heard that that until recently, let's say the late 1990's, when learning computer programming you had to start by  writing down the program on paper... \n% JH: In 1973, I did study computer sciences, it was the second year of the Computer Sciense course, here in Leuven. At the time computers were mainframes and you did feed them with programms by punch cards. Programming was writing down the program, then you punched it and the next day you get results, mostly error. That's the way it worked at that time. To teach us programming, they used the langage of that time, Fortran and some kind of invented assembly langage, it didn't really exist, it was simplified.\n\nMost of the time you did write down your program, the teacher and the assistant would have to tell you what is wrong or good, you didn't had much practical experience.\n\n% PP: What was it like, tons of pages? \n% JH: No. As an anecdocte, I remember punchcards were a block of papers, we were jealous of the people who came into the computer center with huge stacks of cards. They were really small programs, not complicated one. In fact you had to learn to use the computer from scratch, everything was new, you couldn't rely on previous experiences.\n% , everything was new.\nAnd to start with small programs was difficult enough. \n\nThat was also the time when Edsger W. Dijkstra, who fought against the goto and other common but bad constructs.[@dijksra:1972:goto] I still remember him, in an audience, giving us a lecture on good  techniques in programming at the International computing symposium 1977 in Liège.[@dijksra:1977:craft] It was a rather hard course because Dijkstra expected you to quickly  understand and implement his ideas.\n\nAnd then from '75 on, computers became cheaper and could be bought by departments and smaller entities. And than came the first interactive computer. Still beasts about two cubic meters, costing two millions belgian francs. But it was low enough to allow people to type in directly commands. I started working here in '75 as a researcher, it has evolved continuously and I saw computers getting cheaper and getting easier to use.The way to use it was simplified, you could start to go to the beast and try it out.\n\nI remember more or less: you wrote down the program in Fortran for instance. We always thought in the beginning that it would work and it didn't, so after a turn around you were giving it back to the operator and you have to wait another half a day or a night to get the results.\n\n% PP: What kind of program you were working on? \n% JH: I remember the first program I had to write was: you got three numbers, you had to make the program decide if you could construct a triangle with the numbers being the sides of the triangle.\n\n% PP: That took an afternoon to be processed?\n% JH: Well, yeah. You had to imagine how to do it which was also one problem, than you prepare the cards with the punching machine and you give the package of cards to the operator who was feeeding the computer with the cards. Operator people had the taks to feed the computers by hands, with paper, cards, then cards got written on disks and later processed by the mainframe from disk. Finally results got printed on paper. it lasts onto the magnetic disks period. And after a number of hours or a night you got a listing, a piece of paper, with the results or program compilation errors.\n\n% PP: When where you able to record the program onto the machine?\n% JH: I think that happened between '75 and '80. After the punching cards, which were already a way to record the program, we had typewriters and then terminals. We could record the programs by typing it on the terminal  and the computer would store them on disk. We had magnetic discs. IBM had number for everything, I remember the 3300  [manufactured from 1970 on] was a magnetic disk. \nWe didn't touch the machines, operators would change the disks, we could only access the typewriter/terminal. That was our most direct connexion to the computer. The times were diffent. The mainframes were such huge costly beasts that it had operators day and night to keep it busy. Even at night there were two or three guys mounting tapes, dismounting tapes, that kind of stuff.\nhttps://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/42/IBM_magnetic_disk_drives_3330%2B3333.png/600px-IBM_magnetic_disk_drives_3330%2B3333.png\n\n% PP: When did you stop working with operators?\n% JH: Somewhere between '85 and '90. There were still operators at the main computer of the university, but there were also small computers, so researchers and student could have direct access when needed. \n\n% PP: When did you start to work with software sold by others or given away in order to do your research?\n% JH: You still need an operating system on the mainframe that was delivered by IBM or the constructor delivering the mainframe. When you bought mini-computers, which were the  smaller versions of mainframes, in most cases you did buy an operating systems, compilers and all the stuff you did need to be able to program or work  those things. \nIn most cases,  the computer sciences department did buy the mini-computer from, for instance *Digital Equipment Corporation*,  a manufactorer at that time, but they didn't buy DEC's  software. The DEC software  was not open source or free,  and as a university we could get Unix for free and could run it on those\n% digital equipment \nDEC computers. That is what the computer department of the University of Louvain la Neuve *l'unité d'informatique*, did and so did we.\n\n% PP: When did you start working with unix as an os? \n% JH: I took a trip to Amsterdam, it must have been in 1979/80… Well, the story starts in our french sister university (LLN) where they did have a PDP-11 with Unix on it. You could get Unix, at the time, when you were a university, from Bell Labs (part of AT&T), the american telephone company. AT&T was a mega organisation at the time [before the [dismantlment of AT&T/Bell system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breakup_of_the_Bell_System)]. Due to monopoly, the US authorities did split it up in different Baby Bells. One of the restriction was that the research baby bell, could not sell anything. There were computer scientists there, who did develop some interesting things (e.g. Unix). For universities you did get the source for free, but NO  support, nothing not even how to install it. In Unité d'informatique, where they had a [PDP-11/70](https://i0.wp.com/www.utterpower.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/pdp11-70-panel.jpg) they were lucky: they got the same computer that unix was developped on.  They got the disk by snail mail as a post-office package. They mounted it and it did spin up and they had UNIX.\nHere, we did have a cheaper PDP11, [the PDP 11/60](https://dave.cheney.net/tag/pdp-11). We got the Unix disk distribution from Bell Labs but we could not run it, because we got another type of disk(RK07). We could look at it but that was all, because our disc format was different than the one at Bell Labs. Somebody here (P.Verbaeten) did write a driver for that disk in l'unité \nd'informatique of LLN. But they did not have a RK07.  it did compile it but we couldn't try it because we did not have. The nearest place  with Unix and RK07 was in Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam.  Andrew Tenenbaum, who did write a number of books on operating systems, was working there. He was learning to speak dutch. We did understood his english better but his assistant explained that he needed to practice speaking Dutch because he would have to pass an exam. There we compiled Unix with an RK07 driver and stored it on a bootable RK07 disk. With that disk back in Leuven we could start Unix on our PDP11/60. An error in the process meant a trip Leuven-Amsterdam and back.\nIn my opinion the start of open source was Unix because everybody  had to maintain it by ourselves and we learned a lot from the sources. \nIn that time for software distribution you did have to store it on magnetic tape and send the tape us to different places with associated problems. For example,  the agents at the customs at the airport or post didn't know what to do with the tapes or discs in terms of custom clearance. They used magnetic or xrays as inspection tools and we had to write on the package that it should not be x-rayed. And sometimes we still got unreadable tapes/discs. \n\n% PP: So it took like weeks between the transportation, the custom...\n% JH: Yes, the custom had to clear the packages. I remember I've been in the customs in Zaventem. I had received a letter that my package from Bell Labs had arrived. I went there thinking I would have to pay something and go. But no. It had to be cleared so there wa some organisation that had to do administrative stuff, so I only got it a few days later. The response time was huge :)\n\n% PP: Than after that period of time how did you switch from that kind of collaboration on how to make software and make software work to collaboration on networks, between universities and researchers...\n% JH: In the Unix systems at that time there was a kind of networking protocol which did work on serial lines (UUCP).\nTo connect two unix systems together you only need a serial line. We had a line between LLN and Leuven, it's only 25 kms, but we had to ask Belgacom, then La Régie des Télégraphes et Téléphones, to get a modem to connect through their network and than over that modem you could reach an amazing speed of 300 characters per second. And that was the first communication. It did happened somewhere around 85. And then you had connexion with another computer, writing something here and do the transfer to the other computer and execute it there. \n \n% PP: What was the first thing you did send through a network like this?\n% JH: I didn't do it myself, I remember it was a kind of chat program. On LLN side was Prof. Elie Milgrom, he is retired now. On this side, it was Prof.  Yves Willems. And I remember that they typed something and they got a response from the other side and that was it.  But I remember that Prof. Willems sent \"ok we stop now\". And that Elie Milgrom answered \"See you later, Alligator\" [a reference to Bill Haley and the Comets]. At the time we still had these kind of songs in mind. (lol). \nThose Unix to Unix connexions were first. And there was a worldwide Unix to Unix based network, Usenet (1979), it still exists somewhere... you can download load  of illegal movies and that stuff, that was not what we meant at the time. But that is what is left. And Usenet became gradually replaced by the Internet in USA. \nIn Europe, the Internet came a lot later, but we had limited access to the Internet by mail and even FTP; We could send mail to the Internet and we could receive mail from them, because Some friendly american university, later companies, did translate internet mail to UCP mail., moreover they did translate specially formatted mails into FTP request and send the result back to us by mail. That was before the 1990's.\n \n% PP: Your relation to software had changed at the time because you did not have to do all this manipulations with the software your received... Was it already floppy discs?\n% JH: No, magnetic tapes, for the mainframe at least. Even most of the mini-computers had some (cheaper) magnetic tapes. Between 90 and 95 the main machines used for  Unix software development was a VAX from DEC. Once a year the software came from Berkeley, it was still Unix but modified by Berkeley for virtual memory and all the stuff which are common now. We received a tape, with lot of goodies, I still remember we didn't know what was on the tape  but we did scrutinise it  to know what was on there, what we can use....\nIn Europe, companies like Siemens were trying to set up software centers to make software avaiable, they were even trying to set up European networks. But researchers did love the Internet, it worked, it was useful for their researchs. So companies in Europe, were trying to set up their own networks, I remember for example the X/OPEN transport protocol. Their was a lot of standards about what software layers should do, but it didn't succeed because around 1992 IBM decided to quit their own private network and to go forTCP/IP and was the switching point. \nEverything done for X/OPEN were suddently forgotten. For the mainframes, and certainly in Belgium computing was mainly mainframes, I'm talking about universities here, so when IBM decided to go for TCP/IP Univiversities did follow. \nBut the aceptation of TCP/IP was really slow. For example, Belgacom was not interested in running the Domain Name System so we did it here, for some time, starting in 1993 with Pierre Verbaten (https://www.dnsbelgium.be/en/history). Belgacom were focused on X25 (DCS - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X.25) so they missed it.\n\n% PP: It was like the french Minitel?\n% JH: Well, at that time we were really jealous about Minitel. Could you imagine that? Terminals?  At home? You could work home with a computer! You could send emails! All in one, a pc computer with a modem! \n\n% PP: How did the research about software evolved in the department?\n% JH: I am mainly talking about network research but here. There were people working on numerical analysis, computing, artificial intelligence ... I was just not involved in those research so I don't know much about it \n\n% PP: You were focused on software and network..\n% JH: Yes, we did produce some software. We did make software to generate compilers, there was some A.I. software in Prolog, numerical analysis  libraries... Some were sold or shared, it depends.  \nWe did sell some software since the beginning I think when it was not even a department but a professor and a couple of students.\n\n% PP: Is it when you joined?\n% JH: No it was already a department. I did study first industrial engeneering in electronics. At the time in electronics you did hear something about computers, I was interested in it. I wanted to know more. I heard Kuleuvenhad started a\n% year before a\ndegree in computer engeneering. It was the first year where industrial engineers could join. The only thing we knew about computer were from movies. I wanted to know how it work. I'm not sure if I know now it now, but I have some ideas...\n\n% PP: How many langage do you know?\n% JH: Assembly, FORTRAN, PL-1 the langage invented by IBM to be the universal one, C, Cobol. Perl, I don't know, some  more. I'm not fluent in any computer langage, but I can read any language especially well written, I know I can understand it and, if needed,  learn it... I know JAVA also. As a system administrator the thing I use most are the command line of UNIX and Perl. But that's because i'm more familiar with those two so it goes faster.\n\n% PP: How did you see the rise of personnal computer and the software that goes with?\n% JH: I have to admit that we missed it. We didn't see the new thing was powerful because available for everybody.  We were not impressed by the software. I remember windows 95, the news on TV, people sleeping on the street to get it. I remember when I get my first windows version, with a box of 22 floppies or so. Then I wanted to do something, to compile a program, but there was no compiler... We were used to Unix, a basic system but with a lot of utilities in it. Software was for us free, and we were used to have it free and on a pc it was not free anymore. \n\n% PP: Does that mean you didn't had a personnal computer until late?\n\n% JH: Yes. I think it was round 2000. I didn't needed it really. I got one when the belgian UUCP network became commercial. Of course I did not get Windows on it. I think we got Linux here in 1994. There was a guy involved in the kernel studying here. So we did used it very fast.\n\n% PP: So, what is software for you?\n\n% JH: For me software is the magic that make computer usable. I can only gives examples of what I mean by it. A PC without software most people, even computer scientists, can't do anything with it. You need basic software. Some software is already integrated in the computer hardware. Same for phones, tablets... The main characteristic, for me, is that it should be user friendly. That is very difficult I know, because you have to imagine what the people using your software are going to do with it and how they want to use it, that's the magic you need to solve.\n\n% PP: Is command line user friendly?\n\n% JH: Well, somehow you have to learn the Unix command langage; it is in fact a computer language where you can make all the constructs that other langages offers.\nYou can create loops, you can test, whatever. It's not so different from computer languages like C or JAVA or whatever. It is certainly programmer friendly.\n\n% PP: But it's already software, no? User friendly depends on what you put behind these words, no?\n\n% JH: Yes it's already software. I don't have a strong opinion about command lines. It depends on people. I can imagine that someone that has never heard about the command line expects that you click somewhere and it happens. But if you know the command langage it's sometimes perhaps easier or productive to type commands and let it run. Sometimes, I find it easier if I have a screen and a number of buttons and I don't have to imagine what happens behind that screen. And sometimes I want to do something with the command line, because I'm used to it. That's why I don't trust myself about user friendliness because I have a long experience in computer interfaces. I'm so used to some of them perhaps I can't even imagine that somebody else would like to do it otherwise or doesn't like what I'm used to.\n\n% PP: Apart from maintaining the museum, what do you work on? You are still active in the department even though you are retired?\n\n% JH: I work on sensors, in the internet of things world in one of the university spin-off. What I do for them is: wireless sensors need power, most  of them are on batteries. They have designed a complete system which should make the battery last for two, three, four years. They need a system to measure that. So I have been working on a mechanism to measure that without waiting four years. That's programming instrumentation computers to measure e.g. power or whatever. Most of it on Unix systems. \nThere are enough new or unknown things and maybe because I'm older, I have another way of looking at things, so we have a lot of discussions. They don't like my Perl, they use python, JAVA and those things... Perl, it has its disadvantage, but you can do a lot of things. Every  character has a meaning, that makes perl programs often unreadable.\nWith Python, you need all those libraries... It's easy when you know the libraries, what  you have to call. When you know the arguments of the librairies... so it's also complicated. And if the library changes for some reasons, there you go.\nIn my humble opinion it's the same with all the languages. It starts easy from scratch but if you have to interface them with existing things from the internet world or whatever it gets complicated.\n\n% PP: Do you have a last word?\n\n% JH: I was surprised by your group reaction to the visit. I thought all of this was known. Maybe I'm getting old :) Currently I don't do much about the museum department, but sometimes I like to talk about the little stories about it. I remember a lot of little stories, a lot of technics who have been used and forgotten and some kept alive. I thought when I was young that the best techniques would succeed. That you would have visionary people who would see the way. But I realized that a lot of things do happen by accident.\n\n\n\n\n\n","attribs":"*7+a*7*3+p*7|1+1*g|2+21*6|1+1*h+6*5+2w*f*5+8*5+h*6|1+1*5+4a*6|1+1*h+6+9*f+1+1o*d+n+1y*f+1+19*f+1+10*d+1+3e*f+1+3s*6|2+2+4n*6|1+1|1+1*h+6*f*5+4*5+t*6|1+1*h+6+l*h+1+16*e+1+17*f+2+1e*f+2+1e*d+2+3a*h|1+2*h*e+2*e+k+1*h|1+1+1j*6|2+2+1h*f+5+1h*7+1*0+k+44*7+1*0+l+2y*6|2+2+e*f+1+8f*f+1+p*d+1+q*f+1+d*d+1+3j*6|2+2+t*f+6+14*f+2+49*d+8+15*6|2+2*h+6*5+16*6|1+1*h+6+t*h+1+h*d+1+1u*d+6+1y*6|2+2*h+6*5+13*6|1+1*h+6+2p*d+1+3f*d+a+o*d+1+1b*d+1+2*d+l+9*d+2a+1*e+14+19*d+1+1b*d+u+1*6|2+2*h+6*5+1n*6|1+1*h+6+c*d+1+6*f+2+9*f+1+7*f+1+s*d+1+8*f+3+1k*d+a+9*d+1+1*d+1+r*d+u+1*d+n+e*d*e+4*e+8+1c*h+1+g*d+1+2*d+1+s*d+4+h*d|1+1+2r*d+9+1l*0+1+2s*d+3+33*6|1+1+41*6|2+2*h+6*5+15*6|1+1*h+6+i*f+1+7*f+1+3s*d+4+x*6|2+2*h+6*5+1r*f*5+1*5+z*6|1+1*h+6+8*f+1+7m*d+4+q*d+9+f*d|1+1+f*d+1+27*d+1+7*d+1+9*d+1+t*d+2+w*d+6+e*d+e+2*d+2+r*d+m+g*d+9+p*h|1+1*h*e+2*e+i*h|1+1+3q*6|2+2*h+6*5+1b*6|1+1*h+6+43*0+1+f*0+2+4*d+a+1g*d+n+z*d+2*h+1*d+1+3z*d+1+10*d+4+5*d+3+1n*d+6+p*d+4+f*d+1+1l*d+1+j*d+c+16*d+h+8*d+11+p*0+i*h+1*0+9*h+2*0+2a*h+1+1k*d+2+3f*d+4+1*6|1+1+x*0+1*h+2*0+d*h+1*0+11+1*0*2+1*0+37+2q*0+4+2*0|1+21*0+1f+1v*0+1+1*h+2*0+2d*h+1*0+d1*d|1+1*d+1+1j*d+a+1z*0+1*d|1+1+d*d+t+7*d+2+4*d+5+1*d+2+1*d+l+1*d+c+n*d+p+14*d+1+1k*d+9+1r*d+p+1q*h+1*d+p+c*d+6+7*0|2+2*h+6*5+1r*0|1+1*h+6+1i*h+1+2f*0+4+10*h+1+3s*h+1+1o*0|2+2*h+6*5+5i*0|1+1*h+6+i*d+1+1*d+2+29*d+7+1*0|1+1*d+2+1f*d+7+d*d+6+z*d+1+11*d+1+1*2+e*d*2+1*2+e*d*2+1*2+b+83*d+1j+2*0|1+1+1*0|1+1*h+6*5+1u*0|1+1*h+6+n*h+1+15*d+1+f*d+5*7+1+1k*d+3+1*d+6+d*h+1+2u*h+1+h*7+3+5f*d|1+1+90*d|1+1+1h*d+8+m*d+o+m*d+b+10*e+9+1*d+1+2j*d+35+r*0|1+1+1*0|1+1*h+6*5+4n*0|1+1*h+6+1c*d+6+z*d+1+6*d+2+1h*d+5+5*d+5+9*d+c+5s*h+1+1a*d+6+8*d+4+b*d+3+i*d+3+n*d+3*0|1+1+3o*d+9+a*d+5+42*h+1+46*d+b+2o*d|1+1+3n*h+1+21*d+i+7*d+1+1*d|1+1*d+1a+7p*0|2+2*h+6*5+v*0|1+1*h+6+5m*0|2+2*h+6*5+1q*0|1+1*h+6+1f*d+3+3o*h+1+q*0|2+2*h+6*5+16*0|1+1*h+6+5b*0|1+1+1a*h+1+2a*0|2+2*h+6*5+m*0|1+1*h+6+18*d+5+2z*h+1+l*h+1+1*h+1+u*d+8+d*h|1+1*h*e+2*e+d*h|1+1+27*d+1+1k*d+4+1h*d+4+9*d+e+i*0|2+2*h+6*5+t*0|1+1*h+6+2l*h+1+f*d+3+t*d+8+e*h+1+i*h+1+t*d+2+4*h+1*d+1+m*d+a*h+1*d+2+c*h+1+1h*d+2+3b*0|2+2*h+6*5+27*0|1+1*h+6+1f*d+2+4*d+6+c*d+y+3s*h+1+1x*h+1+21*d+2+3s*d+8+p*0|2+2*h+6*5+1q*h|1+1*0|1+1*h+6+2f*d+1+14*h+1+41*0|2+2*h+6*5+t*h|1+1*0|1+1*h+6+2i*h+1+3w*d+3+4l*h+1+4f*0|2+2*h+6*5+u*h|1+1*0|1+1*h+6+10*d+5+f*d+4+r*h+1+1x*0|1+1+2e*h+1+w*d+11*0|2+2*h+6*5+p*h*5+1*5+1u*h|1+1*0|1+1*h+6+3q*h+1+16*h+1+4m*h+1+j*h+1+17*h+1+1y*h+1+1h*h+1+q*h+1+1g*h+1+2c*h+1+2i*h+1+b*0|2+2*h+6*5+3f*h|1+1*0|1+1*h+6+2j*h+1+f*d+1+a*d+8+c*d+5+4m*d+6+3f*d+1+5*d+5+h*d+1+1*d+e+e*d|1+1+1l*h+1+a*h+1+3c*d+4*h+1+e*d+1+l*h+1+i*d+2+i*d+9+o*d|1+19+18*h+1+11*d+4*h+1*d+2+1v*h+1+r*h+1+n*d+1+w*d|1+1+1g*h+1+2f*d+1+1l*0|2+2*h+6*5+o*h|1+1*0|1+1*h+6+24*d+2+e*h+1+l*h+1+6*h+1+1m*h+1+4s*h+1+37*h+1+t*d+4+k*0|1+1*6|3+3*0|1+1|1+1"}}},"pad:observatory.guide.jeanhuensitvextended:revs:9801":{"changeset":"Z:fc4<1|2f=c31=1w|1-1$","meta":{"author":"a.PRabeGfk5jCXUq8V","timestamp":1518889503446}},"pad:observatory.guide.jeanhuensitvextended:revs:9802":{"changeset":"Z:fc3<1|2i=ccs=z|1-1$","meta":{"author":"a.PRabeGfk5jCXUq8V","timestamp":1518889505186}},"pad:observatory.guide.jeanhuensitvextended:revs:9803":{"changeset":"Z:fc2<1|2q=d3j=2q|1-1$","meta":{"author":"a.PRabeGfk5jCXUq8V","timestamp":1518889511474}},"pad:observatory.guide.jeanhuensitvextended:revs:9804":{"changeset":"Z:fc1<1|2l=ctj=10|1-1$","meta":{"author":"a.PRabeGfk5jCXUq8V","timestamp":1518889515139}},"pad:observatory.guide.jeanhuensitvextended:revs:9805":{"changeset":"Z:fc0<1|2s=dsq=3l|1-1$","meta":{"author":"a.PRabeGfk5jCXUq8V","timestamp":1518889519944}},"pad:observatory.guide.jeanhuensitvextended:revs:9806":{"changeset":"Z:fbz<1|2y=ew8=u|1-1$","meta":{"author":"a.PRabeGfk5jCXUq8V","timestamp":1518889526149}},"pad:observatory.guide.jeanhuensitvextended:revs:9807":{"changeset":"Z:fby>1|6=b5=b4*h+1$u","meta":{"author":"a.eJQfyC3773rYpTah","timestamp":1518890026036}},"pad:observatory.guide.jeanhuensitvextended:revs:9808":{"changeset":"Z:fbz>1|6=b5=cy*h+1$u","meta":{"author":"a.eJQfyC3773rYpTah","timestamp":1518890030220}},"pad:observatory.guide.jeanhuensitvextended:revs:9809":{"changeset":"Z:fc0>1|29=b7f=j*h*5+1$u","meta":{"author":"a.eJQfyC3773rYpTah","timestamp":1518890033836}},"pad:observatory.guide.jeanhuensitvextended:revs:981":{"changeset":"Z:5q6>0|18=505=o1-1*0+1$T","meta":{"author":"a.kqv62Q3nhchdwIuK","timestamp":1518090161557}},"pad:observatory.guide.jeanhuensitvextended:revs:9810":{"changeset":"Z:fc1>1|2a=b8g=12*h+1$u","meta":{"author":"a.eJQfyC3773rYpTah","timestamp":1518890036805}},"pad:observatory.guide.jeanhuensitvextended:revs:9811":{"changeset":"Z:fc2>1|2a=b8g=4h*h+1$u","meta":{"author":"a.eJQfyC3773rYpTah","timestamp":1518890039846}},"pad:observatory.guide.jeanhuensitvextended:revs:9812":{"changeset":"Z:fc3>1|2m=cup=1n*h+1$u","meta":{"author":"a.eJQfyC3773rYpTah","timestamp":1518890043523}},"pad:observatory.guide.jeanhuensitvextended:revs:9813":{"changeset":"Z:fc4>1|2m=cup=48*h+1$u","meta":{"author":"a.eJQfyC3773rYpTah","timestamp":1518890048955}},"pad:

HEADER: Interview with Jean Huens\n\n(%CARLINSAYS: Peggy can you fill in the when and where for this intro and add or change it as you seeThe following is a transcript of an interview with Jean Huens conducted by Peggy at X date and Y placewhen where ... interview with Jan Heuns, xxxx Peggy ... ]\n\n% PP: You have been using computers since a long time, as you explained us during the tour we had the joy of attending during the TGSO.\nI heard that that until recently, let's say the late 1990s, when learning computer programming you had to start by  writing down the program on paper... \n% JH: In 1973, I did study computer sciences, it was the second year of the Computer Sciense course, here in Leuven. At the time computers were mainframes and you did feed them with programms by punch cards. Programming was writing down the program, then you punched it and the next day you get results, mostly error. That's the way it worked at that time. To teach us programming, they used the language of that time, Fortran and some kind of invented assembly language, it didn't really exist, it was simplified.\n\nMost of the time you did write down your program, the teacher and the assistant would have to tell you what is wrong or good, you didn't had much practical experience.\n\n% PP: What was it like, tons of pages? \n% JH: No. As an anecdocte, I remember punchcards were a block of papers, we were jealous of the people who came into the computer center with huge stacks of cards. They were really small programs, not complicated one. In fact you had to learn to use the computer from scratch, everything was new, you couldn't rely on previous experiences.\n% , everything was new.\nAnd to start with small programs was difficult enough. \n\nThat was also the time when Edsger W. Dijkstra, who fought against the goto and other common but bad constructs.[@dijksra:1972:goto] I still remember him, in an audience, giving us a lecture on good  techniques in programming at the International computing symposium 1977 in Liège.[@dijksra:1977:craft] It was a rather hard course because Dijkstra expected you to quickly  understand and implement his ideas.\n\nAnd then from '75 on, computers became cheaper and could be bought by departments and smaller entities. And than came the first interactive computer. Still beasts about two cubic meters, costing two millions belgian francs. But it was low enough to allow people to type in directly commands. I started working here in '75 as a researcher, it has evolved continuously and I saw computers getting cheaper and getting easier to use.The way to use it was simplified, you could start to go to the beast and try it out.\n\nI remember more or less: you wrote down the program in Fortran for instance. We always thought in the beginning that it would work and it didn't, so after a turn around you were giving it back to the operator and you have to wait another half a day or a night to get the results.\n\n% PP: What kind of program you were working on? \n% JH: I remember the first program I had to write was: you got three numbers, you had to make the program decide if you could construct a triangle with the numbers being the sides of the triangle.\n\n% PP: That took an afternoon to be processed?\n% JH: Well, yeah. You had to imagine how to do it which was also one problem, than you prepare the cards with the punching machine and you give the package of cards to the operator who was feeeding the computer with the cards. Operator people had the taks to feed the computers by hands, with paper, cards, then cards got written on disks and later processed by the mainframe from disk. Finally results got printed on paper. it lasts onto the magnetic disks period. And after a number of hours or a night you got a listing, a piece of paper, with the results or program compilation errors.\n\n% PP: When where you able to record the program onto the machine?\n% JH: I think that happened between '75 and '80. After the punching cards, which were already a way to record the program, we had typewriters and then terminals. We could record the programs by typing it on the terminal  and the computer would store them on disk. We had magnetic discs. IBM had number for everything, I remember the 3300  [manufactured from 1970 on] was a magnetic disk. \nWe didn't touch the machines, operators would change the disks, we could only access the typewriter/terminal. That was our most direct connexion to the computer. The times were diffent. The mainframes were such huge costly beasts that it had operators day and night to keep it busy. Even at night there were two or three guys mounting tapes, dismounting tapes, that kind of stuff.\nhttps://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/42/IBM_magnetic_disk_drives_3330%2B3333.png/600px-IBM_magnetic_disk_drives_3330%2B3333.png\n\n% PP: When did you stop working with operators?\n% JH: Somewhere between '85 and '90. There were still operators at the main computer of the university, but there were also small computers, so researchers and student could have direct access when needed. \n\n% PP: When did you start to work with software sold by others or given away in order to do your research?\n% JH: You still need an operating system on the mainframe that was delivered by IBM or the constructor delivering the mainframe. When you bought mini-computers, which were the  smaller versions of mainframes, in most cases you did buy an operating systems, compilers and all the stuff you did need to be able to program or work  those things. \nIn most cases,  the computer sciences department did buy the mini-computer from, for instance *Digital Equipment Corporation*,  a manufactorer at that time, but they didn't buy DEC's  software. The DEC software  was not open source or free,  and as a university we could get Unix for free and could run it on those\n% digital equipment \nDEC computers. That is what the computer department of the University of Louvain la Neuve *l'unité d'informatique*, did and so did we.\n\n% PP: When did you start working with unix as an os? \n% JH: I took a trip to Amsterdam, it must have been in 1979/80… Well, the story starts in our french sister university (LLN) where they did have a PDP-11 with Unix on it. You could get Unix, at the time, when you were a university, from Bell Labs (part of AT&T), the american telephone company. AT&T was a mega organisation at the time [before the [dismantlment of AT&T/Bell system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breakup_of_the_Bell_System)]. Due to monopoly, the US authorities did split it up in different Baby Bells. One of the restriction was that the research baby bell, could not sell anything. There were computer scientists there, who did develop some interesting things (e.g. Unix). For universities you did get the source for free, but NO  support, nothing not even how to install it. In Unité d'informatique, where they had a [PDP-11/70](https://i0.wp.com/www.utterpower.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/pdp11-70-panel.jpg) they were lucky: they got the same computer that unix was developped on.  They got the disk by snail mail as a post-office package. They mounted it and it did spin up and they had UNIX.\nHere, we did have a cheaper PDP11, [the PDP 11/60](https://dave.cheney.net/tag/pdp-11). We got the Unix disk distribution from Bell Labs but we could not run it, because we got another type of disk(RK07). We could look at it but that was all, because our disc format was different than the one at Bell Labs. Somebody here (P.Verbaeten) did write a driver for that disk in l'unité \nd'informatique of LLN. But they did not have a RK07.  it did compile it but we couldn't try it because we did not have. The nearest place  with Unix and RK07 was in Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam.  Andrew Tenenbaum, who did write a number of books on operating systems, was working there. He was learning to speak dutch. We did understood his english better but his assistant explained that he needed to practice speaking Dutch because he would have to pass an exam. There we compiled Unix with an RK07 driver and stored it on a bootable RK07 disk. With that disk back in Leuven we could start Unix on our PDP11/60. An error in the process meant a trip Leuven-Amsterdam and back.\nIn my opinion the start of open source was Unix because everybody  had to maintain it by ourselves and we learned a lot from the sources. \nIn that time for software distribution you did have to store it on magnetic tape and send the tape us to different places with associated problems. For example,  the agents at the customs at the airport or post didn't know what to do with the tapes or discs in terms of custom clearance. They used magnetic or xrays as inspection tools and we had to write on the package that it should not be x-rayed. And sometimes we still got unreadable tapes/discs. \n\n% PP: So it took like weeks between the transportation, the custom...\n% JH: Yes, the custom had to clear the packages. I remember I've been in the customs in Zaventem. I had received a letter that my package from Bell Labs had arrived. I went there thinking I would have to pay something and go. But no. It had to be cleared so there wa some organisation that had to do administrative stuff, so I only got it a few days later. The response time was huge :)\n\n% PP: Than after that period of time how did you switch from that kind of collaboration on how to make software and make software work to collaboration on networks, between universities and researchers...\n% JH: In the Unix systems at that time there was a kind of networking protocol which did work on serial lines (UUCP).\nTo connect two unix systems together you only need a serial line. We had a line between LLN and Leuven, it's only 25 kms, but we had to ask Belgacom, then La Régie des Télégraphes et Téléphones, to get a modem to connect through their network and than over that modem you could reach an amazing speed of 300 characters per second. And that was the first communication. It did happened somewhere around 85. And then you had connexion with another computer, writing something here and do the transfer to the other computer and execute it there. \n \n% PP: What was the first thing you did send through a network like this?\n% JH: I didn't do it myself, I remember it was a kind of chat program. On LLN side was Prof. Elie Milgrom, he is retired now. On this side, it was Prof.  Yves Willems. And I remember that they typed something and they got a response from the other side and that was it.  But I remember that Prof. Willems sent \"ok we stop now\". And that Elie Milgrom answered \"See you later, Alligator\" [a reference to Bill Haley and the Comets]. At the time we still had these kind of songs in mind. (lol). \nThose Unix to Unix connexions were first. And there was a worldwide Unix to Unix based network, Usenet (1979), it still exists somewhere... you can download load  of illegal movies and that stuff, that was not what we meant at the time. But that is what is left. And Usenet became gradually replaced by the Internet in USA. \nIn Europe, the Internet came a lot later, but we had limited access to the Internet by mail and even FTP; We could send mail to the Internet and we could receive mail from them, because Some friendly american university, later companies, did translate internet mail to UCP mail., moreover they did translate specially formatted mails into FTP request and send the result back to us by mail. That was before the 1990's.\n \n% PP: Your relation to software had changed at the time because you did not have to do all this manipulations with the software your received... Was it already floppy discs?\n% JH: No, magnetic tapes, for the mainframe at least. Even most of the mini-computers had some (cheaper) magnetic tapes. Between 90 and 95 the main machines used for  Unix software development was a VAX from DEC. Once a year the software came from Berkeley, it was still Unix but modified by Berkeley for virtual memory and all the stuff which are common now. We received a tape, with lot of goodies, I still remember we didn't know what was on the tape  but we did scrutinise it  to know what was on there, what we can use....\nIn Europe, companies like Siemens were trying to set up software centers to make software avaiable, they were even trying to set up European networks. But researchers did love the Internet, it worked, it was useful for their researchs. So companies in Europe, were trying to set up their own networks, I remember for example the X/OPEN transport protocol. Their was a lot of standards about what software layers should do, but it didn't succeed because around 1992 IBM decided to quit their own private network and to go forTCP/IP and was the switching point. \nEverything done for X/OPEN were suddently forgotten. For the mainframes, and certainly in Belgium computing was mainly mainframes, I'm talking about universities here, so when IBM decided to go for TCP/IP Univiversities did follow. \nBut the aceptation of TCP/IP was really slow. For example, Belgacom was not interested in running the Domain Name System so we did it here, for some time, starting in 1993 with [Pierre Verbaten](https://www.dnsbelgium.be/en/history). Belgacom were focused on X25 (DCS - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X.25) so they missed it.\n\n% PP: It was like the french Minitel?\n% JH: Well, at that time we were really jealous about Minitel. Could you imagine that? Terminals?  At home? You could work home with a computer! You could send emails! All in one, a pc computer with a modem! \n\n% PP: How did the research about software evolved in the department?\n% JH: I am mainly talking about network research but here. There were people working on numerical analysis, computing, artificial intelligence ... I was just not involved in those research so I don't know much about it \n\n% PP: You were focused on software and network..\n% JH: Yes, we did produce some software. We did make software to generate compilers, there was some A.I. software in Prolog, numerical analysis  libraries... Some were sold or shared, it depends.  \nWe did sell some software since the beginning I think when it was not even a department but a professor and a couple of students.\n\n% PP: Is it when you joined?\n% JH: No it was already a department. I did study first industrial engeneering in electronics. At the time in electronics you did hear something about computers, I was interested in it. I wanted to know more. I heard Kuleuvenhad started a\n% year before a\ndegree in computer engeneering. It was the first year where industrial engineers could join. The only thing we knew about computer were from movies. I wanted to know how it work. I'm not sure if I know now it now, but I have some ideas...\n\n% PP: How many language do you know?\n% JH: Assembly, FORTRAN, PL-1 the language invented by IBM to be the universal one, C, Cobol. Perl, I don't know, some  more. I'm not fluent in any computer language, but I can read any language especially well written, I know I can understand it and, if needed,  learn it... I know JAVA also. As a system administrator the thing I use most are the command line of UNIX and Perl. But that's because i'm more familiar with those two so it goes faster.\n\n% PP: How did you see the rise of personnal computer and the software that goes with?\n% JH: I have to admit that we missed it. We didn't see the new thing was powerful because available for everybody.  We were not impressed by the software. I remember windows 95, the news on TV, people sleeping on the street to get it. I remember when I get my first windows version, with a box of 22 floppies or so. Then I wanted to do something, to compile a program, but there was no compiler... We were used to Unix, a basic system but with a lot of utilities in it. Software was for us free, and we were used to have it free and on a pc it was not free anymore. \n\n% PP: Does that mean you didn't had a personnal computer until late?\n% JH: Yes. I think it was round 2000. I didn't needed it really. I got one when the belgian UUCP network became commercial. Of course I did not get Windows on it. I think we got Linux here in 1994. There was a guy involved in the kernel studying here. So we did used it very fast.\n\n% PP: So, what is software for you?\n% JH: For me software is the magic that make computer usable. I can only gives examples of what I mean by it. A PC without software most people, even computer scientists, can't do anything with it. You need basic software. Some software is already integrated in the computer hardware. Same for phones, tablets... The main characteristic, for me, is that it should be user friendly. That is very difficult I know, because you have to imagine what the people using your software are going to do with it and how they want to use it, that's the magic you need to solve.\n\n% PP: Is command line user friendly?\n% JH: Well, somehow you have to learn the Unix command language; it is in fact a computer language where you can make all the constructs that other languages offers.\nYou can create loops, you can test, whatever. It's not so different from computer languages like C or JAVA or whatever. It is certainly programmer friendly.\n\n% PP: But it's already software, no? User friendly depends on what you put behind these words, no?\n% JH: Yes it's already software. I don't have a strong opinion about command lines. It depends on people. I can imagine that someone that has never heard about the command line expects that you click somewhere and it happens. But if you know the command language it's sometimes perhaps easier or productive to type commands and let it run. Sometimes, I find it easier if I have a screen and a number of buttons and I don't have to imagine what happens behind that screen. And sometimes I want to do something with the command line, because I'm used to it. That's why I don't trust myself about user friendliness because I have a long experience in computer interfaces. I'm so used to some of them perhaps I can't even imagine that somebody else would like to do it otherwise or doesn't like what I'm used to.\n\n% PP: Apart from maintaining the museum, what do you work on? You are still active in the department even though you are retired?\n% JH: I work on sensors, in the internet of things world in one of the university spin-off. What I do for them is: wireless sensors need power, most  of them are on batteries. They have designed a complete system which should make the battery last for two, three, four years. They need a system to measure that. So I have been working on a mechanism to measure that without waiting four years. That's programming instrumentation computers to measure e.g. power or whatever. Most of it on Unix systems. \nThere are enough new or unknown things and maybe because I'm older, I have another way of looking at things, so we have a lot of discussions. They don't like my Perl, they use python, JAVA and those things... Perl, it has its disadvantage, but you can do a lot of things. Every  character has a meaning, that makes perl programs often unreadable.\nWith Python, you need all those libraries... It's easy when you know the libraries, what  you have to call. When you know the arguments of the librairies... so it's also complicated. And if the library changes for some reasons, there you go.\nIn my humble opinion it's the same with all the languages. It starts easy from scratch but if you have to interface them with existing things from the internet world or whatever it gets complicated.\n\n% PP: Do you have a last word?\n% JH: I was surprised by your group reaction to the visit. I thought all of this was known. Maybe I'm getting old :) Currently I don't do much about the museum department, but sometimes I like to talk about the little stories about it. I remember a lot of little stories, a lot of technics who have been used and forgotten and some kept alive. I thought when I was young that the best techniques would succeed. That you would have visionary people who would see the way. But I realized that a lot of things do happen by

At the time computers were mainframes and you did feed them with programs by punch cards. Programming was writing down the program, then you punched it and the next day you get results, mostly error. That's the way it worked at that time. To teach us programming, they used the language of that time, Fortran and some kind of invented assembly language, it didn't really exist, it was simplified.\n\nMost of the time you wrote down your program, the teacher and the assistant would have to tell you what is wrong or good, you didn't have much practical experience.\n\n% PP: What was it like, tons of pages? \n% JH: No. As an anecdocte, I remember punchcards came in huge stacks, we were jealous of the people who came into the computer center with piles of cards.\nThey were really small programs, not complicated one. In fact you had to learn to use the computer from scratch, everything was new, you couldn't rely on previous experiences. And to start with small programs was difficult enough. \n\nThat was also the time when Edsger W. Dijkstra, who fought against the _goto_ and other common but bad constructs.[@dijksra:1972:goto] I still remember him, in an audience, giving us a lecture on good  techniques in programming at the International computing symposium 1977 in Liège.[@dijksra:1977:craft] It was a rather hard course because Dijkstra expected you to quickly  understand and implement his ideas.\n\nAnd then from '75 on, computers became cheaper and could be bought by departments and smaller entities. And then came the first interactive computer. They were still beasts, about two cubic meters, costing two millions belgian francs. But it was cheap enough to allow people to type in directly commands. I started working here in '75 as a researcher, it has evolved continuously and I saw computers getting cheaper and getting easier to use.The way to use it was simplified, you could start to go to the beast and try it out.\n\nI remember more or less: you wrote down the program in Fortran for instance. We always thought in the beginning that it would work and it didn't, so after a turn around you were giving it back to the operator and you have to wait another half a day or a night to get the results.\n\n% PP: What kind of program were you working on? \n% JH: I remember the first program I had to write was: you got three numbers and you had to make the program decide if you could construct a triangle with the numbers being the sides of the triangle.\n\n% PP: That took an afternoon to be processed?\n% JH: Well, yeah. You had to imagine how to do it which was also one problem, then you prepare the cards with the punching machine and you give the package of cards to the operator who was feeding the computer with the cards. Operators were people who had the task of feeding the computers by hand, with paper cards, and then the cards got written on disks and later processed by the mainframe from disk. Finally results got printed on paper. And after a number of hours or a night you got a listing on a piece of paper with the results or program compilation errors.\n\n% PP: When where you able to record the program onto the machine?\n% JH: I think that happened between '75 and '80. After the punching cards, which were already a way to record the program, we had typewriters and then terminals. We could record the programs by typing it on the terminal  and the computer would store them on magnetic discs. IBM had number for everything, I remember the 3300  [manufactured from 1970 on] was a magnetic disk. \nWe didn't touch the machines, operators would change the disks, we could only access the typewriter/terminal. That was our most direct connection to the computer. The times were different. The mainframes were such huge costly beasts that it had operators day and night to keep it busy. Even at night there were two or three guys mounting tapes, disc mounting tapes, that kind of stuff.\nhttps://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/42/IBM_magnetic_disk_drives_3330%2B3333.png/600px-IBM_magnetic_disk_drives_3330%2B3333.png\n\n% PP: When did you stop working with operators?\n% JH: Somewhere between '85 and '90. There were still operators at the main computer of the university, but there were also small computers, so researchers and student could have direct access when needed. \n\n% PP: When did you start to work with software sold by others or given away in order to do your research?\n% JH: You still needed an operating system for the mainframe that was delivered by IBM or the constructor delivered the mainframe.\nWhen you bought mini-computers, which were the  smaller versions of mainframes, in most cases you bought an operating systems, compilers and all the stuff you needed to be able to program or work  those things. \nIn most cases,  the computer sciences department bought the mini-computer from, for instance *Digital Equipment Corporation*,  a manufactorer at that time, but they didn't buy DEC's  software. The DEC software  was not open source or free,  and as a university we could get Unix for free and could run it on those DEC computers. That is what the computer department of the University of Louvain la Neuve *l'unité d'informatique*, did and so did we.\n\n% PP: When did you start working with Unix as an OS? \n% JH: I took a trip to Amsterdam, it must have been in 1979 or 1980. Well, the story starts in our French sister university (LLN) where they had a PDP-11 with Unix on it. You could get Unix, at the time, when you were a university, from Bell Labs (part of AT&T), the American telephone company. AT&T was a mega organisation at the time before the [dismantlement of AT&T/Bell system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breakup_of_the_Bell_System). Due to monopoly, the US authorities split it up into different Baby Bells. One of the restrictions was that the research Baby Bell, could not sell anything. There were computer scientists there who developed some interesting things (e.g. Unix). Universities got the source code for free, but NO support, nothing not even how to install it. In Unité d'informatique, where they had a [PDP-11/70](https://i0.wp.com/www.utterpower.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/pdp11-70-panel.jpg) they were lucky: they got the same computer that Unix was developed on.  They got the disk by snail mail as a post-office package. They mounted it and it did spin up and they had Unix. Here, we had a cheaper PDP11, [the PDP 11/60](https://dave.cheney.net/tag/pdp-11). We got the Unix disk distribution from Bell Labs but we could not run it, because we got another type of disk (RK07). We could look at it but that was all, because our disc format was different than the one at Bell Labs. Somebody here (P. Verbaeten) wrote a driver for that disk in l'unité d'informatique of LLN. It compiled it but we couldn't try it because we did not have a RKO7. The nearest place with Unix and a RK07 was in Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam.  Andrew Tenenbaum, who wrote a number of books on operating systems, was working there. He was learning to speak Dutch. We understood his English better but his assistant explained that he needed to practice speaking Dutch because he would have to pass an exam. There we compiled Unix with an RK07 driver and stored it on a bootable RK07 disk. With that\n disk back in Leuven we could start Unix on our PDP11/60. An error in the process meant a trip Leuven-Amsterdam and back.\nIn my opinion the start of Open Source was Unix because we had to maintain it by ourselves and we learned a lot from the sources. \nIn that time for software distribution you had to store it on magnetic tape and send the tape to different places with associated problems. For example, the agents at the customs at the airport or post office didn't know what to do with the tapes or discs in terms of custom clearance. They used magnetic or x-rays as inspection tools and we had to write on the package that it should not be x-rayed. And sometimes we still got unreadable tapes/discs. \n\n% PP: So it took weeks between the transportation and the customs?\n% JH: Yes, the custom had to clear the packages. I remember I've been in the customs in Zaventem. I had received a letter that my package from Bell Labs had arrived. I went there thinking I would have to pay something and go. But no. It had to be cleared so there was some organisation that had to do administrative stuff, so I only got it a few days later. The response time was huge.\n\n% PP: After that period of time, how did you switch from that kind of collaboration on how to make software and make software work, to another kind of collaboration on networks and between universities and researchers?\n% JH: In the Unix systems at that time there was a kind of networking protocol which worked on serial lines (UUCP).\nTo connect two Unix systems together you only need a serial line. We had a line between LLN and Leuven, it's only 25 kms, but we had to ask Belgacom, then La Régie des Télégraphes et Téléphones, to get a modem to connect through their network and then over that modem you could reach an amazing speed of 300 characters per second. And that was the first communication. It happened somewhere around 1985. And then you had connection with another computer by writing something here and doing the transfer to the other computer and executing it there. \n \n% PP: What was the first thing you sent through a network like this?\n% JH: I didn't do it myself, I remember it was a kind of chat program. On the LLN side was Professor Elie Milgrom. He is retired now. On this side, it was Professor  Yves Willems. And I remember that they typed something and they got a response from the other side and that was it.  But I remember that Professor Willems sent \"Ok, we stop now.\" And that Elie Milgrom answered \"See you later, Alligator\" [a reference to Bill Haley and the Comets]. At the time we still had these kind of songs in mind. (lol). \nThose Unix to Unix connexions were first. And there was a worldwide Unix to Unix based network, Usenet (1979). It still exists somewhere.You can download loads of illegal movies and that stuff. That was not what we meant at the time. But that is what is left. And Usenet became gradually replaced by the Internet in USA. \nIn Europe, the Internet came a lot later, but we had limited access to the Internet by mail and even FTP; We could send mail to the Internet and we could receive mail from them because some friendly American university (and later companies) translated internet mail to UCP mail. Moreover they translated specially formatted mails into FTP request and sent the result back to us by mail. That was before the 1990's.\n \n% PP: Your relation to software had changed at the time because you did not have to do all this manipulations with the software your received. Was it already floppy discs?\n% JH: No, magnetic tapes, for the mainframe at least. Even most of the mini-computers used some (cheaper) magnetic tapes. Between 1990 and 1995 the main machines used for Unix software development was a VAX from DEC. Once a year the software came from Berkeley. It was still Unix but had been modified by Berkeley for virtual memory and all the stuff which is common now. We received a tape, with lot of goodies, I still remember we didn't know what was on the tape  but we scrutinized it  to find out what was on there, what we could use...\nIn Europe, companies like Siemens were trying to set up software centers to make software avaiable. They were even trying to set up European networks. But researchers loved the Internet. It worked. It was useful for their research. So companies in Europe were trying to set up their own networks, I remember for example the X/OPEN transport protocol, which was a set of standards about what software layers should do. But it didn't succeed because around 1992 IBM decided to quit their own private network and to go for TCP/IP which was the switching point. \nEverything done for X/OPEN were suddently forgotten. For the mainframes, and certainly in Belgium computing was mainly mainframes, I'm talking about universities here, so when IBM decided to go for TCP/IP the universities followed. \nBut the adoption of TCP/IP was really slow. For example, Belgacom was not interested in running the Domain Name System so we did it here, for some time, starting in 1993 with [Pierre Verbaten](https://www.dnsbelgium.be/en/history). Belgacom were focused on X25 (DCS - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X.25) so they missed it.\n\n% PP: It was like the french Minitel?\n% JH: Well, at that time we were really jealous about Minitel. Could you imagine that? Terminals?  At home? You could work home with a computer! You could send emails! All in one, a PC computer with a modem! \n\n% PP: How did the research about software evolve in the department?\n% JH: I am mainly talking about network research but here. There were people working on numerical analysis, computing, artificial intelligence. I was just not involved in that research so I don't know much about it \n\n% PP: You were focused on software and networks?\n% JH: Yes, we produced some software. We made software to generate compilers. There was some A.I. software in Prolog, numerical analysis libraries, etc. Some were sold or shared, it depends.  \nWe sold some software from the beginning I think when it was not even a department but a professor and a couple of students.\n\n% PP: Is that when you joined?\n% JH: No it was already a department. I studied industrial engeneering in electronics first. At the time in electronics you heard something about computers, I was interested in it. I wanted to know more. I heard KU Leuven had started a degree in computer engineering. It was the first year where industrial engineers could join. The only thing we knew about computers were from movies. I wanted to know how they worked. I'm not sure if I know now it now, but I have some ideas.\n\n% PP: How many languages do you know?\n% JH: Assembly, FORTRAN, PL-1 the language invented by IBM to be the universal one, C, Cobol. Perl... I don't know... some more. I'm not fluent in any computer language, but I can read any language especially well written, I know I can understand it and, if needed, learn it... I know JAVA also. As a system administrator, the thing I use most are the command line of Unix and Perl. But that's because i'm more familiar with those two so it goes faster.\n\n% PP: How did you see the rise of personnal computer and the software that goes with?\n% JH: I have to admit that we missed it. We didn't see the new thing was powerful because it was available for everybody.  We were not impressed by the software. I remember Windows 95, the news on TV, people sleeping on the street to get it. I remember when I got my first Windows version, with a box of 22 floppies or so. Then I wanted to do something, to compile a program, but there was no compiler. We were used to Unix, which was a basic system but haa lot of utilities in it. Software was for us free, and we were used to having it be free, and on a PC it was not free anymore. \n\n% PP: Does that mean you didn't had a personal computer until late?\n% JH: Yes. I think it was round 2000. I didn't need it really. I got one when the Belgian UUCP network became commercial. Of course I did not get Windows on it. I think we got Linux here in 1994. There was a guy involved in the kernel studying here. So we did used it very fast.\n\n% PP: So, what is software for you?\n% JH: For me, software is the magic that makes computer usable. I can only give examples of what I mean by it. A PC without software -- most people, even computer scientists, can't do anything with it. You need basic software. Some software is already integrated in the computer hardware. It is the same for phones, tablets. The main characteristic, for me, is that it should be user friendly. That is very difficult I know, because you have to imagine what the people using your software are going to do with it and how they want to use it. That's the magic you need to solve.\n\n% PP: Is command line user friendly?\n% JH: Well, somehow you have to learn the Unix command language; it is in fact a computer language where you can make all the constructs that other languages offers.\nYou can create loops, you can test, whatever. It's not so different from computer languages like C or JAVA or whatever. It is certainly programmer friendly.\n\n% PP: But it's already software, no? User friendly depends on what you put behind these words, no?\n% JH: Yes it's already software. I don't have a strong opinion about command lines. It depends on people. I can imagine that someone that has never heard about the command line expects that you click somewhere and it happens. But if you know the command language it's sometimes perhaps easier or productive to type commands and let it run. Sometimes, I find it easier if I have a screen and a number of buttons and I don't have to imagine what happens behind that screen. And sometimes I want to do something with the command line, because I'm used to it. That's why I don't trust myself about user friendliness because I have a long experience in computer interfaces. I'm so used to some of them perhaps I can't even imagine that somebody else would like to do it otherwise or doesn't like what I'm used to.\n\n% PP: Apart from maintaining the museum, what do you work on? You are still active in the department even though you are retired?\n% JH: I work on sensors, in the Internet of Things world in one of the university spin-offs. What I do for them is: wireless sensors need power, most of them are on batteries. They have designed a complete system which should make the battery last for two, three, four years. They need a system to measure that. So I have been working on a mechanism to measure that without waiting four years. That's programming instrumentation computers to measure e.g. power or whatever. Most of it on Unix systems. \nThere are enough new or unknown things and maybe because I'm older, I have another way of looking at things, so we have a lot of discussions. They don't like my Perl, they use Python, JAVA and those things... Perl, it has its disadvantages, but you can do a lot of things. Every character has a meaning, that makes Perl programs often unreadable.\nWith Python, you need all those libraries... It's easy when you know the libraries, what you have to call. When you know the arguments of the librairies. So it's also complicated. And if the library changes for some reasons, there you go.\nIn my humble opinion it's the same with all the languages. It starts easy from scratch but if you have to interface them with existing things from the Internet world or whatever it gets complicated.\n\n% PP: Do you have a last word?\n% JH: I was surprised by your group reaction to the visit. I thought all of this was known. Maybe I'm getting old.\nCurrently I don't do much about the museum department, but sometimes I like to talk about the little stories about it. I remember a lot of little stories, a lot of techniques that  have been used and forgotten, and some techniques that have been kept alive. I thought when I was young that the best techniques would succeed. That you would have visionary people who would see the way. But I realized that a lot of things happen by accident.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","attribs":"+e*7|4+x*7+a*7*3+p*o|1+1*g|1+1*o+2k*n+1*o+24*q+1*o|1+8*6|1+1*h+6*5+1u*f*5+3*5+12*f*5+8*5+h*6|1+1*5+1j*f*5+7*5+29*m*5+1*7|1+1*6|1+1*h+6+9*f+1+1o*d+e*m+2*d+7+1y*f+1+18*f+1+10*d+1+3e*f+1+o*h+1+1t*h+1+1b*6|2+2+l*j+5+31*j+3+q*6|1+1|1+1*h+6*f*5+4*5+c*j*5+1*5+g*6|1+1*h+6+l*h+1+l*m+j+17*f+2+q*n+5+9*7|1+2+2*f+2+1e*d+2+3a*h+1*m+1+1j*6|2+2+1h*f+5+d*m+6+10*7+1*0+k+44*7+1*0+l+2y*6|2+2+e*f+1+2n*q+1+13*j+b+b*j+1+21*m+6+27*f+1+p*d+1+q*f+1+d*d+1+3j*6|2+2+t*f+6+14*f+2+49*d+8+15*6|2+2*h+6*5+l*j*5+8*5+d*6|1+1*h+6+t*h+1+h*d+1+m*j+4+17*d+6+1y*6|2+2*h+6*5+13*6|1+1*h+6+22*q+1+m*d+1+3e*d+8*j+8+5*j+4+b*j+5+3*d+1+1*j+3+y*m+1+5*7+1*m+5+2*d+1+2*m+4*d+l+9*d+2a*m+1+18*d+1+b*j+3+h*j+1+g*d+u+1*6|2+2*h+6*5+1n*6|1+1*h+6+c*d+1+6*f+2+9*f+1+7*f+1+s*d+1+8*f+3+1k*d+a+9*d+1+1*d+1+r*d+u+1*d+n+1p*h+1+g*d+1+2*d+1+s*d+4+h*d|1+1+2r*d+9+w*n+2+o*0+1+g*j+2+2c*d+3+24*j+2+z*6|1+1+41*6|2+2*h+6*5+15*6|1+1*h+6+i*f+1+7*f+1+3s*d+4+x*6|2+2*h+6*5+1r*f*5+1*5+z*6|1+1*h+6+8*f+1+5*j+2+l*j+3+1v*j+2*m+1+d*7|1+2+2q*j+6+1j*j+6+m*d+9+f*d|1+1+f*d+1+x*j+6+13*d+1+7*d+1+9*d+1+t*d+2+w*d+6+e*d+e+2*d+2+r*d+m+g*d+9+p*m+1+3q*6|2+2*h+6*5+w*j*5+1*5+a*j*5+2*5+2*6|1+1*h+6+1h*j+a+u*j+1+15*j+3+9*0+1+f*0+2+4*d+a+1g*d+n+7*j+1+r*d+2*h+1*d+1+1l*q+1+2c*d+1+15*d+3+6*j+2+19*j+1+8*d+6+9*j+1+4*j+1+a*d+4+f*d+1+1c*j+2+4*d+1+j*d+c+2*j+1+c*j+3+b*j+5+1*d+h+7*d+11+p*0+i*h+1*0+9*h+2*0+2a*h+1+1e*j+1+5*d+2+3e*d+1*m+3*7+1*m+5d*n|1+jk*m+2*0+3b*d|1+1*d+1+q*n+1+4*n+1+n*j+2*d+1+1y*0+1*d|1+1+d*d+t+1*j+3+4*d+5+1*d+2+1*d+l+1*d+c+k*d+p+13*d+1+n*j+7+x*d+9+1n*j+1+4*d+p+1q*h+1*d+p+c*d+6+7*0|2+2*h+6*5+17*j*5+5*5+a*j*5+2*0|1+1*h+6+1i*h+1+2f*0+4+10*h+1+25*j+1+1n*h+1+1l*j+1*0|2+2*h+6*j+5*5+k*j*5+1*5+2q*j*5+1*5+3*j*5+g*5+q*j*5+4*5+11*j*5+1*0|1+1*h+6+i*d+1+1*d+2+1l*j+6+g*d+7+1*0|1+1*d+2+d*j+1+11*d+7+d*d+6+z*d+1+11*d+1+1*2+e*d*2+1*2+e*d*2+1*2+b+1i*q+1+44*j+2+q*j+5+m*j+3+u*j+3+1*d+19*j+3*d+9+2*0|1+1+1*0|1+1*h+6*5+w*j*5+1*5+t*0|1+1*h+6+n*h+1+15*d+1+2*j+4+d*d+4*j+5*7+1+c*j+1+1*j+3+13*d+2*j+5+1*d+6+d*h+1+2u*h+1+h*7+2*j+5+f*j+3+c*j+1+4l*d|1+1+31*j+3+p*j+1+k*j+1+x*j+3+3i*d|1+1+1h*d+8+m*d+o+m*d+b+10*j+a+d*j+1+8*j+g+f*n+1+a*j+1+r*j+2*d+m*j+1*d+1f*j+1*d+w+r*0|1+1+1*0|1+1*h+6*5+4l*0|1+1*h+6+1c*d+6+q*j+5+5*d+1+6*d+2+p*j+2+7*j+2+l*d+5+4*d+5+9*d+c+1r*j+3+l*j+9+1s*j+2+1i*h+1+1a*d+6+g*j+1+1*j+1+1*d+3+4*j+8+a*d+3+g*j+4+5*d+2*0|1+1+2q*j+3+v*d+9+a*d+5+f*j+1+d*j+1+1*j+1+8*j+3+1j*j+1+16*h+1+1e*j+9+6*j+4+1d*j+1+1*j+1+t*d+b+1o*j+1+7*j+5+q*d|1+1+3n*h+1+20*j+4+1*j+1*d+c+6*j+2*d+1+1*d|1+1*d+9*j+7*d+s+3n*h+1+f*h+1+3m*0|2+2*h+6*5+v*0|1+1*h+6+4w*j+2+o*0|2+2*h+6*5+15*j*5+1*5+j*0|1+1*h+6+1f*d+3+2a*j+1+u*j+2+d*h+1+q*0|2+2*h+6*5+14*j*5+2*0|1+1*h+6+f*j+1+j*j+5+u*j+1+1*j+1+1v*j+6+14*0|1+1+3*j+4+f*j+4+f*h+1+2a*0|2+2*h+6*5+3*j*5+4*5+h*0|1+1*h+6+y*j+7+12*j+6+x*j+5+s*h+1+l*h+1+1*h+1+u*d+1*n+1*q+2*d+5*j+1+d*m+1+m*m+1+1k*d+1+1e*j+1+6*d+4+u*j+4+5*j+2+g*d+4+9*d+e+g*0|2+2*h+6*5+d*h*5+1*5+3*j*5+1*5+d*0|1+1*h+6+w*h+1+1n*j+3*n+1*h+1+b*j+3*n+1+2*d+3+s*d+8+5*h+1+9*h+1+i*h+1+t*d+2+4*h+1*d+1+m*d+a*h+1*d+2+b*h+1+17*j+1+a*d+2+z*n+3+29*0|2+2*h+6*5+27*0|1+1*h+6+1f*d+2+4*d+6+c*d+9*j+7*d+p+1f*n+1+2c*h+1+2*j+1+b*n+1+1i*h+1+21*j+1+m*j+a+j*j+2+23*j+3+1*j+5+5*j+2+4*d+5*j+3+p*0|2+2*h+6*5+1p*0|1+1*h+6+24*j+1+8*d+1+14*h+1+41*0|2+2*h+6*5+t*0|1+1*h+6+6*j+1+w*j+1+1f*h+1+y*n+1*j+1*n+1*j+1+2x*d+3+19*j+b+o*j+1+2k*h+1+3e*j+3+y*0|2+2*h+6*5+u*0|1+1*h+6+10*d+5+c*h+1+3*d+4+r*h+1+1l*h+1+c*0|1+1+2e*h+1+w*d+11*0|2+2*h+6*5+p*h*5+1*5+1u*0|1+1*h+6+3q*h+1+16*h+1+22*h+1+2k*h+1+j*h+1+17*h+1+1y*h+1+1h*h+1+q*h+1+1g*h+1+2c*h+1+2i*h+1+b*0|2+2*h+6*5+3f*0|1+1*h+6+q*j+1+b*j+1+19*j+1+7*h+1+f*d+1+a*d+8+c*d+5+4l*d+6+3f*d+1+5*d+5+h*d+1+1*d+e+e*d|1+1+1l*h+1+a*h+1+2z*n+1+c*d+4*h+1+c*j+2*d+1+l*h+1+7*j+1+b*d+2+i*d+9+n*d+d*j+1*d|1+v+18*h+1+11*d+4*h+1*d+2+1s*h+1*j+1+q*h+1+n*d+1+w*d|1+1+1g*h+1+2f*d+1+a*j+1+1a*0|2+2*h+6*5+o*0|1+1*h+6+24*d+2+e*h+1+e*m+1*7|1+1+3*h+1+6*h+1+1m*h+1+2s*j+4+1*j+6+s*j+1+9*j+q+s*h+1+37*h+1+t*d+2+j*0|1+1*6|3+3*0|1+1*j|1+1|1+1"},"pool":{"numToAttrib":{"0":["author","a.kqv62Q3nhchdwIuK"],"1":["author",""],"2":["italic","true"],"3":["underline","true"],"4":["color","red"],"5":["bold","true"],"6":["author","a.FU926FFohXIBYlwp"],"7":["author","a.PRabeGfk5jCXUq8V"],"8":["removed","true"],"9":["italic",""],"10":["heading","h1"],"11":["insertorder","first"],"12":["lmkr","1"],"13":["author","a.T2VW9Z1FoOo412v8"],"14":["strikethrough","true"],"15":["author","a.EXnmpSWanmHBGv1u"],"16":["author","a.I4FbrrCTDQNN8GIf"],"17":["author","a.eJQfyC3773rYpTah"],"18":["bold",""],"19":["author","a.E9CeYtsotzL7KxHP"],"20":["author","a.bVN586q4mt3cfvBN"],"21":["author","a.CR709lDV4oQ6pPzO"],"22":["author","a.cfH87GlVK65PsVJR"],"23":["author","a.Yuc89brzNTYjBp89"],"24":["author","a.ewuBafyMH3RsVLzO"],"25":["author","a.fFTmKQFAWMAyQMDn"],"26":["author","a.yVCbpaJKjZ0bTelk"]},"nextNum":27},"head":11265,"chatHead":10,"publicStatus":false,"passwordHash":null,"savedRevisions":[{"revNum":392,"savedById":"a.kqv62Q3nhchdwIuK","label":"Revision
