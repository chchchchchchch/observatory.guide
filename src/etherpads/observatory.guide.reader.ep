WHAT IS SOFTWARE\nViewing software in the long-term context of historical ’numerical artefacts’ is an occasion to reflect on the conditions of its appearance, and allows us to take on current-day questions from a genealogical perspective. What  is software? How did it appear as a concept, in what industrial and governmental circumstances? The selected texts explore the materiality of software, its relation to hardware, language, discourse and abstraction with each their own way of questioning and proposing agendas and assumptions.\n*\n*Herman Hollerith.

WHEN AND WHERE IS SOFTWARE\nHow do layers of abstraction have an effect on the way software is produced and vice versa? What is the space-time dimension of IT development or where and when is software made today? The way computer programs and operating systems are manufactured changed tremendously through time, so its production times and places changed too. From military labs via the mega-corporation cubicles to the open-space freelancer utopia, the texts in this chapter trace the ruptures and continuities in software production. From time-sharing to user-space partitions and containerization, this chapter looks at the separations at work. What happens to the material conditions of software production (factory labor, hardware but also minerals) when it evaporates into a cloud?\n\n*John Harwood, The Interface: IBM and the Transformation of Corporate Design, 1945-1976.

OBSERVATION AND ITS CONSEQUENCES\nThe development of software encompasses a series of practices whose evocative names are increasingly familiar: feedback, report, probe, audit, inspect, scan, diagnose, explore ... What are the systems of knowledge and power within which these activities take place, and what other types of observation are possible? The material in this section is a compendium of probes such as learning by doing; exploring software through the analysis of its language and grammar; critical ethnography and self-testing as a user. In addition, we have included some conventional methods and tools for increasing the performance and security of software. Appropriating them for Techno-galactic software observation first of all turns the gaze onto the process of observation itself, and eventually opens up possibilities to actively interfere with the functioning of software.\n\n*Lilly Irani, Hackathons and the Making of Entrepreneurial Citizenship, 2015 http://sci-hub.bz/10.1177/0162243915578486\n*Kara Pernice (Nielsen Norman Group), Talking with Participants During a Usability Test, January 26, 2014, https://www.nngroup.com/articles/talking-to-users/\n*Matthew G.

software.\n% HOW: Choose texts from different areas. Software observations are mostly done in the realm of the technological and the pragmatic. The ecology of texts around software includes first and foremost manuals, technical documentation, and academic papers by software engineers which all _live_ in different realms of expertise. More recently, the field of software studies opened up additional perspectives fuelled by cultural studies and sometimes philosophy. A Reader allows all of these different kinds of text to intersect and intermingle. It helps to understand the many types of vocabularies that exist around software, and to see what types of observation each of them invites.\n% WHO:\n% URGENCY:\n% NOTE: Selected quotes from the reader are used to introduce each of the chapter headers in this guide.\n% WARNING:\n% EXAMPLE: -\nSamples from the _Techno Galactic Software Observatory reader_:\n\n% Matthew G.

WHAT IS SOFTWARE\n\nViewing software in the long-term context of historical ’numerical artefacts’ is an occasion to reflect on the conditions of its appearance, and allows us to take on current-day questions from a genealogical perspective. What  is software? How did it appear as a concept, in what industrial and governmental circumstances? The selected texts explore the materiality of software, its relation to hardware, language, discourse and abstraction with each their own way of questioning and proposing agendas and assumptions.\n\n* Herman Hollerith.

WHEN AND WHERE IS SOFTWARE\n\nHow do layers of abstraction have an effect on the way software is produced and vice versa? What is the space-time dimension of IT development or where and when is software made today? The way computer programs and operating systems are manufactured changed tremendously through time, so its production times and places changed too. From military labs via the mega-corporation cubicles to the open-space freelancer utopia, the texts in this chapter trace the ruptures and continuities in software production. From time-sharing to user-space partitions and containerization, this chapter looks at the separations at work. What happens to the material conditions of software production (factory labor, hardware but also minerals) when it evaporates into a cloud?\n\n* John Harwood, The Interface: IBM and the Transformation of Corporate Design, 1945-1976.

OBSERVATION AND ITS CONSEQUENCES\n\nThe development of software encompasses a series of practices whose evocative names are increasingly familiar: feedback, report, probe, audit, inspect, scan, diagnose, explore ... What are the systems of knowledge and power within which these activities take place, and what other types of observation are possible? The material in this section is a compendium of probes such as learning by doing; exploring software through the analysis of its language and grammar; critical ethnography and self-testing as a user. In addition, we have included some conventional methods and tools for increasing the performance and security of software. Appropriating them for Techno-galactic software observation first of all turns the gaze onto the process of observation itself, and eventually opens up possibilities to actively interfere with the functioning of software.\n\n* Lilly Irani, Hackathons and the Making of Entrepreneurial Citizenship, 2015\n* Kara Pernice (Nielsen Norman Group), Talking with Participants During a Usability Test, January 26, 2014,\n* Matthew G.

The ecology of texts around software includes first and foremost manuals, technical documentation, and academic papers by software engineers which all _live_ in different realms of expertise. More recently, the field of software studies opened up additional perspectives fuelled by cultural studies and sometimes philosophy. A Reader allows all of these different kinds of text to intersect and intermingle.

WHAT IS SOFTWARE\n\nViewing software in the long-term context of historical 'numerical artefacts' is an occasion to reflect on the conditions of its appearance, and allows us to take on current-day questions from a genealogical perspective. What  is software? How did it appear as a concept, in what industrial and governmental circumstances? The selected texts explore the materiality of software, its relation to hardware, language, discourse and abstraction with each their own way of questioning and proposing agendas and assumptions.\n\n* Herman Hollerith.

WHEN AND WHERE IS SOFTWARE\n\nHow do layers of abstraction have an effect on the way software is produced and vice versa? What is the space-time dimension of IT development or where and when is software made today? The way computer programs and operating systems are manufactured changed tremendously through time, so its production times and places changed too. From military labs via the mega-corporation cubicles to the open-space freelancer utopia, the texts in this chapter trace the ruptures and continuities in software production. From time-sharing to user-space partitions and containerization, this chapter looks at the separations at work. What happens to the material conditions of software production (factory labor, hardware but also minerals) when it evaporates into a cloud?\n\n* John Harwood, The Interface: IBM and the Transformation of Corporate Design, 1945-1976.

OBSERVATION AND ITS CONSEQUENCES\n\nThe development of software encompasses a series of practices whose evocative names are increasingly familiar: feedback, report, probe, audit, inspect, scan, diagnose, explore ... What are the systems of knowledge and power within which these activities take place, and what other types of observation are possible? The material in this section is a compendium of probes such as learning by doing; exploring software through the analysis of its language and grammar; critical ethnography and self-testing as a user. In addition, we have included some conventional methods and tools for increasing the performance and security of software. Appropriating them for Techno-galactic software observation first of all turns the gaze onto the process of observation itself, and eventually opens up possibilities to actively interfere with the functioning of software.\n\n* Lilly Irani, Hackathons and the Making of Entrepreneurial Citizenship, 2015\n* Kara Pernice (Nielsen Norman Group), Talking with Participants During a Usability Test, January 26, 2014,\n* Matthew G.

METHOD: Prepare a reader to think theory with software\n% REMEMBER:\n% WHAT: Compile a collection of texts about software.\n% HOW: Choose texts from different realms. Software observations are mostly done in the realm of the technological and the pragmatic. Also the ecology of texts around software includes first and foremost manuals, technical documentation and academic papers by software engineers and these all 'live' in different realms. More recently, the field of software studies opened up additional perspectives fuelled by cultural studies and sometimes philosophy.

Software observations are mostly done in the realm of the technological and the pragmatic. The ecology of texts around software includes first and foremost manuals, technical documentation, and academic papers by software engineers which all 'live' in different realms of expertise. More recently, the field of software studies opened up additional perspectives fuelled by cultural studies and sometimes philosophy.

Software observations are mostly done in the realm of the technological and the pragmatic. The ecology of texts around software includes first and foremost manuals, technical documentation, and academic papers by software engineers which all _live_ in different realms of expertise. More recently, the field of software studies opened up additional perspectives fuelled by cultural studies and sometimes philosophy. A reader allows these different kinds of text to intersect and intermingle. It helps to understand the many types of vocabularies that exist around software, and to see what types of observation each of them invites.\n% WHO:\n% URGENCY:\n% NOTE: Selected quotes from the reader are used to introduce each of the chapter headers in this guide.\n% WARNING:\n% EXAMPLE: -\nSamples from the _Techno Galactic Software Observatory reader_, chapter: _Observation and its consequences_:\n\n% Matthew G.

METHOD: Prepare a reader to think theory with software\n% REMEMBER:\n% WHAT: Compile a collection of texts about software.\n% HOW: Choose texts from different realms. Software observations are mostly done in the realm of the technological and the pragmatic. The ecology of texts around software includes first and foremost manuals, technical documentation, and academic papers by software engineers which all _live_ in different realms of expertise. More recently, the field of software studies opened up additional perspectives fuelled by cultural studies and sometimes philosophy. A reader allows all of these different kinds of text to intersect and intermingle. It helps to understand the many types of vocabularies that exist around software, and to see what types of observation each of them invites.\n% WHO:\n% URGENCY:\n% NOTE: Selected quotes from the reader are used to introduce each of the chapter headers in this guide.\n% WARNING:\n% EXAMPLE: -\nSamples from the _Techno Galactic Software Observatory reader_, chapter: _Observation and its consequences_:\n\n% Matthew G.

software.\n% HOW: Choose texts from different realms. Software observations are mostly done in the realm of the technological and the pragmatic. The ecology of texts around software includes first and foremost manuals, technical documentation, and academic papers by software engineers which all _live_ in different realms of expertise. More recently, the field of software studies opened up additional perspectives fuelled by cultural studies and sometimes philosophy. A reader allows all of these different kinds of text to intersect and intermingle. It helps to understand the many types of vocabularies that exist around software, and to see what types of observation each of them invites.\n% WHO:\n% URGENCY:\n% NOTE: Selected quotes from the reader are used to introduce each of the chapter headers in this guide.\n% WARNING:\n% EXAMPLE: -\nSamples from the _Techno Galactic Software Observatory reader_, chapter: _Observation and its consequences_:\n\n% Matthew G.

METHOD: Prepare a Reader to think theory with software\n% REMEMBER:\n% WHAT: Compile a collection of texts about software.\n% HOW: Choose texts from different areas. Software observations are mostly done in the realm of the technological and the pragmatic. The ecology of texts around software includes first and foremost manuals, technical documentation, and academic papers by software engineers which all _live_ in different realms of expertise. More recently, the field of software studies opened up additional perspectives fuelled by cultural studies and sometimes philosophy. A Reader allows all of these different kinds of text to intersect and intermingle. It helps to understand the many types of vocabularies that exist around software, and to see what types of observation each of them invites.\n% WHO:\n% URGENCY:\n% NOTE: Selected quotes from the reader are used to introduce each of the chapter headers in this guide.\n% WARNING:\n% EXAMPLE: -\nChapters and index from the _Techno Galactic Software Observatory reader_:\n\n## I. WHAT IS SOFTWARE\n\nViewing software in the long-term context of historical 'numerical artefacts' is an occasion to reflect on the conditions of its appearance, and allows us to take on current-day questions from a genealogical perspective. What  is software? How did it appear as a concept, in what industrial and governmental circumstances? The selected texts explore the materiality of software, its relation to hardware, language, discourse and abstraction with each their own way of questioning and proposing agendas and assumptions.\n\n* Herman Hollerith.

WHEN AND WHERE IS SOFTWARE\n\nHow do layers of abstraction have an effect on the way software is produced and vice versa? What is the space-time dimension of IT development or where and when is software made today? The way computer programs and operating systems are manufactured changed tremendously through time, so its production times and places changed too. From military labs via the mega-corporation cubicles to the open-space freelancer utopia, the texts in this chapter trace the ruptures and continuities in software production. From time-sharing to user-space partitions and containerization, this chapter looks at the separations at work. What happens to the material conditions of software production (factory labor, hardware but also minerals) when it evaporates into a cloud?\n\n* John Harwood, The Interface: IBM and the Transformation of Corporate Design, 1945-1976.

OBSERVATION AND ITS CONSEQUENCES\n\nThe development of software encompasses a series of practices whose evocative names are increasingly familiar: feedback, report, probe, audit, inspect, scan, diagnose, explore ... What are the systems of knowledge and power within which these activities take place, and what other types of observation are possible? The material in this section is a compendium of probes such as learning by doing; exploring software through the analysis of its language and grammar; critical ethnography and self-testing as a user. In addition, we have included some conventional methods and tools for increasing the performance and security of software. Appropriating them for Techno-galactic software observation first of all turns the gaze onto the process of observation itself, and eventually opens up possibilities to actively interfere with the functioning of software.\n\n* Lilly Irani, Hackathons and the Making of Entrepreneurial Citizenship, 2015\n* Kara Pernice (Nielsen Norman Group), Talking with Participants During a Usability Test, January 26, 2014,\n* Matthew G.
