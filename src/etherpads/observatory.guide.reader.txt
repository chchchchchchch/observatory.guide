% METHOD: Prepare a reader to think theory with software
% REMEMBER:
% WHAT: Compile a collection of texts about software.
% HOW: Choose texts from different realms. Software observations are mostly done in the realm of the technological and the pragmatic. Also the ecology of texts around software includes first and foremost manuals, technical documentation and academic papers by software engineers and these all 'live' in different realms. More recently, the field of software studies opened up additional perspectives fuelled by cultural studies and sometimes philosophy.
