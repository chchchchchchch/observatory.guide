% METHOD: Prepare a reader to think theory with software
% REMEMBER:
% WHAT: Compile a collection of texts about software.
% HOW: Choose texts from different realms. Software observations are mostly done in the realm of the technological and the pragmatic. The ecology of texts around software includes first and foremost manuals, technical documentation, and academic papers by software engineers which all _live_ in different realms of expertise. More recently, the field of software studies opened up additional perspectives fuelled by cultural studies and sometimes philosophy. A reader allows all of these different kinds of text to intersect and intermingle. It helps to understand the many types of vocabularies that exist around software, and to see what types of observation each of them invites.
