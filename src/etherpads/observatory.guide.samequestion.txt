% WHAT: By paying close attention to the answers, and possibly logging them, observations about the ambiguous place and nature of software can be made.
% REMEMBER: The answer to this question will vary depending on who is asking it to whom.

"_It is difficult to answer the question 'what is software', but I know what is good software_"
[^]{Jean Huens (system administrator at the department of Computer Science, KULeuven)}

"_Software is a list of sequential instructions! Hardware for me is made of silicon,
software a sequence of bits in a file. But naturally I am biased: I'm a hardware designer
so I like to consider it as unique and special_".
[^]{Thomas Cnudde (hardware designer at ESAT - COSIC, Computer Security and Industrial Cryptography, KULeuven)}

"_This, you have to ask the specialists._"
[^]{Amal Mahious (Director of NAM-IP, Namur)}
